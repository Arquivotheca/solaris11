  Timeout processing.  This header is part of the event loop interface.
  This header is machine-independent; however, the implementation is
  machine-dependent.

  The fSshTimeoutStruct and its size is platform specific. The
  application MUST NOT directly access contents of this structure. It
  content is visible only because of the application may need to know
  its size for embedding timeouts into its own data structures. */

   The first parameter 'state' is either NULL or a pointer to a unused
   SshTimeoutRec structure. If 'state' is NULL, then
   ssh_register_timeout() will attempt to malloc() the memory for the
   timeout, and if it fails, then the timeout is not registered.  If
   'state' is not NULL, then the SshTimeoutRec instance pointed to by
   'state' will be used to contain the state for the timeout.

   The 'state' instance may be freed or re-used after the timeout has
   been executed (in the timeout callback) or cancelled. It is a fatal
   error to re-use timeout not yet triggered or cancelled.

   The arguments are as follows:
     state          A pointer to an unused SshTimeoutRec structure for
                    containing the state for the timeout or NULL.

 * ssh_register_threaded_timeout. That function can be called from
 * other threads also, and it will pass the timeout given to it to the
 * SSH main thread. When the timeout expires it is run on the SSH main
 * thread. If you want to the call to be done as soon as possible use
 * zero length timeout. The SSH library contains few other functions
 * that can be called from other threads also. Each of those functions
 * contains a note saying that they can be called from other threads
 * also.

/* Insert timeout to the SSH library thread on the given time. This
   function can be called from the any thread, provided that
   ssh_threaded_timeouts_init function is called before this. This
   function can also be called without calling the
   ssh_threaded_timeouts_init, but in that case this function assumes
   that there is no other threads and it will just call regular
   ssh_register_timeout directly. See documentation for
   ssh_register_timeout for more information. These timeouts can be
   cancelled normally using the ssh_cancel_timeouts, but ONLY from the
   SSH main thread. Note, also that there might be race conditions on
   that kind of situations, the other thread might be just calling
   this function while the SSH main thread is cancelling the
   timeout. In that case the timeout might be inserted again when this
   message from here receives the SSH main thread.

   ssh_xregister_threaded_timeout() calls ssh_fatal() if it fails to
   allocate the necessary resourecs.

   ssh_register_threaded_timeout()
   uses the store provided via the 'state' parameter to contain the
   timeout state and does not fail in this case. The store pointed
   to by 'state' can be freed after the timeout has been executed
   (e.g. in the timeout callback).  If 'state' is NULL, then
   ssh_register_threaded_timeout() attempts to reserve the store
   needed and fails silently if there is insufficient memory available.

   Threaded timeouts can not currently be canceled safely.
