  Thread API. This API has been designed to be as simple as possible
  to allow easy implementation on different platforms. For that reason
  there is no explicit thread destroy/cancel operation available at
  all.. (that would have required cancellation points/thread
  destructors, which hardly are common on all existing thread
  implementations.)
