/* Registeres a callback to be called when a handle is unregistered or

   If this function is called with a NULL operation handle, the
   destructor_cb is called inside the call. The application does not
   need to check whether the application returned NULL or a valid
   handle. The destructor will be called regardless.

   Attaching destructors is usefull for modules that pass handles from
   lower modules to higher modules. Usually the middle module needs to
   know, when the asynchronous call ends, so that it may free the
   allocated data that it has passed as parameters to lower modules.

   This function can be called multiple times for the same handle,
   even with the same callback and context. The callbacks are simply
   queued, and called whenever the ssh_operation_unregister is
   called. The destructor functions are called in the reverse order
   than they are attached to the handle.

   When the operation is aborted, the abort callback is called before
   the attached destructor callbacks. If the handle is unregistered,
   the asynchronous function should call the completion callback
   first, and then ssh_operation_unregister which will call the
   attached destructors. */
