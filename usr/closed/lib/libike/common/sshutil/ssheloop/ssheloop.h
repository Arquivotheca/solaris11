  Event loop API, contains event loop meta operations (start/stop/run)
  and associating operating system events (file handles) with callbacks
  and contexts. Implementations themselves are very platform specific.

/* The event loop guarantees that only one callback is running at any
   one time.  If any callbacks (in the same "domain" as the callbacks
   called by the event loop) are called from other threads, they must
   call this function to lock the event loop.  This function
   essentially takes a mutex that is locked by the event loop whenever
   it is running in a callback.  Holding this lock ensures that no
   other callbacks will be running in parallel.  This call will block
   until the callback mutex has been obtained.  Also, functions
   related to the event loop cannot be called from other threads
   (i.e., from somewhere other than a callback) without taking this
   first.  Beware, however, that calling this function twice without
   first releasing the lock will cause the application to hang.
   Taking this lock is automatically performed before calling any
   callback function defined in this file, or any callback derived
   from these. */

   to be executed.  Note that it is illegal to unlock and then reacquire
   this lock within a callback called with this lock held.  This is because
   the caller might have cached state that might be invalidated if this
   lock is momentarily released. */
