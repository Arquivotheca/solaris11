Utility functions for transferring packets over a SshStream.  This
basically provides functions for a SshStream implementation that
communicates using packets, and for a wrapper that takes a SshStream
and communicates with the other end using packets.  This module takes
care of packetizing, depacketizing, buffering, flow control, draining
buffers, and related details, reducing the burden of implementing
packet-based communication significantly.
