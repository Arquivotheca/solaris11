/* Decaying counters are used to get average running statistics out from the
   last n seconds. Each counter is allocated using ssh_decay_counter_allocate
   and that will start timer that will update the counter every m seconds. If n
   is less than 100 then m is n/10 seconds, if n is less than 300 then m is
   n/30 seconds, otherwise it is n/60 seconds. You can add numbers to counter
   using ssh_decay_counter_add, and you can get the current running statistics
   value from the counter using ssh_decay_counter_get function. When counter is
   no longer needed you can delete it using ssh_decay_counter_delete. */
