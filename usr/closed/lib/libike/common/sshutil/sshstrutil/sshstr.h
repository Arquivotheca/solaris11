   country specific ASCII sets. That would be almost impossible. It is
   hoped that the UTF-8 will become de facto standard in near future
   and atleast after 2003 as hoped by PKIX, thus we concentrate our
   support for that set.

   Why UTF-8 is the choice? Mainly because it extends the US-ASCII in
   a transparent way and has the full power of UCS-4 and UCS-2. I
   feel, and probably other too, that having just one common character
   set is best for us all. */
