/* A simple (deterministic) pseudo-random number generator.

   Main purpose of this file is to introduce a simple and standard
   mechanism for SSH software to generate random numbers in test
   programs in a deterministic way.

   For the convenience of test programs the caller can use the
   state passing approach, or the global state.

   The pseudo-random number generator is robust enough for usage in
   applications requiring randomness. Some features in this library
   are often lacking from more well-known libraries. Especially the
   `range' functionality should be valuable.

/***** Private structures. */

/* This section contains definitions of the internal representation
   of the pseudo-random number generator. This may change and applications
   should not rely on details of this section. */

/* The random number generation is based on following approach:

   Lagged Fibonacci generator (LFG) is used for generating individual
   pseudo-random numbers. The benefit is high-speed, and LFG's have
   good statistical justification. (At the moment the LFG uses a
   simple extension, which may cause unstable behaviour. More study on
   this will be conducted.)

   Inversive Congruental generator (ICG) is used to seed the
   LGF. ICG's are statistically very stable generators, however, in
   practice rather slow.  */
