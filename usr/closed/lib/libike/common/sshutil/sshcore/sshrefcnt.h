#ifndef SSHREFCNT_H
#define SSHREFCNT_H

/*
 * Generic macros for making reference counted objects. This is very useful
 * when using fsm threads and you want to change the configuration on the fly.
 * The old configuration data (i.e all data that is referenced by the running
 * fsm threads), must be kept intact untill the fsm thread exits, but when the
 * final reference to the object disappeares then the object should be
 * immediately freed (or closed).
 *
 * The usage is quite simple. First you add SSH_REF_CNT_DEFINE(object_type)
 * defines in the beginning of some header file that is used to define the
 * object_type itself. This will define new structure that contains the
 * original object and a reference counter. Then you replace all the
 * object_type type names with the SSH_REF_CNT_TYPE(object_type), so all the
 * places where you used to use object_type you now use the new reference
 * counted object type.
 *
 * The next step is to allocate new object. This must be done using the
 * SSH_REF_CNT_ALLOC(name, object) macro. The name is the variable of type
 * SSH_REF_CNT_TYPE(object_type), and the allocated object is stored there. The
 * object is the object itself to be stored in the reference counted object.
 * This can be function call to allocate the object. When the object is
 * allocated it already has one reference to it, namely the `name' variable
 * contains reference to it.
 *
 * When you want to get the actual object from the referenced object (of type
 * SSH_REF_CNT_TYPE(object_type)) you must use SSH_REF_CNT_REF(name) macro.
 *
 * When you want to take extra reference to the object you use
 * SSH_REF_CNT_INC(name) macro. That will return NEW object pointer that you
 * must store for later SSH_REF_CNT_DEC macro call. This new object pointer is
 * actually copy of the current value of the name, but because you quite often
 * use some global data to actually get the name, you cannot use that later
 * when you want to derefence the object. The global data might already be
 * freed at that point. So you want to store the object returned from the
 * SSH_REF_CNT_INC to thread or callback local data structure, and you don't
 * want to reference the global data again (the value of that might already
 * have changed).
 *
 * When you don't need the reference anymore you might free it by using the
 * SSH_REF_CNT_DEC(name, free_func) macro. The first object is the variable of
 * type SSH_REF_CNT_TYPE(object_type) that was returned by the SSH_REF_CNT_INC
 * macro. The second argument is operation that might be used to free the
 * object in case this was last reference to it. Note, that you normally give
 * the actual object to the free function, so you must use free function like
 * ssh_xfree(SSH_REF_CNT_REF(name)).
 *
 * Here is a short example:
