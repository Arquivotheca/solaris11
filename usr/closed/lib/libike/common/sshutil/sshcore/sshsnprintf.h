/* Type of functions that implement formatting `external' data types.
   `buf' is the buf where something should be written, `buf_size' the
   maximum number of characters that can be written. `precision' is
   either -1 or a non-negative number supplied by the user; its
   interpretation is chosen by the rendering function. `datum' is the
   actual value to render.

   The functions must return the number of characters written.

   If the renderer would have liked to write more characters than
   there was room in `buf_size', the renderer should return the value
   `buf_size' + 1 (but have written only `buf_size' characters, of
   course).

   As a relaxation, the functions ARE allowed to write the NUL byte at
   buf[buf_size], i.e. at the `buf_size'+1th character. However, this
   is not necessary and doing or doing not has no effect whatsoever.  */

                                   void *datum);

/* Write formatted text to buffer 'str', using format string 'format'.
   Returns number of characters written, or negative if error
   occurred. Buffer's size is given in 'size'. Format string is
   understood as defined in ANSI C.

   NOTE: This does NOT work identically with BSD's snprintf.

   Integers: Ansi C says that precision specifies the minimun number
   of digits to print. BSD's version however counts the prefixes (+,
   -, ' ', '0x', '0X', octal prefix '0'...) as 'digits'.

   Also, BSD implementation does not permit padding integers to
   specified width with zeros on left (in front of the prefixes), it
   uses spaces instead, even when Ansi C only forbids padding with
   zeros on the right side of numbers.

   This version can also be extended using %@, which takes SshSnprintfRenderer
   argument and void *, and calls that SshSnprintfRenderer function to render
   the actual data.

   Additionally, some versions consider running out of space an error;
   we do not, and instead return normally; this is consistent with C99
   standard.
