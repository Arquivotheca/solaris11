   Miller-Rabin primality test in which one iteration has probability
   1/4:th giving false answer. Thus the caller can assume that
   (1/4)^(`limit'), where `limit' is the argument, gives the probability
   that this method gives an false answer.

   It is known assuming Generalized Riemann hypothesis that sufficiently
   many tests of Miller-Rabin give proof of primality. (As this function
   is probabilistic there would still be some change of mistake.)

   It is very unlikely that numbers above 100 digits pass this test
   even with small `limit' (say, 5) and would not be provable primes.
