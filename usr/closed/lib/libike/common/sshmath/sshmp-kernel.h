/* Multiply the two SshWords `n1' and `n0' and store the result to
   `(w1, w0)'. `w1' is the more significant word and `w0' the less
   significant.

   The algorithm is the standard elementary-school method for
   multiplication: to calculate

         d c
       * b a

   calculate e = ca, f = db, g = cb, h = ad and sum up: (a-d are
   half-words, e-h are full words. e^ is the upper half and e_ the
   lower):

           e^ e_
        g^ g_
        h^ h_
   + f^ f_
   --------------

   Note: the code uses the variable `c' to store `g' and inlines the
   variable `h'.

   There are many possibilities for choosing how to perform the
   summation. We use this method: first add together

           e^
        g^ g_
        h^ h_

   If SshWord is `n' bits long, then

        g, h <= (2^(n/2) - 1)(2^(n/2) - 1) = 2^n - 2^(n/2 + 1) + 1.

   Obviously e^ <= (2^(n/2) - 1). Therefore the sum, S, is bounded by

        S <= 2^(n + 1) - 2^(n/2 + 1) + 2 + 2^(n/2) - 1 =
             2^(n + 1) - 2^(n/2) + 1

   Therefore, S can have wrapped around at most once.  If wrapping has
   happened (check if the result is smaller than e.g. `g'), remember
   the carry.

   We now have S = S^ S_.  The remaining addition is

                  e_
            S^ S_
         C
       + f^ f_

   The result will be in two words. The lower word is S_ + e_. This
   can be calculated by ORing because e_ < 2^(n/2) and S_ % 2^(n/2) ==
   0.  The upper word is calculated by adding S^ to f, and then the
   carry bit to f^ if necessary.

   [Why is this a good way for performing the summation?  Because the
   initial addition succeeds in adding five half-words together and
   still can produce at most 1 as a carry.  Adding e.g. the two
   left-most columns could give 2 as a carry which would lead to
   complications.]

/* This algorithm is based on an idea by prof. Peter L. Montgomery. It
   seems to be more suitable for word size multiplication than
   Karatsuba's idea. We describe the details of the algorithm.

   Note also that Henri Cohen discusses the generalization of this method
   in his book.

   Basic idea here is to compute w = n1*n0, 0 < n1, n0 <= W - 1, in parts as

     n0 = c + W*d
     n1 = a + W*b

   where W = 2^m, and m is the bit size of the computer word. Hence, this
   algorithm computes

     x = a*c and y = d*b

   from where

     z = (a + b)*(c + d) - (x + y)
       = a*d + b*c

   is calculated modulo W. That is, z = overflow*W + z', of which
   z' is computed.

   Montgomery's idea is to retrieve the overflow by a clever inequality. One
   has

     -2^m + 2^(m/2) < z - 2^(m/2-1)*(a + c + b + d) < 0,

   which implies that

     2^m - 1 > (a + c + b + d)/2 - z/2^(m/2) > 0.

   From this we can substitute the above as

     2^m - 1 + overflow*2^(m/2) >
         (a + c + b + d)/2 - z'/2^(m/2) > overflow*2^(m/2),

   which can be interpreted as a quarantee that computing

      t = (a + c + b + d)/2 - z'/2^(m/2),

   recovers the bits of the overflow exactly (by suitably masking the
   result).


   The most interesting aspect of this algorithm is that only three
   multiplications are needed. Also this algorithm seems to be
   slightly more efficient than Karatsuba with word size inputs. Perhaps
   this can be generalized.

   Also it needs only one conditional and hence may compete with the
   four multiplication variants quite favourably.

   There are cases when this algorithm is slower than method with four
   multiplications, as multiplication can be sometimes very fast relative
   to the speed of addition. However, on most platforms this method is
   likely to be the fastest. It is unlikely that much faster methods
   are available.

/* The long division macro.

   I. Interface

   Divide the two-word value `(n1, n0)', `n1' being the more
   significant word, by the single-word value `d'.  Store the quotient
   to `q' and the remainder to `r'.

   The preconditions for invoking this macro are:

   (1) (n1, n0) / d fits into a single SshWord, and

   (2) d is normalized, i.e. its highest bit is set.

   II. Method

   The method is derived from the standard elementary-school method
   for long division. The normalization idea comes from Knuth.

   The method is the following: Let (n1, n0) = (h3, h2, h1, h0),
   i.e. `n1' contains the half-words `h3' and `h2', and `n0' contains
   the half-words `h1' and `h0'. Let `d' = `(d1, d0)' similarly.

   We may assume n1 < d because q must fit into a single word.
   Standard long division would first divide (h3, h2, h1) by (d1, d0)
   and obtain the higher word of the quotient:

   :                         q1
   :                 _______________
   :           d1 d0 | h3 h2 h1 **

   However, we cannot do that because (h3, h2, h1) is longer than a
   single word. Instead, use the following idea (this is why
   normalization is used): compute an approximation of q1 as

      q1' = (h3, h2) / d1

   Let a half-word be `h' bits long. We find that

      q1' - q1 = (h3, h2, 0) / (d1, 0) - (h3, h2, h1) / (d1, d2).

   This cannot be less than zero because

      h1/(d1, d2) <= (2^h - 1)/(d1 * 2^h + 0) = 0,

   as far as integer division is concerned (and we are now performing
   integer division). An upper bound for the difference is obtained as
   follows: Assume (h3, h2) is the largest possible value i.e.  2^(2h)
   - 1. Let d2 be the largest possible value 2^h - 1 and h1 = 0. Let
   d1 be the smallest possible value, i.e. 2^(h-1).  The difference
   becomes

      (2^(2h) - 1)/(2^h 2^(h-1)) -
        { (2^(2h) - 1)/(2^h 2^(h-1) + 2^h - 1) }

      = 2 - { ... }

   But as shown above, the difference cannot be less than zero.
   Therefore the maximum difference is 2.

   This shows that *q1' lies in the set {q1, q1 + 1, q1 + 2}*.

   The next thing to do normally is to subtract
   q1 (d1, d0) from (h3, h2, h1):

   :                         q1
   :                 _______________
   :           d1 d0 | h3 h2 h1 h0
   :                -  ........
   :                      r2 r1 h0

   and then continue division by dividing (r2, r1, h0).  In other
   words, to calculate (h3, h2, h1) % (d1, d0).

   Here, calculate an approximation of this value as

     (h3, h2, 0) % (d1, 0) + (0, h1) - (d0 * q1') = (r2', r1')

   Which is the same as

     (h3, h2, h1) - q1' (d1, d0)

   and thus corresponds to the approximation of q1 that we computed.

   The next thing is to fix the remainder and the quotient in the case
   the approximation is wrong. This is easy. Because q1 is the correct
   quotient,

     (h3, h2, h1) - q1 (d1, d0) < (d1, d0).

   Therefore, if q1' > q1,

     (h3, h2, h1) - q1' (d1, d0) < 0.  (1)

   Thus while (h3, h2, h1) - q1' (d1, d0) < 0, decrement q1' by one
   and increment (r2', r1') by (d1, d0) to compensate for the
   decremented quotient.  This must be done at most twice because of
   the (q1 + 2) bound on the value of q1'.

   After these fixes (r2', r1') is the correct remainder.
   Then do the whole thing again but now divide (r2, r1, h0):

   :                          q1 ??
   :                     __________
   :               d1 d0 | r2 r1 h0

   This is done, of course, identically.

   III. Implementation

   In the SSH_MPK_LONG_DIV macro the following variables are used:

   __a  :  d1
   __b  :  d0

   __c  :  q1' and later q0'
     d  :  divider
   __g  :  a temporary variable that contains the values of
          (h3, h2, h1) - q1' (d1, 0) and
          (r2, r1, h0) - q0' (d1, 0)
   __h  :  a temporary variable to store q1

   The computation of q1' and q0' is performed by
   SSH_MPK_LONG_DIV_STEP. The remainder approximation (r2', r1') is
   calculated in SSH_MPK_LONG_DIV_STEP except that q1' (0, d0) is
   subtracted only in SSH_MPK_LONG_DIV_FIX_REMAINDER.  The reason is
   that the condition (1) is checked for by checking whether the
   subtraction wraps around or not and it is thus more natural to do
   it in that macro.

   (Note that

      (h3, h2, h1) - q1' (d1, 0) >= 0

   because q1' was obtained by dividing (h3, h2, 0) by (d1, 0).)

                                          -- Huima

   Remark. It is often possible to select the highest word of the
   divisor in such a way that it is of some special form. Here is a
   trivial one:

     d = 2^w - 1 (all bits are ones)

   now

     (n1*2^w + n0) = b1*(2^w - 1) + b0

     (n1 - b1)*2^w + (n0 + b1) = b0 < (2^w-1).

   We may write b0' = n0 + n1, and then b1' = n1. Iff 0 <= b0' < 2^w - 1,
   we're done, otherwise b0' must be too large.

   At this point we have b0' + b1'*(2^w-1) = n1*2^w + n0, as
   we have b0' - b1' + b1'*2^w = n1*2^w + n0. Thus it is sufficient to
   compute (b0' + b1'(2^w - 1)) / (2^w - 1) = b0' / (2^w - 1) + b1'.

   Hence, we can just continue with b0' with the same algorithm
   recursively. Namely the algorithm could be

     Input: n1*2^w + n0 and 2^w - 1
     Output: (c1,c0)

     Step 1. Write i = 0, c1_i = c1, c0_i = c0.
     Step 2. Write b1_i = b1_i + c1_i, b0_i = c1_i + c0_i.
     Step 4. If b0_i < 2^w - 1, return (b1_i,b0_i). If b0_i = 2^w - 1,
             return (b1_i+1, 0).
     Step 3. Write c1_{i+1}*2^w + c0_{i+1} = b0_i, i = i + 1, goto Step 1.

   It can be extended to divisors of form (2^w +- c), where c is reasonably
   small. However, this has very little use in computations with
   single word divisors.

   In our application it can be shown that 2 iterations are required at
   most. This code will be implement, however, later.
