  Sieve for small primes.

  Purpose of this file is to allow any application an almost endless
  source of small primes. E.g. you don't need to table them, or anything,
  just compute them with this program when needed and then use 'em.

  This code is reasonably fast, and compared to large integer arithmetic,
  for example, this won't slow down anything.

  OBJECTIVE:

    Replace the old SSH large prime seeking code with code that
    uses SshSieve and thus probably works faster and is cleaner.
