   for failure. It is up to the caller to check the crypto library
   state after these calls, since the crypto library might end up in
   an error state during these tests. (Of course, during initiated
   tests any of these routines returning FALSE would mean that the
   caller should force the crypto library into error state).  */

   arguments. They however must and don't assume that the object has a
   valid crypto handle attached to it. Thus you can pass objects which
