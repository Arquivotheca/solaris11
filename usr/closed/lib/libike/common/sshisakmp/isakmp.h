  /* There are two differnet retransmission timer settings, base and extended.
     Base is for normal use and extended is for those operations that may take
     long time (require user interaction etc, like extended authentication).

     The selection between base and extended retry timers are done using the
     flags given to the negotiation. If the SSH_IKE_FLAGS_USE_EXTENDED_TIMERS
     is set then the negotiation uses extended timers.

     The retry_limit is the maximum number of retransmission packets the
     library will send. When it reaches zero the negotiation is aborted.

     The retry timer (seconds and microseconds) specify the base interval for
     the retransmission packets. The first retransmission packet is sent after
     the that time. The next packet is sent 2^(retransmission packet number) *
     retry_timer etc. So if the retry limit is 10, and retry_timer is 0.5
     seconds (0 seconds, and 500 000 microseconds), first retransmission
     packet is sent out after 0.5 seconds, second packet after 1 second, and
     nexts after 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 seconds, and after that the
     negotiation times out.

     Another parameter that will affect retransmission timer is the
     retry_timer_max, that will specify the maximum time in seconds between to
     retrasmission packets. So if it is set to 30 seconds, and we are using
     retry_timer of 0.5 seconds, and retry limit is 10, then the retransmission
     packets are sent after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 30, 30, and 30 seconds.

     For the whole negotiation there is also a expire_timer that will specify
     the maximum time for the whole negotiation. After that timer expires the
     negotiation is immediately aborted. */
