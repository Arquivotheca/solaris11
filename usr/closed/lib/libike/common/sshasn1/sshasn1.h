  Definitions for ASN.1 tree handling routines.

  Design of the ASN.1 parsing here uses a tree presentation mainly for
  simplifying reasons. One could easily implement so-called lber
  library which would not expand the binary ber to a tree form,
  however, then decoding might get more difficult. Our experience with
  this construction has shown that it works reasonably well. One could
  argue in favor of lber implementation, however, some constructions
  are not available in lber which are useful.

  One could, of course, build a real ASN.1 parser, but we hardly need that
  much ASN.1. Indeed, the parser would in many cases be a lot more
  complex and difficult to maintain. Yet, it would ease development in
  some cases.

   Arguments are given as pointers. Arguments should be exactly in the

   It is also nice to know that the search procedure for tagged values
   is throughout the current list. Also in sets all values are always
   searched throughout the current list.

   The special form any is only matched if it is tagged. Special forms
   choice and optional do not have any options part. Also they are not
   guaranteed to work with very complex expressions. It is adviced
   that tagged any should be used in those cases with choice and
   optional.

   However, see the code which uses these for more examples and
   possibly discussion of the subject.

   Current implementation ignores the context argument.  */
