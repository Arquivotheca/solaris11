  Interface to handle data which is built of sequential
  BER data records. You can remove and add data records and
  also change the data of the records. This interface
  interprets BER records with class and tag zero as empty
  records. The data may become fraqmented in case of
  record removals and additions. This interface also contains
  routine for compress (defraqment) the data.
