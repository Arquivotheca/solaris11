The files here are based on the SafeNet QuickSec 2.1 distribution.  Only
the IKE code is used.  This code used to be from SSH, Inc., but then their
IKE/IPsec folks were sold off to SafeNet.

Any ssh* directory comes from the QuickSec 2.1 distribution.  The sshisakmp/
directory comes from their ipsec/ top-level directory, and all others come
from the lib/ top-level directory.

If any of these need assembly optimization, they can be dealt with in the
$(MACH) directories.
