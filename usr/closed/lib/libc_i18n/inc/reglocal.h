/*
 * Regular Expressions (RE) provide a mechanism to locate substrings
 * within a string from a character string template (pattern matching).
 *
 * The basic requirement of RE is to find the first occurance of a
 * substring within a string which completely matches the RE pattern.
 * RE shall also determine and report the longest possible substring.
 *
 * Each RE pattern is first compiled into an internal form by the
 * regcomp() function and saved in a structure which is later used
 * (repeatedly) by the regexec() function to determine whether the
 * RE pattern is found within a given text string.
 *
 * RE patterns are defined by two sets of mutually exclusive syntax:
 * Basic RE (BRE) and Extended RE (ERE).  By default a RE pattern is
 * parsed via BRE rules unless REG_EXTENDED is set in the cflags
 * argument of regcomp() function.
 *
 * The capabilities of each syntax are defined by POSIX 1003.2 "Shell
 * and Utilities" Specification, Section 2.8 "Regular Expression
 * Notation".  The following is a summary of BRE and ERE syntax:
 *
 *
 * ****************  BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSION (BRE)  ******************
 *
 *	Expression	Meaning
 *  ----------	----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  NUL		terminate BRE pattern and text string
 *
 *  c		match single non-special character
 *
 *  \s		match single special character
 *		    \.   \[   \\   \*   \^   \$
 *
 *		note: non-special character preceded by \ will match
 *		itself.
 *
 *		note: \ loses its special meaning within a bracket
 *		expression.
 *
 *  yz		concatenation of expression y followed by expression z
 *
 *  .		match any single character
 *
 *		note: . will not match NEWLINE if REG_NEWLINE is set
 *
 *		note: . loses its special meaning within a bracket
 *		expression.
 *
 *  ^		match beginning of line if first character of BRE
 *
 *		note: if REG_NEWLINE is set, ^ matches immediately
 *		after NEWLINE and REG_NOTBOL is ignored
 *
 *		note: ^ loses its special meaning when not the first
 *		character of BRE and not within a bracket expression.
 *
 *  $		match end of line if last character of BRE
 *
 *		note: if REG_NEWLINE is set, $ matches immediately
 *		before NEWLINE and REG_NOTEOL is ignored
 *
 *		note: $ loses its special meaning when not the last
 *		character of BRE and not within a bracket expression.
 *
 *  *		match zero or more successive occurances of
 *		preceding expression
 *
 *		note: * loses its special meaning if it occurs as
 *		first character of entire BRE, first character of
 *		subexpression or within bracket expression.
 *
 *  \{m,n\}	interval expression match repeated successive
 *		occurances of preceding expression, with m specifying
 *		exact or minimum number and n specifying maximum
 *		number of successive occurances where:
 *
 *		\{m\}   match exactly m occurances
 *		\{m,\}  match at least m occurances
 *		\{m,n\} match between m and n occurances, inclusive
 *
 *		note: m and n are decimal integers from 0 through
 *		RE_DUP_MAX.
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if m is greater than n or
 *		\{ is not followed by a valid interval expression.
 *
 *		note: interval expression loses its special meaning
 *		if occurs at beginning of entire BRE or after \(.
 *
 *
 *   Bracket
 *	Expression	Meaning
 *  ----------	----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  [...]	match any single character within braket expression
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if the bracket expression
 *		set of characters in empty.
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if [ is not preceded by \
 *		and not part of bracket expression.
 *
 *		note: special characters lose their special meaning
 *		within a bracket expression
 *
 *		note: ] loses its special meaning if occurs first
 *		in bracket expression. []...] or [^]...]
 *
 *  [^...]	match any single character except all characters
 *		within bracket expression
 *
 *		note: NEWLINE is not matched if REG_NEWLINE is set
 *
 *		note: ^ loses its special meaning if not first
 *		character of a bracket expression.
 *
 *  [[.cc.]]	collating symbol match all characters in order
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if the collating symbol is
 *		not a valid collating element of the current locale.
 *
 *  [[=c=]]	equivalence class expression match any collation
 *		element with same primary collation value
 *
 *		note: if the collating element does not belong to
 *		an equivalence class (no collating value), the
 *		equivalence class expression will be treated as a
 *		collating symbol.
 *
 *  [[:y:]]	character class expression match any character of
 *		class y.
 *
 *		note: the BRE will be in error if the class type is
 *		not defined by the current locale.
 *
 *  [a-b]	match any single character whose unique collating
 *		value falls between range starting (a) and ending (b)
 *		points.
 *
 *		note: - loses special meaning if occurs first or last
 *		in bracket expression. [-...] or [^-...] or [...-]
 *		or [^...-]
 *
 *		note: - loses special meaning if range starting or
 *		ending point in bracket expression. [--^] or [+--].
 *
 *		note: range starting and ending points may be
 *		collating element (excludes characters with no
 *		collating value), collating symbol ([. .]) or
 *		equivalence class expression ([= =]).
 *
 *		note: if an equivalence class expression is used, the
 *		starting/ ending point will be the lowest/highest
 *		unique collating value of all characters represented
 *		by the equivalence class expression.
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if the starting point unique
 *		collating value is greater than	the unique collating
 *		value of the ending point.
 *
 *		note: the BRE will be in error if ending point is also
 *		starting point of subsequent range expression.
 *
 *    Sub-
 *	Expression	Meaning
 *  ----------	----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  \(...\)	subexpression match whatever it would have matched
 *		without subexpression delimiters \( and \).
 *
 *		note: \( \) loses its special meaning within bracket
 *		expression.
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if subexpression is empty.
 *
 *  \n		backreference expression match the same string
 *		defined by preceding nth subexpression
 *
 *		note: n is a single decimal digit from 1 through 9.
 *
 *		note: the BRE is in error if less than n subexpressions
 *		precede the backreference expression.
 *
 * BRE Notes:
 *
 *  a)  Multiple duplication symbols applied to the same expression
 *		are invalid (e.g. c\{3\}*).
 *
 *  b)  BRE Order of precedence is as follows, from high to low:
 *
 *	1)  bracket symbols	[= =]  [: :]  [. .]
 *	2)  escaped character	\<special character>
 *	3)  bracket expression	[  ]
 *	4)  subexpression	\(  \)  \n
 *	5)  duplication		*  \{ \}
 *	6)  concatenation	ab
 *	7)  anchors		 ^  $

 *
 *  ^		match beginning of line if first character of ERE
 *
 *		note: if REG_NEWLINE is set, ^ matches immediately
 *		after NEWLINE and REG_NOTBOL is ignored

 *		note: ^ is allowed in alternate expression or within
 *		subexpression if occurs as beginning of line anchor.
 *
 *  $		match end of line; match NUL or NEWLINE

 *		{m,}  match at least m occurances
 *		{m,n} match between m and n occurances, inclusive
 *
 *		note: m and n are decimal integers from 0 through
 *		RE_DUP_MAX.
 *
 *		note: interval expression is invalid if occurs at
 *		beginning of entire ERE or immediately follows
 *		VERTICAL-LINE, CIRCUMFLEX or OPEN-PARENTHESIS.
 *
 *		note: an invalid interval expression will be treated
 *		as the characters themselves.
 *
 *  |		alternate match either expression separated by |
 *
 *		note: expression which matches first encountered
 *		string will be chosen.
 *
 *		note: if more than one alternate expression matches,
