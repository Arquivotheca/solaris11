1.0 code drop from Adaptec on 1/30/2003
=======================================
  This code is putback into S10 and S9U4. We did couple of 
  changes to this codebase to get it compiled under solaris tree: 

  1) Added chimosm.h to include list of adpu320/chim/hwm//hwmhrst.c

     #include "chimosm.h"
  
  2) The adpu320.c is modified for compiler warnings
     diff -r ./adpu320.c /ws/on10-clone/usr/src/uts/intel/io/adpu320/drv//adpu320.c

     ---
     >                  ((u_char *)virtualAddress < ((u_char *)dma_infop->virt_addr +

     < cfp->adpu320_timeout_id = timeout((void *)adpu320_i_watch,
     ---
     > cfp->adpu320_timeout_id = timeout((void (*)(void *))adpu320_i_watch,


Adding support for 1011
=======================
  Fix for bug#4846753: Update the nodelist for adpu320

Notes on packaging:
===================
   Adaptec packages their driver into a single package called ADPU320.
   But we chose to split our package into two separate packages:
         SUNWadpu320 - containing the solaris native driver
         SUNWradpu320 - containing the realmode driver

   Please also note that the master file entries corresponding to adpu320
   are contained in SUNWrmodr package.

v3.0 code drop from adaptec
===========================
 This putback contained a lot of fixes for clustering problems apart
 from syncing up with adaptec's latest codebase v3.0.
   4937387 syncing up with the latest adaptec adpu320 source drop v3.0
   4939202 powering off 3310 hangs both nodes of the cluster
   4947770 adpu320_IobSpecial in v3 driver may return NULL
   4947764 adpu320_intr does not claim HIM_LONG_INTERRUPT_PENDING
   4950375 adpu320_tran_reset checking wrong completion flag
   4950383 adpu320_drain_completed_queue() recurses
   4933078 adpu320 should implment tran_reset_notify() entry point
   4929931 adpu320 can not detect all the targets on the 3310 RAID box
   4920366 adpu320.bef should respect the BIOS setting for bus reset on initialization
