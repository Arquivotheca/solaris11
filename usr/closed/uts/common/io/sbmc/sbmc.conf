# This property is here if some one wants to switch from the original driver to
# the new ipmi driver and also wants to enable the sbmc compatibility layer, 
# in order to continue having the /dev/bmc device available for legacy support.
# 
# There are three things that need to be changed to switch to the drivers
# First the following property needs to be uncommented and set to one. Second
# the property bmc-enable in bmc.conf needs to be set to zero. Last the
# property ipmi-enable in ipmi.conf needs to be set to one. The system then
# needs to be restarted since once loaded these modules can not get unloaded
#
