A few of the files from the DIA/MITRE label encodings distributions
were intended as samples of a label_encodings(4) file.  They have
been openly delivered with Sun releases since SunOS CMW with the
full knowledge of the DIA/MITRE.  They live in the usr/closed
tree for convenience and delivery reasons.  It still seems reasonable
to distribute them in text form as samples with Trusted Extensions.

label_encodings.example
label_encodings.simple
are Sun created examples and are in usr/closed
for convenience of packaging and distribution.
