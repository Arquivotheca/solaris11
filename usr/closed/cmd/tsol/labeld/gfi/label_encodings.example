* This version of the label_encodings file encodes the Sun
* proprietary/confidential labels that are required by Sun's
* legal and information protection departments. The prefix
* SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL is ommitted from the labels for 
* brevity. This encodings includes some example department 
* names that can be used for controlling access to information
* across department boundaries. Commercial sites with different 
* requirements can copy this file and change the definitions to suit.

* This example shows how to specify labels that meet an actual 
* site's (Sun's) legal information  protection requirements for 
* labeling email and printer output. These labels may also
* be used to enforce mandatory access control checks based on user 
* clearance labels and labels and sensitivity labels on files 
* and directories.
