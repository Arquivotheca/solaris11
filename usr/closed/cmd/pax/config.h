 * DEF_AR_FILE - tar only (required)

 * DEF_AR_FILE should contain the full pathname of your favorite archive

 * TTY - device which interactive queries should be directed to (required)
 *
 * This is the device to which interactive queries will be sent to and
 * received from.  On most unix systems, this should be /dev/tty, however, on
 * some systems, such as MS-DOS, it my need to be different (e.g. "con:").

 * OFFSET - compiler dependent offset type
 *
 * OFFSET is the type which is returned by lseek().  It is different on
 * some systems.  Most define it to be off_t, but some define it to be long.

 * VOID - compiler support for VOID types
 *
 * If your system does not support void, then this should be defined to
 * int, otherwise, it should be left undefined.
 *
 * For ANSI Systems this should always be blank.

/*
 * SIG_T - return type for the signal routine
 *
 * Some systems have signal defines to return an int *, other return a
 * void *.  Please choose the correct value for your system.
