# Written by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se> for the OpenSSL

# CRYPTOGAMS licenses depending on where you obtain it. For further
# details see http://www.openssl.org/~appro/cryptogams/.
# ====================================================================
#
# 2.22x RC4 tune-up:-) It should be noted though that my hand [as in
# "hand-coded assembler"] doesn't stand for the whole improvement
# coefficient. It turned out that eliminating RC4_CHAR from config
# line results in ~40% improvement (yes, even for C implementation).
# Presumably it has everything to do with AMD cache architecture and
# RAW or whatever penalties. Once again! The module *requires* config
# line *without* RC4_CHAR! As for coding "secret," I bet on partial
# register arithmetics. For example instead of 'inc %r8; and $255,%r8'
# I simply 'inc %r8b'. Even though optimization manual discourages
# to operate on partial registers, it turned out to be the best bet.
# At least for AMD... How IA32E would perform remains to be seen...

# As was shown by Marc Bevand reordering of couple of load operations
# results in even higher performance gain of 3.3x:-) At least on
# Opteron... For reference, 1x in this case is RC4_CHAR C-code
# compiled with gcc 3.3.2, which performs at ~54MBps per 1GHz clock.
# Latter means that if you want to *estimate* what to expect from
# *your* Opteron, then multiply 54 by 3.3 and clock frequency in GHz.

# Intel P4 EM64T core was found to run the AMD64 code really slow...
# The only way to achieve comparable performance on P4 was to keep
# RC4_CHAR. Kind of ironic, huh? As it's apparently impossible to
# compose blended code, which would perform even within 30% marginal
# on either AMD and Intel platforms, I implement both cases. See
# rc4_skey.c for further details...

# P4 EM64T core appears to be "allergic" to 64-bit inc/dec. Replacing
# those with add/sub results in 50% performance improvement of folded
# loop...

# As was shown by Zou Nanhai loop unrolling can improve Intel EM64T
# performance by >30% [unlike P4 32-bit case that is]. But this is
# provided that loads are reordered even more aggressively! Both code
# pathes, AMD64 and EM64T, reorder loads in essentially same manner
# as my IA-64 implementation. On Opteron this resulted in modest 5%
# improvement [I had to test it], while final Intel P4 performance
# achieves respectful 432MBps on 2.8GHz processor now. For reference.
# If executed on Xeon, current RC4_CHAR code-path is 2.7x faster than
# RC4_INT code-path. While if executed on Opteron, it's only 25%
# slower than the RC4_INT one [meaning that if CPU µ-arch detection
# is not implemented, then this final RC4_CHAR code-path should be
# preferred, as it provides better *all-round* performance].

# Intel Core2 was observed to perform poorly on both code paths:-( It
# apparently suffers from some kind of partial register stall, which
# occurs in 64-bit mode only [as virtually identical 32-bit loop was
# observed to outperform 64-bit one by almost 50%]. Adding two movzb to
# cloop1 boosts its performance by 80%! This loop appears to be optimal
# fit for Core2 and therefore the code was modified to skip cloop8 on
# this CPU.

# OpenSolaris OS modifications
#
# Sun elects to use this software under the BSD license.
#
# This source originates from OpenSSL file rc4-x86_64.pl at
# ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-0.9.8-stable-SNAP-20080131.tar.gz
# (presumably for future OpenSSL release 0.9.8h), with these changes:
#
# 1. Added some comments, "use strict", and declared all variables.
#
# 2. Added OpenSolaris ENTRY_NP/SET_SIZE macros from
# /usr/include/sys/asm_linkage.h.
#
# 3. Changed function name from RC4() to arcfour_crypt_asm() and RC4_set_key()
# to arcfour_key_init(), and changed the parameter order for both to that
# used by OpenSolaris.
#
# 4. The current method of using cpuid feature bits 20 (NX) or 28 (HTT) from
# function OPENSSL_ia32_cpuid() to distinguish Intel/AMD does not work for
# some newer AMD64 processors, as these bits are set on both Intel EM64T
# processors and newer AMD64 processors.  I replaced this with C code
# (function arcfour_crypt_on_intel()) to call cpuid_getvendor()
# when executing in the kernel and getisax() when executing in userland.
#
# 5. Set a new field in the key structure, key->flag to 0 for AMD AMD64
# and 1 for Intel EM64T.  This is to select the most-efficient arcfour_crypt()
# function to use.
#
# 6. Removed x86_64-xlate.pl script (not needed for as(1) or gas(1) assemblers).
#
# 7. Removed unused RC4_CHAR, Lcloop1, and Lcloop8 code.
#
# 8. Added C function definitions for use by lint(1B).
