 * or it should point to a valid STACK_OF(X509) structure. pkey and cert can
 * be passed uninitialized.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   p12      - Structure with pkcs12 info to be parsed
 *   pass     - Pass phrase for the private key and entire pkcs12 wad (possibly
 *              empty) or NULL if there is none.
 *   matchty  - Info about which certs/keys to return if many are in the file.
 *   keyid_str- If private key localkeyids are to match a predetermined value,
 *              the value to match.
 *   keyid_len- Length of the keyid byte string.
 *   name_str - If friendlynames are to match a predetermined value, the value
 *              to match.
 *   pkey     - Points to location pointing to the private key returned.
 *   cert     - Points to locaiton which points to the client cert returned
 *   ca       - Points to location that points to a stack of 'certificate
 *              authority' certs (possibly including trust anchors).
 *
 * Match based on the value of 'matchty' and the contents of 'keyid_str'
 * and/or 'name_str', as appropriate.  Go through the lists of certs and
 * private keys which were taken from the pkcs12 structure, looking for
 * matches of the requested type.  This function only searches the lists of
 * matching private keys and client certificates.  Kinds of matches allowed,
 * and the order in which they will be checked, are:
 *
 *   1) Find the key and/or cert whose localkeyid attributes matches 'cmpstr'
 *   2) Find the key and/or cert whose friendlyname attributes matches 'cmpstr'
 *   3) Return the first matching key/cert pair found.
 *   4) Return the last matching key/cert pair found.
 *   5) Return whatever cert and/or key are available, even unmatching.
 *
 *   Append the certs which do not have matching private keys and which were
 *   not selected to the CA list.
 *
 * If none of the bits are set, no client certs or private keys will be
 * returned.  CA (aka trust anchor) certs can be.
 *
 * Notes: If #3 is selected, then #4 will never occur.  CA certs will be
 * selected after a cert/key pairs are isolated.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  <  0 - An error returned.  Call ERR_get_error() to get errors information.
 *         Where possible, memory has been freed.
 *  >= 0 - Objects were found and returned.  Which objects are indicated by
 *         which bits are set (FOUND_PKEY, FOUND_CERT, FOUND_CA_CERTS).
