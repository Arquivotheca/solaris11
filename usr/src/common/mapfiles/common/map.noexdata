# Link-editor mapfile to create a non-executable data segment definition
# within an executable.  Note that this only functions properly on the
# x86 architecture.  On SPARC, the data segment contains a Procedure Linkage
# Table (PLT) that must remain executable.
#
# As the data segment is extended by sbrk(2) to enlarge the heap, a
# non-executable data segment also results in a non-executable heap.
#
# The link-editor does not use this file automatically, so one must use the
# -M option to cc or ld:
#
#       cc -M /usr/lib/ld/map.noexdata myprogram.c
#

#
# Executables can also create a separate non-executable bss segment.
# This segment may use additional memory, but also results in a
# non-executable heap.  See /usr/lib/ld/map.noexbss.
#
# See also /usr/lib/ld/map.execdata.
