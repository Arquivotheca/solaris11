# Link-editor mapfile that enables the creation of a bss segment, and aligns
# the segment at 4MB.  This effectively provides an appropriate alignment for
# large page mapping of the heap, and thus can be useful when building dynamic
# executables.  See ppgsz(1).  Users are cautioned that an alignment
# specification may be machine-specific, and may lose its benefit on different
# hardware platforms.  A more flexible means of requesting the most optimal
# underlying page size may evolve in future releases.
#
# The link-editor does not use this file automatically, so one must use the
# -M option to cc or ld:
#
#       cc -M /usr/lib/ld/map.bssalign myprogram.c
