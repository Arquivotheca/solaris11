# Link-editor mapfile to create an executable data segment definition within
# an executable for applications which rely on this.  This is the default
# for 32 bit x86 executable and all SPARC executables; this mapfile is
# provided to facilitate an executable data segment for AMD64 executables.
#
# The link-editor does not use this file automatically, so one must use the
# -M option to cc or ld:
#
#       cc -M /usr/lib/ld/map.execdata myprogram.c

LOAD_SEGMENT data {
	FLAGS = READ WRITE EXECUTE;
};

#
# Executables can also create a separate executable bss segment.  Adding
# the following line creates a bss segment.
#
# LOAD_SEGMENT bss { FLAGS = READ WRITE EXECUTE };
#
# See also /usr/lib/ld/map.noexdata.
