# Link-editor mapfile to create a non-executable bss segment definition
# within an executable.  This mapfile is similar to map.noexdata that
# can be used on x86 architectures to create a non-executable data
# segment.  On SPARC, the data segment contains a Procedure Linkage
# Table (PLT) that must remain executable.
#
# As the bss segment is extended by sbrk(2) to enlarge the heap, a
# non-executable bss segment also results in a non-executable heap.
#
# The link-editor does not use this file automatically, so one must
# use the -M option to cc or ld:
#
#       cc -M /usr/lib/ld/map.noexbss myprogram.c
#
