A note on the file mont_mulf.c.

It is used as a starting point for the following hand optimized assembly files:

- usr/src/common/bignum/sun4u/mont_mulf_v8plus.s
 This file is used in the 32-bit pkcs11_softtoken library.

- usr/src/common/bignum/sun4u/mont_mulf_v9.s
 This file is used in the 64-bit pkcs11_softtoken library.

- usr/src/common/bignum/sun4u/mont_mulf_kernel_v9.s
 This file is used in the kernel RSA module.

We keep the .c file around for future reference.

See file bignumimpl.c for information about these preprocessor symbols:
	USE_FLOATING_POINT, PSR_MUL, HWCAP, UMUL64
UMUL64 is set in bignum.h based on architecture.
The other symbols are set in Makefiles, as appropriate.
