The source in this directory has been derived from
LZMA SDK 4.62 downloaded from http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html

In an effort to provide ease of syncing with the upstream
code, this source hasn't changed much. As such this code is
waived from the usual Solaris coding standards and is
particularly not lint clean. An effort has been made, however, 
to have the components compiled into the Solaris kernel be 
lint free (this includes LzmaDec.c currently)
