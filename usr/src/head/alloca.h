/*
 * Many compilation systems depend upon the use of special functions
 * built into the the compilation system to handle variable argument
 * lists and stack allocations.  The method to obtain this in SunOS
 * is to define the feature test macro "__BUILTIN_VA_ARG_INCR" which
 * enables the following special built-in functions:
 *	__builtin_alloca
 *	__builtin_va_alist
 *	__builtin_va_arg_incr
 * It is intended that the compilation system define this feature test
 * macro, not the user of the system.
 *
 * The tests on the processor type are to provide a transitional period
 * for existing compilation systems, and may be removed in a future
 * release.
