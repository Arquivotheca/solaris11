/*
 * Even though the contents of the stdio FILE structure have always been
 * private to the stdio implementation, over the years some programs have
 * needed to get information about a stdio stream that was not accessible
 * through a supported interface. These programs have resorted to accessing
 * fields of the FILE structure directly, rendering them possibly non-portable
 * to new implementations of stdio, or more likely, preventing enhancements
 * to stdio because those programs will break.
 *
 * In the 64-bit world, the FILE structure is opaque. The routines here
 * are provided as a way to get the information that used to be retrieved
 * directly from the FILE structure. They are based on the needs of
 * existing programs (such as 'mh' and 'emacs'), so they may be extended
 * as other programs are ported. Though they may still be non-portable to
 * other operating systems, they will work from each Solaris release to
 * the next. More portable interfaces are being developed.
