/*
 * This header file defines two different versions of the
 * ufsdump/ufsrestore interface.  If the defined constant
 * SUPPORTS_MTB_TAPE_FORMAT is set, the data structures in
 * this header file will support backups of more than 2 terabytes
 * of data.
 *
 * In the old format (the format that only supports dumps
 * of less than 2 terabytes), TP_BSIZE is the size of file blocks
 * on the dump tapes.
 * Note that TP_BSIZE must be a multiple of DEV_BSIZE.
 *
 * In the new format, tp_bsize is used to store the
 * tape block size, which is variable.  The tape block size
 * is like 'fragsize', in that 'c_tapea' in each tape record
 * contains the 'tape block record' number in a signed int.
 * We set TP_BSIZE_MAX to 65536, which will handle 128TB
 * of data.  The new format is indicated by a magic number
 * in the tape header of MTB_MAGIC.  The new format is only
 * used when the size of the backup exceeds 2 TB.  If the
 * backup can be stored in less thatn 2 TB, ufsdump still
 * uses the format indicated by the NFS_MAGIC magic number.
 * Therefore, backups of less than 2 TB are still readable
 * by earlier versions of ufsrestore.
 *
 * NTREC is the number of TP_BSIZE blocks that are written
 * in each tape record. HIGHDENSITYTREC is the number of
 * TP_BSIZE blocks that are written in each tape record on
 * 6250 BPI or higher density tapes.  CARTRIDGETREC is the
 * number of TP_BSIZE (or tp_bsize) blocks that are written
 * in each tape record on cartridge tapes.
 *
 * TP_NINDIR is the number of indirect pointers in a TS_INODE
 * or TS_ADDR record. Note that it must be a power of two.
