 *
 * This header defines the va_copy variable argument macro, which is
 * new in ISO C 1999, and thus not present in ISO C 1989 and ISO C++
 * 1998.  Because this macro is a long-standing Solaris extension, it
 * is also permitted in other contexts.
 *
 * The varargs definitions within this header are defined in terms of
 * implementation definitions.  These implementation definitions reside
 * in <sys/va_list.h>.  This organization enables protected use of
 * the implementation by other standard headers without introducing
 * names into the users' namespace.
