	The contents of this xmod directory should only be of interest
to those who build releases and deliver source files for the source
product to release engineering.  Most developers will want to ignore
this directory unless they are responsible for internal source that
should be excluded from binary and source products.

    xmod_files - files deleted by 'make EXPORT_SRC' in usr/src
    cry_files - files saved after 'make CRYPT_SRC' in usr/src. They can
                then be added to the result of 'make EXPORT_SRC' and built
                to generate the domestic source product.
