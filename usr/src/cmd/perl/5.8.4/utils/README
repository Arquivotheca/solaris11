This directory contains utilities that help port a standard perl 5.8.4 build
directory into the ON tree and patched versions of standard perl files needed
to work around build issues.

lib/ExtUtils/MM.pm
lib/ExtUtils/MM_Solaris_ON.pm
The standard MakeMaker framework is obviously not ON-aware and we can't patch
the version we ship.  The port/lib directory contains replacement MakeMaker
components that are ON-aware.  We arrange for these versions to be used during
the build in preference to the standard ones by setting PERL5INC appropriately
in the environment.  See the source files themselves for details of the changes
that were necessary.

port
This directory contains scripts and data files used to port a stock perl 5.8.4
source tree into an ON workspace.  See the README in port for details.
