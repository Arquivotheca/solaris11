This directory contains utilities that help port and patch a standard perl
5.8.4 build directory into the ON tree.  It is hoped that future ports and
patches will be able to use the same framework, so details of the process used
for 5.8.4 are documented here.

Porting
=======

Step 1.
-------
Build and install perl 5.8.4 for both the sparc and i386 architectures.  To do
this, unpack perl 5.8.4 and then run the InstallPerl script from inside the
directory.  This script needs to be setuid root, and will install perl under
/usr/perl5, and will generate the correct config.sh file.  A series of status
files will be generated in the perl build directory.  These files are then
used in step 2 to automatically figure out which files need to be integrated
into ON.  The files are build.touched, test.log and install.packlist.

Step 2.
-------
From the perl build directory, run the MapFiles script.  This will produce
a CSV file describing all the files that need to be integrated into ON, using
the information captured by step 1.  The spreadsheet can be viewed in
StarOffice.  The file flist_5.8.4_s10.csv in this directory is the output of
the MapFiles script.

Step 3.
-------
Run the CheckIn script, giving as parameters the CSV file, the perl build
directory and the workspace that perl is to be checked in to.  The script
outputs a shell script to stdout, the script contains the commands necessary
to check the perl source into ON.

Step 4.
-------
Verify that the resulting script looks sane, then run it to perform the
integration.  Examine the output to make sure that the integration succeeded.

Step 5.
------
Make sure you have a config.sh for both the sparc and x86 architectures, and
that they are checked in.

Step 6.
-------
Generate the makefiles and associated infrastructure to build the resulting
perl 5.8.4 workspace.  These were based on the 5.8.3 versions.  Things that
need to be done manually, in no particular order:
	a) Merge in the ON-specific changes into installperl fromm the previous
	   perl version.
	b) Merge in the ON-specific changes into MakeMaker (under utils/lib)
	   using the standard perl files as a starting point.
	c) Generate Config.pm files for contrib/Sun/Solaris/PerlGcc and
	   make any other necessary changes for the new OS and/or perl version.
