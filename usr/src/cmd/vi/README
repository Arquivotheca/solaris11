  This directory and its subdirectories contain the files necessary
for making ex/vi in the AT&T UNIX environment: 

	This is a list of all the important directories and what's
	hidden under each.

	misc - contains files used in the "make" of ex/vi
	      { mkstr.c, xstr.c ...}
	
	port - ex/vi source directory.

	local - contains "uparm.h" which must be edited to
		reflect your system setup!
		EXAMPLE:
		--------
		#define libpath(file) "/usr/lib/file"
		#define loclibpath(file) "/usr/lib/file"
		#define binpath(file) "/usr/lbin/file"
		#define usrpath(file) "/usr/file"
		** libpath is where ex/vi expects the strings file
		(exstrings...this file is made as the ex/vi source 
		is compiled), and ex/vi 's recover & preserve commands
		(exrecover and expreserve).
		** usrpath is where the preserved files are held after
		a hangup or fail..."preserve" is tacked onto
		the end of the usrpath string .

	PATHs to look at (and possibly change) include: 

	  port/makefile.usg   ---|
	  preserve and recover commands all are installed in
	  ${LIBDIR}....make sure this is where you
	  want them to go.  This path must be the same as
	  the path defined in local/uparm.h ...c variable
	  name is usrpath.

	     In the event of a hangup, the editor will place a
	  copy of the temporary file in /usr/preserve.
