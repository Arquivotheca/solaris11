This is version SVR3.1 of the editor.
The version variable is set in ex.c.

The header file local/uparm.h should be installed, as ex_tune.h needs it.
The contents of this header file can be modified if you wish to place
the editor in a nonstandard location.

Conditional compilation flags:

	-DTRACE		for debugging (the original command line syntax
			 was "[-T [suffix]]"; this has been changed to be:
			 "[-T] [-S suffix]" in order to standardize
			 command line syntax.  For the moment, BOTH
			 forms are acceptable; in the future, the original
			 form will be dropped to eliminate the optional
			 argument to the option T.
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for visual on
			 upper case only terminals.
