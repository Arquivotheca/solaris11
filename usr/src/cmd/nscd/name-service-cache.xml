    This is the obsolete S10/S11 Pre-SMF name-service-cache service.
    It has been replaced by system/name-service/cache.  This service
    Is kept as a placeholder only and will be removed in a future
    release.  It's current purpose is to act as a optional dependency
    on system/name-service/cache, in case some extern script depends
    onthis service name.  It performs no other useful function.
