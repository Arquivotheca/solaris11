# If we previously crashed early in boot before dumpadm was used to configure
# an alternate dump device, then the dump is in the primary swap partition,
# which was configured as the dump device by the first swapadd early in boot.
# Thus before we run dumpadm to configure the dump device, we first run
# savecore to check the swap partition for a dump;  this is run in the
# foreground to reduce the chances of overwriting the dump.
#
# This does not apply for zfs root systems that use a zvol for dump;
# for such systems the dedicated dump device is appointed during startup
# of the filesystem/usr:default instance before any swap is added.
# Therefore we must check that the dump device is a swap device here -
# if not then we'll run savecore here in the foreground and prevent
# our dependent services coming online until we're done.
