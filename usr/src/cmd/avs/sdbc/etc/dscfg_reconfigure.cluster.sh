# NWS DataServices within SunCluster reconfiguration script.
#
# Description:
#
# This script is called from /usr/cluster/lib/sc/run_reserve at
# appropriate times to start and stop the NWS DataServices as SunCluster
# disk device groups are brought online or taken offline.
#
# SNDR configuration requires that a resource group to be configured.
# 1. The resource group name should be same as device group name with -stor-rg
#    added. e.g. if device group name is abc-dg then resource group name
#    would be abc-dg-stor-rg. 
# 2. It should have 2 resources in it, unless one of the resource types is the
#    SUNW.GeoCtlAVS. One of type SUNW.LogicalHostname and either SUNW.HAStorage
#    or SUNW.HAStoragePlus types. Resource type versioning is ignored.
#    HAStorage type resource, should have ServicePaths property set to
#    device group name. HAStoragePlus type resource, should have either the
#    FilesystemMountPoints pointing to a files system associated with the
#    device group name, or GlobalDevicePaths property set to device group name.
#    LogicalHostname type resource should have a failoverIP address in it and
#    it will be used by SNDR to communicate with the secondary side.
#
# As SNDR requires that the LogicalHost (failover) IP address which is a
# part of resource group for SNDR, to be hosted on the same node where the 
# device group is, it tries to move the resource group also alongwith the
# device group, in become_primary case of run_reserve script. While
# in primary_to_secondary case, it will try to kill the switchover function
# if it is still running in background, after stopping NWS data services.
# 
# Usage:
#
# /usr/cluster/sbin/dscfg_reconfigure { start | stop } diskgroup
#
# Configuration:
#
# Scripts to be run should have been symlinked into $NWS_START_DIR and
# $NWS_STOP_DIR.  Note that the scripts are processed in lexical order,
# and that unlike /etc/rc?.d/ there is no leading S or K character.
#
# Exit status:
#
# 0 - success
# 1 - error

# This function calls switchfunc function in background, to switch the 
# resource group for SNDR. It validates the diskgroup/diskset is configured 
# for SNDR, checks if the resource group is in Managed state etc.
# If it detects a mis-configuration, it will disable SNDR for the
# device group being processed. This is to prevent cluster hangs and panics.
#  
# The ServicePaths extension property of HAStorage type resource or the
# GlobalDevicePaths extension property of HAStoragePlus, both of which
# specify the device group, serve as a link or mapping to retrieve the 
# resource group associated with the SNDR configured device group.
# Switchfunc is called in the background to avoid the deadlock situation arising
# out of switchover of resource group from within device group switchover.
#
# In run_reserve context, we are doing the device group switchover, trying to
# bring it online on the node. Device group is not completely switched online,
# until the calling script run_reserve returns. In the process, we are calling
# the associated SNDR resource group switchover using scswitch command. 
# Resource group switchover will trigger the switchover of device group also. 
#
# If resource group switchover is called in foreground, before the device 
# group has become online, then it will result in switching the device group 
# again, resulting in deadlock. Resource group can not become online until 
# the device group is online and the device group can not become online until the 
# script returns, causing this circular dependency resulting in deadlock. 
#
# Calling the resource group switch in background allows current run_reserve
# script to return immediately, allowing device group to become online.
# If the device group is already online on the node, then the resource group 
# does not cause the device group switchover again.

# Output: 0 - success
