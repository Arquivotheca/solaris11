# The Logical Domains agents service is enabled by default on sun4v platforms.
# However it can fail to start if the domain has a machine description in which
# the vlds node is not defined (because it has an old MD or firmware). So we
# check if a vlds device is effectively defined. If not then we disable the
# service for this session. We don't return an error so that the service does
# not go into the maintenance state and generate spurious error (especially if
# the system is not configured with LDoms). The service is not permanently
# disabled so that the service can come up if the domain is restarted with a
# compatible MD.
