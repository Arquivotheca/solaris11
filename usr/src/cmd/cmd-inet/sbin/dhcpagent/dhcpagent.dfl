# This file contains tunable parameters for dhcpagent(1M).
#

# All parameters can be tuned for a specific interface by prepending
# the interface name to the parameter name.  For example, to make
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY happen on all interfaces except hme0, specify:
#
# hme0.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes
#
# An interface name alone specifies IPv4 DHCP.  For DHCPv6, append ".v6".
# Some examples:
#
# hme0.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		specify hme0 v4 behavior
# hme0.v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no	specify hme0 v6 behavior
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		match all v4 interfaces
# .v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		match all v6 interfaces

# By default, when the DHCP agent is sent a SIGTERM (typically when
# the system is shut down), all managed addresses are dropped rather
# than released.  Dropping an address does not notify the DHCP server
# that the address is no longer in use, leaving it possibly available
# for subsequent use by the same client.  If DHCP is later restarted
# on the interface, the client will ask the server if it can continue
# to use the address.  If the server either grants the request, or
# does not answer (and the lease has not yet expired), then the client
# will use the original address.
#
# Similarly, when the system is suspended and then woken up or when
# the link status transitions from down to up, DHCP will ask the server
# to continue to use the managed address, in case the lease has changed.
#
# By uncommenting the following parameter-value pairs, all managed
# addresses are released on SIGTERM instead, and any that may have been
# saved but cannot be verified will not be used.  When SIGTERM is
# received, the DHCP server is notified that the address is available
# for use, and the address will not be saved for a later restart.  If
# DHCP receives SIGTHAW or a link-up event, DHCP will attempt to verify
# the previous lease, but if unable to do so, it will not attempt to
# use that lease.  This behavior is often preferred for roaming systems.
#
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes
# .v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes

# By default, the DHCP agent waits 3 seconds to collect OFFER
# responses to a DISCOVER.  If it receives no OFFERs in this time, it
# then waits for another 3 seconds, and so forth.  To change this
# behavior, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note: this does not control the retransmission strategy for
# DISCOVERs, which is formally specified in RFC 2131.  This parameter
# is specified in seconds.
#
# OFFER_WAIT=

# By default, the DHCP agent does not send out a client identifier
# (and hence, the chaddr field is used by the DHCP server as the
# client identifier.)  To make the DHCP agent send a client
# identifier, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note that by default this is treated as an NVT ASCII string.  To
# specify a binary value, prepend "0x" to a sequence of hexadecimal
# digits (for example, the value 0xAABBCC11 would set the client
# identifier to the 4-byte binary sequence 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0x11).
#
# CLIENT_ID=

# By default, the DHCP agent will try to request the hostname currently
# associated with the interface performing DHCP.  If this option is
# enabled, the agent will attempt to find a host name in /etc/hostname.<if>,
# which must contain a line of the form
#
#	inet name
#
# where "name" is a single RFC 1101-compliant token.  If found, the token
# will be used to request that host name from the DHCP server.  To prevent
# this, uncomment the following line.
#
# REQUEST_HOSTNAME=no

# By default, a parameter request list requesting a subnet mask (1),
# router (3), DNS server (6), hostname (12), DNS domain (15), broadcast
# address (28), and encapsulated vendor options (43), is sent to the DHCP
# server when the DHCP agent sends requests.  However, if desired, this
# can be changed by altering the following parameter-value pair.  The
# numbers correspond to the values defined in the IANA bootp-dhcp-parameters
# registry at the time of this writing.  Site and standard option names from
# /etc/dhcp/inittab are also accepted.
#
PARAM_REQUEST_LIST=1,3,6,12,15,28,43

# The default DHCPv6 parameter request list has preference (7), unicast (12),
# DNS addresses (23), DNS search list (24), NIS addresses (27), and
# NIS domain (29).  This may be changed by altering the following parameter-
# value pair.  The numbers correspond to the values defined in the IANA
# dhcpv6-parameters registry at the time of this writing.  Site and standard
# option names from /etc/dhcp/inittab6 are also accepted.
.v6.PARAM_REQUEST_LIST=7,12,23,24,27,29

# The parameter ignore list allows you to instruct the DHCP client to discard
# optional parameters received from the DHCP server.  The format is the same
# as the request list above.  When discarded, a parameter will not be acted
# on by the DHCP client or returned to users via the dhcpinfo(1) command.
