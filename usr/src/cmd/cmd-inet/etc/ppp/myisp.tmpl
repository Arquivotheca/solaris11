# This is an example configuration for dialing into a typical ISP from a
# single node.  To use this example, uncomment the last line of the
# pap-secrets file and rename the template files:
#
#	mv /etc/ppp/options.tmpl /etc/ppp/options
#	mv /etc/ppp/options.ttya.tmpl /etc/ppp/options.ttya
#	mv /etc/ppp/myisp-chat.tmpl /etc/ppp/myisp-chat
#	mv /etc/ppp/peers/myisp.tmpl /etc/ppp/peers/myisp
#
# and invoke with:
#
#	pppd ttya call myisp
#
# Options in this file, /etc/ppp/options, /etc/ppp//options.<tty>,
# /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets are all considered
# privileged.  Those from ~/.ppprc and the command line are privileged
# if the invoker is root, and unprivileged otherwise.
#
connect "/usr/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/myisp-chat"	# dial into ISP
user myname		# my account name at my ISP
remotename myisp	# name of the ISP; for pap-secrets
noauth			# do not authenticate the ISP's identity (client)
noipdefault		# assume no IP address; get it from ISP
defaultroute		# install default route; ISP is Internet gateway
updetach		# log errors and CONNECT string to invoker
noccp			# ISP doesn't support free compression
