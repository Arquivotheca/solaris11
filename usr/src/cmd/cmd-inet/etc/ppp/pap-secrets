# Passwords for authentication using PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)
# are placed here.  Each line is a separate entry and consists of a list of
# space or tab separated tokens.
#
#	client	server	password	[IP addresses ["--" options]]
#
# When authenticating to a peer (so-called "client mode;" as when dialing
# out to an ISP), the "client" will be matched using the local name and
# "server" will use the remote peer's name.  PAP does not specify an
# authenticator name, so the "remotename <name>" option should be used.
# Typically, the "user <name>" option is also to specify the local name.
#
# When authenticating a peer (so-called "server mode;" as when allowing
# dial-up access to this system), the remote peer's name is the "client"
# and the local system name is the "server."  In this case, the privileged
# "name <name>" option is sometimes used to set the local name.  The "user
# <name>" option cannot be used.  The remote peer's name comes from the PAP
# messages the peer sends.
#
# After the password, which may be a crypt(3c) encoded password when acting
# as a server, a list of valid IP addresses for the peer appears.  This
# must be present when acting as a server.  Usually, this is specified as
# "*" and actual IP addresses are given in the options.  If a given dial-in
# peer has an allocated IP address ("static IP addressing"), then this
# address may be given here.  If there's exactly one address, then this will
# be sent to the peer as a hint.
#
# The entry may also have extra options after a -- token.  These are
# interpreted as privileged pppd options, and may be used to enable
# proxyarp or other optional features.
#
# This is provided for the "myisp" example; see peers/myisp.tmpl.
