# TCP_STRONG_ISS sets the TCP initial sequence number generation parameters.
# Set TCP_STRONG_ISS to be:
#	0 = Old-fashioned sequential initial sequence number generation.
#	1 = Improved sequential generation, with random variance in increment.
#	2 = RFC 1948 sequence number generation, unique-per-connection-ID.

# ACCEPT6TO4RELAY sets the policy for 6to4 tunnels communicating with 6to4
# Relay Routers as defined in RFC 3056.  Traffic sent from a 6to4 site to a
# native IPv6 host will be tunneled over the IPv4 Internet to a 6to4 Relay
# Router before being delivered to the native IPv6 host.  Enabling support
# for sending/receiving traffic to/from a 6to4 Relay Router can create a
# security risk for a 6to4 site, since there is no default trust
# mechanism for communicating with Relay Routers.  Communication support
# with 6to4 Relay Routers has been disabled by default.  ACCEPT6TO4RELAY
# can be set to the following values:
#	NO = Disables communication with 6to4 Relay Routers
#	YES = Enables communication with 6to4 Relay Routers and thus native
#	    IPv6 hosts through a 6to4 tunnel.
#
# When ACCEPT6TO4RELAY=YES, RELAY6TO4ADDR will be used to determine the
# destination IPv4 address to be used as a tunnel endpoint when communicating
# with 6to4 Relay Routers.  192.88.99.1 is the well-known 6to4 Relay Router
# Anycast address as defined in RFC 3068.  This value may be changed to
# the IPv4 unicast address of a particular 6to4 Relay Router, if desired.
#
ACCEPT6TO4RELAY=NO
RELAY6TO4ADDR="192.88.99.1"
