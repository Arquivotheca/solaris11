# Legacy configuration file for inetd(1M).  See inetd.conf(4).
#
# This file is no longer directly used to configure inetd.
# The Solaris services which were formerly configured using this file
# are now configured in the Service Management Facility (see smf(5))
# using inetadm(1M).
#
# Any records remaining in this file after installation or upgrade,
# or later created by installing additional software, must be converted
# to smf(5) services and imported into the smf repository using
# inetconv(1M), otherwise the service will not be available.  Once
# a service has been converted using inetconv, further changes made to
# its entry here are not reflected in the service.
