# Ping uses the ancillary data feature which is available only through
# UNIX 98 standards version of Socket interface. This interface is supposed to
# be accessed by -lxnet. We used to add -lsocket and -lnsl to capture new
# not-yet-standard interfaces, but -lnsl is no longer necessary.
#
# Someday -lxnet alone should be enough when IPv6 inspired new interfaces
# are part of standards.
LDLIBS +=	-lxnet -lsocket -lm -linetutil

# These #defines are required to use UNIX 98 interfaces
CPPFLAGS += -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 -D__EXTENSIONS__

# Setting the above defines to use the UNIX98 ancillary data feature
# causes lint to output warnings about lint library declarations conflicting
# with those in the header files. Since we need these features the best
# course of action is to switch the types of the resulting warnings off
# when running lint.
