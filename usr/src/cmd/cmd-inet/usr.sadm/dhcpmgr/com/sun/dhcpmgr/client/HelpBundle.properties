# Resources for locating the correct help file for a particular window
# 
# L10N instructions
# -----------------
# Each line of this file is of the form:
#
# key=value
#
# The key portion must not be localized, as it is a constant in the program.
# The value portion should be modified appropriately for each locale to point
# to the location of the localized version of the html file relative to the
# directory:
# 
# /usr/share/lib/locale/com/sun/dhcpmgr/client/help
#
# So that for the "de" locale the first entry in this file should look like:
#
# create_address=de/dhcp_addr_create.html
#
# resulting in that help file being located at:
#
# /usr/share/lib/locale/com/sun/dhcpmgr/client/help/de/dhcp_addr_create.html
#
# And the corresponding name of THIS file would be:
#
# /usr/share/lib/locale/com/sun/dhcpmgr/client/HelpBundle_de.properties
#
# At the present time it is a requirement that the above convention be followed
# with respect to the relative path name as the l10n code in HelpIds.java
# uses the presence of a '/' in the value as the indicator of whether a
# localized instance of this file is being used.  See bug 4177489 if you
# want to understand why this is so.
