To fix #1098866, the directory structure is modified.
This directory contains machine independent source codes of csh.
Two files are currently machine dependent. These are
	signal.c and signal.h
Machine dependent files are moved under $(MACH) directory.

So, if you are going to port csh for other architecture,
you have to do:
	1) create a directory for the new architecture.
		(Say, intel)

	2) create following files. 
	   (You can use sparc/{Makefile, signal.c, signal.h} as templates.
		intel/Makefile
		intel/signal.c
			You need to modify sigvechandler()
		intel/signal.h
			You need to modify struct sigcontext.

In future, I am planning to rewrite csh so it uses modern
signal interface so csh will not have any machine dependent
portion.

usr/src/cmd/csh/SCCS/{s.signal.c, s.signal.h} are move under
usr/src/cmd/csh/sparc/SCCS. So, if you wish to see sccs histories
of signal.c and signal.h, please refer to usr/src/cmd/csh/sparc/SCCS.
