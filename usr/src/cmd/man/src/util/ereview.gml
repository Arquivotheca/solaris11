The following declarations may be referred to using a public entity as
follows:

<!ENTITY % ereview PUBLIC "-//USA-DOD//DTD SUP MIL-M-28001B EREVIEW//EN">

-->

<!-- The %mrinfo entity is required for support of the electronic review
declaration set.  Note that this entity matches an identical set of elements
in the base document being reviewed, and may therefore require tailoring
accordingly.  For documents conforming to the Template Doctype for Technical
Documents contained in Appendix A of this specification, the %mrinfo entity is
declared as follows:

<!ENTITY   % mrinfo     "(pubno+, (revnum|(chgnum, chgdate)|pubdate))" >

-->

<!-- The %mrtext entity indicates what elements from the base DTD can occur in
the "textual" (i.e., mrpara and mritem) elements in a modreq.  For documents
conforming to the Template Doctype for Technical Documents contained in
Appendix A of this specification, the %mrtext entity is declared as follows:

<!ENTITY % mrtext       "#PCDATA | symbol" >

-->

<!-- The %mrelems entity indicates what elements from the base DTD can occur
along with the mrpara and mrlist elements (e.g., within mrreason, mrinstr,
mrgenmod, and mrrespns) in a modreq.  For documents conforming to the Template
Doctype for Technical Documents contained in Appendix A of this specification,
the %mrelems entity is declared as follows:

<!ENTITY %  mrelems     "| graphic" >

-->



<!-- Generic default definitions of %mrinfo, %mrtext, and %mrelems are given
below.  These are to be replaced by a definition appropriate to the document
being reviewed: -->
