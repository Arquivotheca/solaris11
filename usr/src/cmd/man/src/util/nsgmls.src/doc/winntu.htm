<H1>Notes on SP Unicode support under Windows NT</H1>
<P>
When compiled with the appropriate preprocessor definition
(<CODE>UNICODE</CODE>), SP now uses Unicode interfaces to NT.  This
means that the <SAMP>SP_BCTF</SAMP> environment variable applies only
to file input and output, and so <CODE>unicode</CODE> is allowed as
the value of <SAMP>SP_BCTF</SAMP>.
<P>
In order for non-ASCII characters to be correctly displayed on your
console you must select a TrueType font, such as Lucida Console, as your
console font.
<P>
If you define your own public character sets, you should use Unicode
(or a superset of Unicode) as your universal character set.
<P>
The following additional BCTFs are supported:
<DL>
<DT>
<SAMP>windows</SAMP>
<DD>
Specify this BCTF when a storage object is encoded using your
system's default Windows character set, and your document character
set is declared as Unicode.  This uses the so-called ANSI code page.
<DT>
<SAMP>wunicode</SAMP>
<DD>
This uses the <SAMP>unicode</SAMP> BCTF if the storage object starts
with a byte order mark and otherwise the <SAMP>windows</SAMP> BCTF.
If you are working with Unicode, this is probably the best value
for <SAMP>SP_BCTF</SAMP>.
<DT>
<SAMP>ms-dos</SAMP>
<DD>
Specify this BCTF when a storage object (file) uses the OEM code page,
and your document character set is declared as Unicode.
The OEM code-page for a particular
machine is the code-page used by FAT file-systems on that machine and
is the default code-page for MS-DOS consoles.
