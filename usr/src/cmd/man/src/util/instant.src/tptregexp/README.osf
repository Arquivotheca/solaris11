OSF did not write this code.

Changes made:

    Renamed "regexp.h" to "tptregexp.h" to avoid conflicts with systems that
    have a /usr/include/regexp.h.  Changed the *.c files in the appropriate
    places.

    Renamed these routines:
	regcomp()  -> tpt_regcomp()
	regexec()  -> tpt_regexec()
	regsub()   -> tpt_regsub()
	regerror() -> tpt_regerror()
    This is to avoid conflicts in the standard C library.

    In Makefile - wrote "all" and "install" targets.  Changed "regexp.h"
    to "tptregexp.h", as appropriate.

    In regexp.c - added #include <string.h> to keep compiler happy.
