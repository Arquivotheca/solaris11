/*
 * ckinode() essentially traverses the blocklist of the provided
 * inode.  For each block either the caller-supplied callback (id_func
 * in the provided struct inodesc) or dirscan() is invoked.  Which is
 * chosen is controlled by what type of traversal was requested
 * (id_type) - if it was for an ADDR or ACL, use the callback,
 * otherwise it is assumed to be DATA (i.e., a directory) whose
 * contents need to be scanned.
 *
 * Note that a directory inode can get passed in with a type of ADDR;
 * the type field is orthogonal to the IFMT value.  This is so that
 * the file aspects (no duplicate blocks, etc) of a directory can be
 * verified just like is done for any other file, or the actual
 * contents can be scanned so that connectivity and such can be
 * investigated.
 *
 * The traversal is controlled by flags in the return value of
 * dirscan() or the callback.  Five flags are defined, STOP, SKIP,
 * KEEPON, ALTERED, and FOUND.  Their semantics are:
 *
 *     STOP -    no further processing of this inode is desired/possible/
 *               feasible/etc.  This can mean that whatever the scan
 *               was searching for was found, or a serious
 *               inconsistency was encountered, or anything else
 *               appropriate.
 *
 *     SKIP -    something that made it impossible to continue was
 *               encountered, and the caller should go on to the next
 *               inode.  This is more for i/o failures than for
 *               logical inconsistencies.  Nothing actually looks for
 *               this.
 *
 *     KEEPON -  no more blocks of this inode need to be scanned, but
 *               nothing's wrong, so keep on going with the next
 *               inode.  It is similar to STOP, except that
 *               ckinode()'s caller will typically advance to the next
 *               inode for KEEPON, whereas it ceases scanning through
 *               the inodes completely for STOP.
 *
 *     ALTERED - a change was made to the inode.  If the caller sees
 *               this set, it should make sure to flush out the
 *               changes.  Note that any data blocks read in by the
 *               function need to be marked dirty by it directly;
 *               flushing of those will happen automatically later.
 *
 *     FOUND -   whatever was being searched for was located.
 *               Typically combined with STOP to avoid wasting time
 *               doing additional looking.
 *
 * During a traversal, some state needs to be carried around.  At the
 * least, the callback functions need to know what inode they're
 * working on, which logical block, and whether or not fixing problems
 * when they're encountered is desired.  Rather than try to guess what
 * else might be needed (and thus end up passing way more arguments
 * than is reasonable), all the possibilities have been bundled in
 * struct inodesc.  About half of the fields are specific to directory
 * traversals, and the rest are pretty much generic to any traversal.
 *
 * The general fields are:
 *
 *     id_fix        What to do when an error is found.  Generally, this
 *                   is set to DONTKNOW before a traversal.  If a
 *                   problem is encountered, it is changed to either FIX
 *                   or NOFIX by the dofix() query function.  If id_fix
 *                   has already been set to FIX when dofix() is called, then
 *                   it includes the ALTERED flag (see above) in its return
 *                   value; the net effect is that the inode's buffer
 *                   will get marked dirty and written to disk at some
 *                   point.  If id_fix is DONTKNOW, then dofix() will
 *                   query the user.  If it is NOFIX, then dofix()
 *                   essentially does nothing.  A few routines set NOFIX
 *                   as the initial value, as they are performing a best-
 *                   effort informational task, rather than an actual
 *                   repair operation.
 *
 *     id_func       This is the function that will be called for every
 *                   logical block in the file (assuming id_type is not
 *                   DATA).  The logical block may represent a hole, so
 *                   the callback needs to be prepared to handle that
 *                   case.  Its return value is a combination of the flags
 *                   described above (SKIP, ALTERED, etc).
 *
 *     id_number     The inode number whose block list or data is being
 *                   scanned.
 *
 *     id_parent     When id_type is DATA, this is the inode number for
 *                   the parent of id_number.  Otherwise, it is
 *                   available for use as an extra parameter or return
 *                   value between the callback and ckinode()'s caller.
 *                   Which, if either, of those is left completely up to
 *                   the two routines involved, so nothing can generally
 *                   be assumed about the id_parent value for non-DATA
 *                   traversals.
 *
 *     id_lbn        This is the current logical block (not fragment)
 *                   number being visited by the traversal.
 *
 *     id_blkno      This is the physical block corresponding to id_lbn.
 *
 *     id_numfrags   This defines how large a block is being processed in
 *                   this particular invocation of the callback.
 *                   Usually, it will be the same as sblock.fs_frag.
 *                   However, if a direct block is being processed and
 *                   it is less than a full filesystem block,
 *                   id_numfrags will indicate just how many fragments
 *                   (starting from id_lbn) are actually part of the
 *                   file.
 *
 *     id_truncto    The pass 4 callback is used in several places to
 *                   free the blocks of a file (the `FILE HAS PROBLEM
 *                   FOO; CLEAR?' scenario).  This has been generalized
 *                   to allow truncating a file to a particular length
 *                   rather than always completely discarding it.  If
 *                   id_truncto is -1, then the entire file is released,
 *                   otherwise it is logical block number to truncate
 *                   to.  This generalized interface was motivated by a
 *                   desire to be able to discard everything after a
 *                   hole in a directory, rather than the entire
 *                   directory.
 *
 *     id_type       Selects the type of traversal.  DATA for dirscan(),
 *                   ADDR or ACL for using the provided callback.
 *
 * There are several more fields used just for dirscan() traversals:
 *
 *     id_filesize   The number of bytes in the overall directory left to
 *                   process.
 *
 *     id_loc        Byte position within the directory block.  Should always
 *                   point to the start of a directory entry.
 *
 *     id_entryno    Which logical directory entry is being processed (0
 *                   is `.', 1 is `..', 2 and on are normal entries).
 *                   This field is primarily used to enable special
 *                   checks when looking at the first two entries.
 *
 *                   The exception (there's always an exception in fsck)
 *                   is that in pass 1, it tracks how many fragments are
 *                   being used by a particular inode.
 *
 *     id_firsthole  The first logical block number that was found to
 *                   be zero.  As directories are not supposed to have
 *                   holes, this marks where a directory should be
 *                   truncated down to.  A value of -1 indicates that
 *                   no holes were found.
 *
 *     id_dirp       A pointer to the in-memory copy of the current
 *                   directory entry (as identified by id_loc).
 *
 *     id_name       This is a directory entry name to either create
 *                   (callback is mkentry) or locate (callback is
 *                   chgino, findino, or findname).
