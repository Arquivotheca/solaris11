<!--
	The devfsadm service is dependent on the sysevent service
	inasmuch as receiving an event is subordinate to event transport
	itself, and a devfsadm failure doesn't affect unrelated
	sysevent activity.  Devfsadm as a daemon is not needed for
	already configured devices per se but provides support for
	on-demand configuration of new devices via interfaces such
	as di_devlink_init() provided by libdevinfo, and as such,
	depends on sysevent.
