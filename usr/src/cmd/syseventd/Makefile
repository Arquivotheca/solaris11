# cmd/syseventd/Makefile
#

#
#  The syseventd source is organized in a two-level hierarchy,
#  with the top level for daemons and modules.  Daemons (cmds)
#  need to be built with the usr/src/cmd hierarchy of Makefiles
#  for the proper set of cc flags etc., whereas loadable modules
#  need usr/src/lib.  Each bottom-level Makefile includes
#  the relevant set of common Makefiles (for daemons or modules),
#  and also inherit the upper level set of common Makefiles
#  for all syseventd components.
