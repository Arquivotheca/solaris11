# Map <product-id>.<chassis-id> to an <alias-id>.
#
# This file is used to associate a chassis, like a storage JBOD, with an alias
# that describes some environment-specific aspect of the chassis. We recommend
# an <alias-id> scheme that identifys chassis physical location -- like a
# specific RACK and Unumber range.
#
# Aliases are administered via fmadm(1M) alias subcommands, like
#
#	fmadm add-alias SUN-Storage-J4400.0904QAK00E RACK29.U33-36 'comment'
#
# The /dev/chassis directory contains <product-id>.<chassis-id> directories
# for things that don't yet have an <alias-id>, and <alias-id> symlinks for
# chassis that have nicknames.
