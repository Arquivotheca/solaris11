This is the Solaris ON port of ntfsprogs v2.0.0
Please see http://www.linux-ntfs.org/ for more information.

ntfsprogs has been broken into two pieces: src/lib/libntfs and src/cmd/ntfsprogs

The Makefiles have all been replaced by ON Makefiles.

This directory contains the necessary contents of ntfsprogs-2.0.0/ntfsprogs
ntfsmount is missing until FUSE has been integrated into ON.
