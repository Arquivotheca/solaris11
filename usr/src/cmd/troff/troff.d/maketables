# For use in one of the dev* font-table directories
#
#    If you're not really comfortable with the 'makedev' program, you can
# use this shell script to make the binary font and device tables for the
# device independent troff. You can be sure that all the necessary
# binary files will be properly updated. The command 'maketables *'
# will make a complete new set of binary '.out' files.
#
#    If the makedev program isn't located in the parent of this directory,
# just change the initialization of the shell variable MAKEDEV.
#
#
# USAGE:  maketables files
#         files - one or more files from this directory.
#
