/*
 * Section Ordering History/Background:
 *
 * There are two forms of section ordering, SHF_ORDERED, and SHF_LINK_ORDER.
 *
 * SHF_ORDERED was invented at Sun in order to support the PowerPC port
 * of Solaris 2.6, which used it for sorting tag words which describe
 * the state of callee saves registers for given PC ranges. It was defined
 * in the OS specific ELF section flag range. Some other values were defined
 * at the same time:
 *	SHF_EXCLUDE - Section is to be excluded from executables or shared
 *		objects, and only kept in relocatable object output.
 *	SHN_BEFORE/SHN_AFTER - Sections are placed before/after all other
 *		sections, in the order they are encountered by the linker.
 * Although initially conceived to support the PowerPC, the functionality
 * was implemented for all platforms, and was later used to manage C++
 * exceptions and stack unwinding. The PowerPC port was discontinued after
 * one release, but SHF_ORDERED lives on.
 *
 * SHF_LINK_ORDER was invented later by the wider ELF community, and is
 * therefore assigned a value in the generic ELF section flag range. It is
 * essentially a simpler version of SHF_ORDERED, dispensing with some
 * unnecessary features. The Solaris implementation of SHF_LINK_ORDER uses
 * SHF_EXCLUDE, and SHF_BEFORE/SHN_AFTER as well, but it appears that these
 * are still Solaris-only extensions not used by other implementations.
 * SHF_LINK_ORDER has superseded SHF_ORDERED. The older mechanism is
 * supported for the benefit of old pre-existing objects.
 *
 * -----
 *
 * SHF_ORDERED offers two distinct and separate abilities:
 *
 *	(1) To specify the output section
 *	(2) To optionally be sorted relative to other sorted sections,
 *		using a non-sorted section as a sort key.
 *
 * To  do this, it uses both the sh_link, and sh_info fields:
 *
 *    sh_link
 *	Specifies the output section to receive this input section.
 *	The sh_link field of an SHF_ORDERED section forms a linked list of
 *	sections, all of which must have identical section header flags
 *	(including SHF_ORDERED). The list is terminated by a final section
 *	with a sh_link that points at itself. All input sections in this list
 *	are assigned to the output section of the final section in the list.
 *	Hence, if a section points at itself, the effect is that it gets
 *	assigned to an output section in the usual default manner (i.e. an
 *	output section with the same name as the input). However, it can
 *	point at any arbitrary other section. This is a way to put a section
 *	with one name into an output section with a different name. It should
 *	be noted that this is of little value overall, because the link-editor
 *	already supports a more general feature for directing input sections
 *	to output sections: An input section named .text%foo will be sent to
 *	an output section named ".text", and this works for all sections,
 *	not just ordered ones.
 *
 *    sh_info
 *	If sh_info is in the range (1 <= value < shnum), then this input section
 *	is added to the group of sorted sections. The section referenced by
 *	sh_info must be unsorted, and is used as the sort key.
 *
 *	If sh_info is SHN_BEFORE or SHN_AFTER, it is put in the pre/post group,
 *	in the order it arrives (the before/after classes are not sorted).
 *
 *	If sh_info is "invalid" (typically 0), then this section is added to
 *	the group of non-sorted sections, and goes into the output file in the
 *	order it arrives. This is not a valuable feature, as the same effect
 *	can be achieved more simply by not setting SHF_ORDERED at all.
 *
 * SHF_LINK_ORDER is a simplification of SHF_ORDERED. It uses sh_link to specify
 * the section to use as a sort key and sh_info is set to 0. The standard
 * ".text%foo" mechanism is used to direct input sections to output sections,
 * and unordered sections indicate that by not setting SHF_LINK_ORDER.
