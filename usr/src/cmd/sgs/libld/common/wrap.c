 * GNU ld --wrap support, also known as -z wrap.
 *
 * We maintain an AVL tree of wrapped symbol names. Every undefined
 * symbol is tested against this tree, and those that match have
 * their names modified to produce the wrapping effect:
 *
 * -	An undefined reference to XXX is converted to __wrap_XXX
 * -	An undefined reference to __real_XXX is converted to XXX
 *
 * This operation has a cost, but that is mitigated by two factors:
 *
 * -	This is a test feature, not used for production code, so somewhat
 *	longer link times are tolerable.
 * -	The cost of this feature is only paid when it is used. Otherwise,
 *	the sole overhead is the cost of testing the NULL AVL tree pointer
 *	during symbol processing.
