/*
 * Archive members are typically extracted to resolve an existing undefined
 * reference.  However, other symbol definitions can cause archive members to
 * be processed to determine if the archive member provides a more appropriate
 * definition.  This routine processes the archive member to determine if the
 * member is really required.
 *
 *  i.	Tentative symbols may cause the extraction of an archive member.
 *	If the archive member has a strong defined symbol it will be used.
 *	If the archive member simply contains another tentative definition,
 *	or a defined function symbol, then it will not be used.
 *
 *  ii.	A symbol reference may define a hidden or protected visibility.  The
 *	reference can only be bound to a definition within a relocatable object
 *	for this restricted visibility to be satisfied.  If the archive member
 * 	provides a definition of the same symbol type, this definition is
 *	taken.  The visibility of the defined symbol is irrelevant, as the most
 *	restrictive visibility of the reference and the definition will be
 *	applied to the final symbol.
 *
 * exit:
 *	Returns 1 if there is a match, 0 if no match is seen, and S_ERROR if an
