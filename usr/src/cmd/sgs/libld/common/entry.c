/*
 * The link-editor uses a segment descriptor list to describe the program
 * headers, and related output segments, it can potentially create. This
 * list is initially seeded using the templates contained in the sg_desc
 * array below. Additional segments may be added using a mapfile.
 *
 * The entries in sg_desc must be put in the order defined by the
 * Segment_id enum.
 *
 * The entries in sg_desc are initialized using the SG_DESC_INIT macro
 * for two reasons:
 *
 *	1) The first field of the Sg_desc struct is a program header
 *		entry. ELF32_Phdr and ELF64_Phdr have the same fields,
 *		but their order is different. Use of a macro allows us
 *		to handle this transparently.
 *	2) Most of the fields in the Sg_desc entries are set to 0.
 *		Use of a macro allows us to hide the clutter.
 *
 * If a given program header can be referenced via an entrance criteria
 * (i.e. can serve as a segment), then it must be given a unique sg_name.
 * Program headers that cannot be a segment (PHDR, INTERP, DYNAMIC, etc)
 * must have a NULL sg_name --- their program header type identifies them.

 * The C language guarantees that a structure containing only fields of
 * identical type is indistinguishable from a simple array containing
 * the same number of items of the same type. They will have the same
 * size, alignment, and internal layout:
 *
 * -	A pointer to one is equivalent to a pointer to the other, and you
 *	can cast safely between them.
 *
 * -	You can put both into a union, and access the elements within
 *	either way (by index, or by name).
 *
 * We use this fact here to create an "array" of predefined segment
 * descriptors, assigning each one a mnemonic name that can be used to point
 * at it from a predefined entrance criteria descriptor (below). These
 * segments are positioned in the default order that will result in the
 * output object, unless a mapfile alters things.
