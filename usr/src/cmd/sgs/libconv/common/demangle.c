/*
 * Demangle C++ symbols.
 *
 * This routine acts as a generic routine for use by liblddbg (and hence tools
 * like elfdump(1) and pvs(1)), ld(1) and ld.so.1(1).
 *
 * The C++ ABI-2 places no limits on symbol names, thus when demangling a name
 * it's possible the buffer won't be big enough (DEMANGLE_ESPACE) so here we
 * try to allocate bigger buffers.  However, we place a limit on this buffer
 * size for fear of a C++ error sending us into an infinit loop.
 *
 * NOTE. we create and use a common buffer for use by cplus_demangle(), thus
 * each call to this routine will override the contents of any existing call.
 * Normally this is sufficient for typical error diagnostics referencing one
 * symbol.  For those diagnostics using more than one symbol name, all but the
 * last name must be copied to a temporary buffer (regardless of whether
 * demangling occurred, as the process of attempting to demangle may damage the
 * buffer).  One model is:
 *
 *	if ((_name1 = demangle(name1)) != name1) {
 *		char *	__name1 = strdupa(_name1);
 *		name1 = (const char *)__name1;
 *	}
 *	name2 = demangle(name2);
 *	eprintf(format, name1, name2);
