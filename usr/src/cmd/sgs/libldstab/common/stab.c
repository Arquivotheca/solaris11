/*
 * The shared object /usr/lib/libldstab.so.1 is a link-editor
 * support library that was used to compress the stab table by
 * eliminating duplicate include file entries. The link-editor would
 * load it by default, unless the user explicitly supplied a support
 * library via the ld -S option. We publically documented this in the
 * Solaris Linkers and Libraries Manual (LLM), stating that users
 * who supply their own support libraries should also explicitly
 * add '-S libldstab.so.1' to their link commands in order to retain
 * the functionality it supplied.
 *
 * The original libldstab.so worked by forking a child process running
 * a program named sbfocus. sbfocus was delivered with the Sun
 * compilers, and was expected to be found in the users PATH.
 * As the compilers and the OSnet are delivered on disjoint schedules,
 * this division never worked very well. Modern versions of the
 * compilers supply their own support libraries directly as needed, and
 * no longer deliver a program named sbfocus. The link-editor no longer
 * loads libldstab.so.1 by default, and it is no longer documented in the LLM.
 *
 * The current version of /usr/lib/libldstab.so.1 is a stub that exists
 * solely for backward compatibility. In the case where an existing
 *  Makefile  still follows the old advice in the LLM and supplies
 * '-S libldstab.so.1' to the link-editor command line, this object
 * will be loaded. It specifies a support library version of
 * LD_SUP_VNONE, which indicates to the link-editor that it is
 * not needed and should be quietly unloaded. In this way, we
 * preserve the old documented interface without undue overhead.
