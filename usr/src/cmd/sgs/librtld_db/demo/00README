This directory contains source code to the rdb debugger.  This debugger
is distributed as an example client of the librtld_db.so.1 interface.
As well as offering examples of the proper calling sequence for the
librtld_db.so.1 interface rdb also offers a sample implementation of the
proc_services (/usr/include/proc_service.h) that rdb is dependent upon.

The following is an overview of the directory structure and highlight
of some of the important files contained within:

rdb.man		- man page for the rdb debugger
Makefile.com
Makefile.targ	- common Makefiles included by ${MACH)/Makefile
common/*	- common source code used for all architectures
amd64/		- build directory contains architecture specific source files
i386/		 	"	"	"	"
sparc/			"	"	"	"
sparcv9/		"	"	"	"
amd64/Makefile	- makefiles to build rdb for each architecture
i386/Makefile		"	"	"	"
sparc/Makefil		"	"	"	"
sparcv9/Makefil		"	"	"	"
test/*		- sample command files which can be used to test rdb


Building rdb
------------

To build rdb:

 % cd {amd64,i386,sparc,sparcv9}	- depending on which architecture
					  you are building for
 % make all

To test the demo:

 % make test
