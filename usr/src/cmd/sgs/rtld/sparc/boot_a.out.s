/*
 * We got here because the initial call to a function resolved to a procedure
 * linkage table entry.  That entry did a branch to the first PLT entry, which
 * in turn did a call to aout_rtbndr (refer aout_plt_init()).
 *
 * the code sequence that got us here was:
 *
 * PLT entry for foo():
 *	save	%sp, -0x60, %sp			! patched first
 *	call	.PLT0				! patched second
 *	sethi	%hi(XXXXXXX), %g0		! unchanged
 *
 * Therefore on entry, %i7 has the address of the call, which will be added
 * to the offset to the plt entry in %g1 to calculate the plt entry address
 * we must also subtract 4 for because the address of PLT0 points to the
 * save instruction before the call
 *
 * the plt entry is rewritten:
 *
 * PLT entry for foo():
 *	sethi	%hi(entry_pt), %g1
 *	jmpl	%g1 + %lo(entry_pt), %g0
