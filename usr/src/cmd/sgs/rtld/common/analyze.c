 * Determine whether a search name matches one of the names associated with a
 * link-map.  A link-map contains several names:
 *
 *  -	a NAME() - this is the basename of the dynamic executable that started
 *	the process, and the path name of any dependencies used by the process.
 *	Most executables are received as full path names, as exec() prepends a
 *	search $PATH to locate the executable.  However, simple file names can
 *	be received from exec() if the file is executed from the present working
 *	directory.  Regardless, ld.so.1 maintains NAME() as the basename, as
 *	this has always been the name used in diagnostics and error messages.
 *	Most dependencies are full path names, as the typical search for a
 *	dependency, say "libx.so.1", results in search paths being prepended to
 *	the name, which eventually open "/lib/libx.so.1".  However, relative
 *	path names can be supplied as dependencies, e.g. dlopen("../libx.so.1").
 *
 *  -	a PATHNAME() - this is the fully resolved path name of the object.  This
 * 	name will differ from NAME() for all dynamic executables, and may differ
 *	from the NAME() of dependencies, if the dependency is not a full path
 * 	name, or the dependency resolves to a symbolic link.
 *
 *  -	an ALIAS() name - these are alternative names by which the object has
 *	been found, ie. when dependencies are loaded through a variety of
 *	different symbolic links.
 *
 * The name pattern matching can differ depending on whether we are looking
 * for a full path name (path != 0), or a simple file name (path == 0).  Full
 * path names typically match NAME() or PATHNAME() entries.
 *
 * For all full path name searches, the link-map names are taken as is.  For
 * simple file name searches, only the file name component of any link-map
 * names are used for comparison.

 * Files are opened by ld.so.1 to satisfy dependencies, filtees and dlopen()

 *
 *  -	does the path exist in the link-map lists FullPathNode AVL tree?  if
 *	so, the file is already loaded, and its associated link-map pointer
 *	is returned.
 *  -	does the path exist in the not-found AVL tree?  if so, this path has
 *	already been determined to not exist, and a failure is returned.
 *  -	a device/inode check, to ensure the same file isn't mapped multiple
 *	times through different paths.  See file_open().
 *
 * However, there are cases where a test for an existing file name needs to be
 * carried out, such as dlopen(NOLOAD) requests, dldump() requests, and as a
 * final fallback to dependency loading.  These requests are handled by
 * is_so_loaded().
 *
 * A traversal through the callers link-map list is carried out, and from each
 * link-map, a comparison is made against all of the various names by which the
 * object has been referenced.  is_so_matched() is used to compare the link-map
 * names against the name being searched for.  Whether the search name is a full
 * path name or a simple file name, governs what comparisons are made.
 *

 * character, or a relative path name that includes a "/" character, must match
 * the link-map names exactly.  A simple file name, which is any name *not*
