 * Implementation of all external interfaces between ld.so.1 and libc.
 *
 * This file started as a set of routines that provided synchronization and
 * locking operations using calls to libthread.  libthread has merged with libc
 * under the Unified Process Model (UPM), and things have gotten a lot simpler.
 * This file continues to establish and redirect various events within ld.so.1
 * to interfaces within libc.
 *
 * Until libc is loaded and relocated, any external interfaces are captured
 * locally.  Each link-map list maintains its own set of external vectors, as
 * each link-map list typically provides its own libc.  Although this per-link-
 * map list vectoring provides a degree of flexibility, there is a protocol
 * expected when calling various libc interfaces.
 *
 * i.	Any new alternative link-map list should call CI_THRINIT, and then call
 *	CI_TLS_MODADD to register any TLS for each object of that link-map list
 *	(this item is labeled i. as auditors can be the first objects loaded,
 *	and they exist on their own lik-map list).
 *
 * ii.	For the primary link-map list, CI_TLS_STATMOD must be called first to
 *	register any static TLS.  This routine is called regardless of there
 *	being any TLS, as this routine also establishes the link-map list as the
 *	primary list and fixes the association of uberdata).  CI_THRINIT should
 *	then be called.
 *
 * iii.	Any objects added to an existing link-map list (primary or alternative)
 *	should call CI_TLS_MODADD to register any additional TLS.
 *
 * These events are established by:
 *
 * i.	Typically, libc is loaded as part of the primary dependencies of any
 *	link-map list (since the Unified Process Model (UPM), libc can't be
 *	lazily loaded).  To minimize the possibility of loading and registering
 *	objects, and then tearing them down (because of a relocation error),
 *	external vectors are established as part of load_completion().  This
 *	routine is called on completion of any operation that can cause objects
 *	to be loaded.  This point of control insures the objects have been fully
 *	analyzed and relocated, and moved to their controlling link-map list.
 *	The external vectors are established prior to any .inits being fired.
 *
 * ii.	Calls to CI_THRINIT, and CI_TLS_MODADD also occur as part of
 *	load_completion().  CI_THRINIT is only called once for each link-map
 *	control list.
 *
 * iii.	Calls to CI_TLS_STATMOD, and CI_THRINIT occur for the primary link-map
 *	list in the final stages of setup().
 *
 * The interfaces provide by libc can be divided into two families.  The first
 * family consists of those interfaces that should be called from the link-map
 * list.  It's possible that these interfaces convey state concerning the
 * link-map list they are part of:
 *
 *	CI_ATEXIT
 *	CI TLS_MODADD
 *	CI_TLS_MODREM
 *	CI_TLS_STATMOD
 *	CI_THRINIT
 *
 * The second family are global in nature, that is, the link-map list from
 * which they are called provides no state information.  In fact, for
 * CI_BIND_GUARD, the calling link-map isn't even known.  The link-map can only
 * be deduced after ld.so.1's global lock has been obtained.  Therefore, the
 * following interfaces are also maintained as global:
 *
 *	CI_LCMESSAGES
 *	CI_BIND_GUARD
 *	CI_BIND_CLEAR
 *	CI_THR_SELF
 *
 * Note, it is possible that these global interfaces are obtained from an
 * alternative link-map list that gets torn down because of a processing
 * failure (unlikely, because the link-map list components must be analyzed
 * and relocated prior to load_completion(), but perhaps the tear down is still
 * a possibility).  Thus the global interfaces may have to be replaced.  Once
 * the interfaces have been obtained from the primary link-map, they can
 * remain fixed, as the primary link-map isn't going to go anywhere.
 *
 * The last wrinkle in the puzzle is what happens if an alternative link-map
 * is loaded with no libc dependency?  In this case, the alternative objects
 * can not call CI_THRINIT, can not be allowed to use TLS, and will not receive
 * any atexit processing.
 *
 * The history of these external interfaces is defined by their version:
 *
 * TI_VERSION == 1
 *	Under this model libthread provided rw_rwlock/rw_unlock, through which
 *	all rt_mutex_lock/rt_mutex_unlock calls were vectored.
 *	Under libc/libthread these interfaces provided _sigon/_sigoff (unlike
 *	lwp/libthread that provided signal blocking via bind_guard/bind_clear).
 *
 * TI_VERSION == 2
 *	Under this model only libthreads bind_guard/bind_clear and thr_self
 *	interfaces were used.  Both libthreads blocked signals under the
 *	bind_guard/bind_clear interfaces.   Lower level locking is derived
 *	from internally bound _lwp_ interfaces.  This removes recursive
 *	problems encountered when obtaining locking interfaces from libthread.
 *	The use of mutexes over reader/writer locks also enables the use of
 *	condition variables for controlling thread concurrency (allows access
 *	to objects only after their .init has completed).
 *
 * NOTE, the TI_VERSION indicated the ti_interface version number, where the
 * ti_interface was a large vector of functions passed to both libc (to override
 * the thread stub interfaces) and ld.so.1.  ld.so.1 used only a small subset of
 * these interfaces.
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 1
 *	Introduced with CI_VERSION & CI_ATEXIT
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 2 (Solaris 8 update 2).
 *	Added support for CI_LCMESSAGES
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 3 (Solaris 9).
 *	Added the following versions to the CI table:
 *
 *		CI_BIND_GUARD, CI_BIND_CLEAR, CI_THR_SELF
 *		CI_TLS_MODADD, CI_TLS_MOD_REMOVE, CI_TLS_STATMOD
 *
 *	This version introduced the DT_SUNW_RTLDINFO structure as a mechanism
 *	to handshake with ld.so.1.
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 4 (Solaris 10).
 *	Added the CI_THRINIT handshake as part of the libc/libthread unified
 *	process model.  libc now initializes the current thread pointer from
 *	this interface (and no longer relies on the INITFIRST flag - which
 *	others have started to camp out on).
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 5 (Solaris 11).
 *	Use of "protected" references within libc, so that symbols are
 *	pre-bound, and don't require ld.so.1 binding.  This implementation
 *	protects libc's critical regions from being vectored to auditors.
 *
 * CI_VERSION == 6 (Solaris 11).
 *	Added the CI_CRITICAL handshake, to allow "mem*" family to be reexposed
 *	as "global", and thus be redirected to auxiliary filters.
 *
 * Release summary:
 *
 *	Solaris 8	CI_ATEXIT via _ld_libc()
 *			TI_* via _ld_concurrency()
 *
 *	Solaris 9	CI_ATEXIT and CI_LCMESSAGES via _ld_libc()
 *			CI_* via RTLDINFO and _ld_libc()  - new libthread
 *			TI_* via _ld_concurrency()  - old libthread
 *
 *	Solaris 10	CI_ATEXIT and CI_LCMESSAGES via _ld_libc()
 *			CI_* via RTLDINFO and _ld_libc()  - new libthread
