/*
 * Remove objects.  Objects need removal from a process as part of:
 *
 *  -	a dlclose() request
 *
 *  -	tearing down a dlopen(), lazy-load, or filter hierarchy that failed to
 *	completely load
 *
 * Any other failure condition will result in process exit (in which case all
 * we have to do is execute the fini's - tear down is unnecessary).
 *
 * Any removal of objects is therefore associated with a dlopen() handle.  There
 * is a small window between creation of the first dlopen() object and creating
 * its handle (in which case remove_so() can get rid of the new link-map if
 * necessary), but other than this all object removal is driven by inspecting
 * the components of a handle.
 *
 * Things to note.  The creation of a link-map, and its addition to the link-map
 * list occurs in {elf|aout}_new_lm(), if this returns success the link-map is
 * valid and added, otherwise any steps (allocations) in the process of creating
 * the link-map would have been undone.  If a failure occurs between creating
 * the link-map and adding it to a handle, remove_so() is called to remove the
 * link-map.  If a failures occurs after a handle have been created,
 * remove_hdl() is called to remove the handle and the link-map.
