This directory contains sample programs that demonstrate how to use libelf.
Manual pages for libelf routines are located in section 3e: Library Functions.

Each of these sample programs displays, or manipulates information from a ELF
file.  Each program uses libelf differently.  To learn more about ELF files
and their format refer to the "Linker & Libraries Guide", which is part of the
"Software Developer Collection", and the "System V Application Binary
Interface".

The following source files are provided:

pcom.c		print comment: prints the .comment section of an ELF file.
		Demonstrates how to examine a file opened with
		elf_begin(ELF_C_READ)

acom.c		append comment: appends to, or creates a .comment section
		within an ELF file.  Demonstrates the updating of a file with
		elf_begin(ELF_C_RDWR)

dcom.c		delete comment: deletes a .comment section from an ELF file.
		Demonstrates the creation of a ELF file with
		elf_begin(ELF_C_WRITE)

tpcom.c		threaded print comment:  a threaded version of pcom.c.
		Demonstrates that libelf is MT-Safe and can be used by a
		threaded program.

dispsyms.c	print symbols:  scans a ELF file for any symbol tables
		(SHT_SYMTAB, SHT_DYNSYM, or SHT_SUNW_LDYNSYM) and
		displays the symbol tables contents.

Makefile	make file to build the above programs.


Building the demos
------------------

To build the programs:

  % make all

To test the programs:
