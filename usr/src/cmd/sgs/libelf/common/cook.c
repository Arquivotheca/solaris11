/*
 * Cook the input file.
 *	These functions take the input file buffer and extract
 *	the Ehdr, Phdr table, and the Shdr table.  They keep track
 *	of the buffer status as "fresh," "cooked," or "frozen."
 *
 *	fresh	The file buffer is in its original state and
 *		nothing has yet referenced it.
 *
 *	cooked	The application asked for translated data first
 *		and caused the library to return a pointer into
 *		the file buffer.  After this happens, all "raw"
 *		operations must go back to the disk.
 *
 *	frozen	The application first did a "raw" operation that
 *		prohibits reusing the file buffer.  This effectively
 *		freezes the buffer, and all "normal" operations must
 *		duplicate their data.
 *
 *	For archive handling, these functions conspire to align the
 *	file buffer to the host memory format.  Archive members
 *	are guaranteed only even byte alignment, but the file uses
 *	objects at least 4 bytes long.  If an archive member is about
 *	to be cooked and is not aligned in memory, these functions
 *	"slide" the buffer up into the archive member header.
 *	This sliding never occurs for frozen files.
 *
 *	Some processors might not need sliding at all, if they have
 *	no alignment constraints on memory references.  This code
 *	ignores that possibility for two reasons.  First, even machines
 *	that have no constraints usually handle aligned objects faster
 *	than unaligned.  Forcing alignment here probably leads to better
 *	performance.  Second, there's no way to test at run time whether
 *	alignment is required or not.  The safe thing is to align in
 *	all cases.
 *
 *	This sliding relies on the archive header being disposable.
 *	Only archive members that are object files ever slide.
 *	They're also the only ones that ever need to.  Archives never
 *	freeze to make headers disposable.  Any program peculiar enough
 *	to want a frozen archive pays the penalty.
 *
 *	The library itself inspects the Ehdr and the Shdr table
 *	from the file.  Consequently, it converts the file's data
 *	to EV_CURRENT version, not the working version.  This is
 *	transparent to the user.  The library never looks at the
 *	Phdr table; so that's kept in the working version.
