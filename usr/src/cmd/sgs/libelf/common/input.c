/*
 * File input
 *	These functions read input files.
 *	On SVR4 and newer systems use mmap(2).  On older systems (or on
 *	file systems that don't support mmap, this code simulates mmap.
 *	When reading a file, enough memory is allocated to hold the file's
 *	image, and reads are delayed.  When another part of the library
 *	wants to use a part of the file, it "fetches" the needed regions.
 *
 *	An elf descriptor has a bit array to manage this.  Each bit
 *	represents one "page" of the file.  Pages are grouped into regions.
 *	The page size is tunable.  Its value should be at least one disk
 *	block and small enough to avoid superfluous traffic.
 *
 *	NBITS	The number of bits in an unsigned.  Each unsigned object
 *		holds a "REGION."  A byte must have at least 8 bits;
 *		it may have more, though the extra bits at the top of
 *		the unsigned will be unused.  Thus, for 9-bit bytes and
 *		36-bit words, 4 bits at the top will stay empty.
 *
 *	This mechanism gives significant performance gains for library
 *	handling (among other things), because programs typically don't
 *	need to look at entire libraries.  The fastest I/O is no I/O.
 */

/*
 * This global is used to hold the value of the PAGESIZE macro.

 * sysconfig(_CONFIG_PAGESIZE) system call and we don't want
