 * elf_getshnum() and elf_getshstrndx() were defined during the 2002 gABI
 * meetings. They were supposed to return -1 for failure, and 0 for success.
 * Our manpage documented them as such, but we then implemented them to
 * return 0 for failure and 1 for success. This makes elf_getshnum() and
 * elf_getshstrnum() non-portable to systems that implement the 2002 gABI
 * definition.
 *
 * In 2005, the manpage was modified to match the code.
 * In 2009, the discrepency was identified. elf_getshdrnum() and
 * elf_getshdrstrndx() were created to provide a portable implementation.
 * The older two functions are considered to be obsolete, and are retained
 * for backward compatibility.
