.SH NAME
chkmsg \- cross check messages 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chkmsg
.BI [ -64 ]
.BI file
.BI source_files ...
.SH AVAILABILITY
Internal to the linker group
.SH DESCRIPTION
chkmsg  checks the message identifiers defined in the input file
and the message identifyer used in the input source_files. The input
file is the input file which is used by the sgsmsg command.
.P
The chkmsg command reads the input file and 
generates two sets of message identifiers.
The first set is
the identifiers defined in between the _START_ and _END_ key words.
These identifiers are intended to be referenced by MSG_INTL().
This set is named as MSG_INTL_FROM_INPUT.
.P
The other set is
the identifiers defined after the _END_ key words.
These identifiers are intended to be referenced by MSG_ORIG().
This set is named as MSG_ORIG_FROM_INPUT.
.P
The chkmsg command reads the specified input source_files and
generates two sets of message identifiers. The first set is
the message identifiers referenced by MSG_INTL() macro.
This set is named as MSG_INTL_FROM_SRC.
.P
The other set is the message identifiers referenced by the
MSG_ORIG() macro.
This set is named as MSG_ORIG_FROM_SRC.
.P
The chkmsg command compares MSG_INTL_FROM_SRC and MSG_INTL_FROM_INPUT.
If these two sets are different, the command gives the warning
message and print the identifiers which are different.
.P
The chkmsg command compares MSG_ORIG_FROM_SRC and MSG_ORIG_FROM_INPUT.
If these two sets are different, the command gives the warning
message and print the identifiers which are different.
.P
The identifiers in MSG_INTL_FROM_SRC and MSG_ORIG_FROM_SRC are
extracted from the source files only if they are
directly passed to MSG_INTL() or MSG_ORIG(). Therefore, for example:
.RS
.nf
.ft 3
	char *msg;
		|
	msg = MSG_ERROR_01;
		|
	printf(MSG_INTL(msg));
		|
.fi
.RE
the identifyer MSG_ERROR_01 will not be included in MSG_INTL_FROM_SRC set.
.P
There are two key words which can be used in the input file 
to control whether the identifier will be extracted into 
MSG_{INTL,ORIG}_FROM_ORIG or not. If the identifyer are
surrounded by _CHKMSG_SKIP_BEGIN_ {sparc,i386}
and _CHKMSG_SKIP_END_ {sparc,i386}, then
the identifiers will not be included in the output set.
The architecture being checked should be specified after
the key works.
These key words should be specified in the comment lines.
For example, the input file could contain:
.RS
.nf
.ft 3
	# _CHKMSG_SKIP_BEGIN_ sparc
	@ MSG_ERROR_01	"This identifier is not defined."
	# _CHKMSG_SKIP_END_ sparc
.fi
.RE
.P
It is assumed that the message identifier names are composed
of only upper letters.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B \-64
Use a 64-bit version of the machine type (i.e. sparc => sparcv9).
Note that this option must be specified first on the command line.
