# Standard install rules
# The VAR_SGSBIN and VAR_SGSBIN64 install rules included here are applicable

# standard ROOTBIN and ROOTBIN64 rules defined in ../Makefile.cmd are used.
# The new rules here are included to allow for easier backporting. Making
# the appropriate updates in ./Makefile.var, will allow the SGS components
# to be installed in /usr/ccs/bin rather than the current /usr/bin.

# Linting the Linker Libraries
#
#  Several of the linker's libraries are, in whole or in part, built in two
#  passes, once as Elf32 and once as Elf64 (i.e. with -D_ELF64 defined).  Lint
#  needs to be able to do both passes, but combining the two is problematic for
#  the 2nd pass of lint, as it sees many interfaces as being defined both ways
#  and considers them to be incompatible.  The targets defined here allow for
#  both passes to live independently.  This means that both the lint.out, and
#  the lint library itself get generated separately, to different output files.
#  The lint.out's get combined into a single lint.out report, and the lint
#  libraries get generated with a 32/64 suffix.  The dependents on these lint
#  libraries, then, choose which version they need to use.  Substitutions can
#  be made automatically if the macro's defined in ./Makefile.com are used to
#  specify the dependency, for those libs that need them.
#
# Don't
#
#  Don't use the /*LINTLIBRARY*/ directive in linker libraries, this disables
#  some important checks, including the ability to test format strings from the
#  msg.h files.
#
#  Don't use the `-x' option to lint when linting linker libraries.  This masks
#  all the dead wood in our own header files.  Instead, there has been added to
#  the relevant common directories a file called `lintsup.c' which is used to
#  mask out the headers that we aren't interested in.  This method is used for
#  libraries, like libld, which have their own header files, but is irrelevant
#  to libraries like libldstab which exports no interface of it's own.
#
#  The `lintsup.c' file can also be used, in some cases, to mask out other
#  issues that lint won't otherwise shut up about.
#
# Other Lint Options
#
#  `-m' has been added to the LINTFLAGS.  Warnings about globals that could be
#  static are irrelevant as we use mapfiles to scope down unnecessary globals.
#
#  `-u' is used in the LINTFLAGS for libraries, otherwise lint tends to be very
#  noisy.
#
#  `-x' is avoided for libraries, but is used for executables because all we
#  care about is that what we use is defined, not about declarations in public
#  headers that we don't use.

# A couple of macros used in the SGSLINTOUT rule below
#
#	LINT_HDR - Use sgs/tools/lint_hdr.pl to generate lint output headers
#	LINT_TEE - Use tee to write output to stdout and also capture it
#		in the SGSLINT output file.
#
# An additional complexity: We produce headers for all the lint
# output so that we can tell what came from where when we look
# at the resulting file. We also cat these headers to stdout so that
# the user of make will see them. However, we don't want the headers
# to go to stdout if there is only one of LINTOUT32 and LINTOUT64. To
# the interactive user, the headers are only interesting as a way to
# separate the two ELF classes. We only bother with this for the
# non-DYNLIB and non-RTLD case, because at the current time, both of these
# cases always have both 32 and 64-bit ELFCLASS support.
