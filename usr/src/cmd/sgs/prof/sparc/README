When the source for prof was delivered to SunSoft from SunPro (for delivery 
into SunOS 5.3), prof depended on the library libsymint.a.  This library was
built under the directory lprof/libprof along with the library libprof.a.  
Both libprof.a and libsymint.a shared some source files, which created a 
source sharing problem with SunSoft and SunPro, since SunPro was still 
delivering libprof.a.

Thus to clean up the build, only the object files and headers that prof 
actually needs where moved directly into the build of prof and the dependency
on the library libsymint.a was removed.  This leaves SunPro owning the entire
lprof directory.  The follow source files and headers where copied into the
prof directory from lprof/libprof (prof is the only utilities inherited from 
SunPro that uses libsymint.a) to remove prof dependency of libsymint.a:

	symintOpen.c
	symintClose.c
	symintErr.c
	symintLoad.c
	symintUtil.c
	symint.h
	symintHdr.h
	debug.h

From SunOS 5.3 (aka 1093) on, SunSoft and SunPro will each own their own 
copies of these files and will fix bugs in them only as they relate to their 
own products.
