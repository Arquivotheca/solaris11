# Script to build the MDB modules present in a workspace against the set of
# include files saved in an MDB "root" (created with mkroot.sh), and install
# resulting modules into this tree so that it can be used as the argument
# to ``mdb -R'' or by mdb's auto-detect code, used by the mdb.sh wrapper.
# We use the ``make dmods'' target to do the build -- this is equivalent to
# make install, but does not build the debugger itself, and pass a special
# define (_MDB_BLDID) into the compilation environment so that the module
# source can detect the various changes in header files, etc.  This is only
# used for module source kept on mdb.eng that needs to compile against
# legacy builds of the operating system.
