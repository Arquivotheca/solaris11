 * FMD Control Event Subsystem
 *
 * This file provides a simple and extensible subsystem for the processing of
 * synchronous control events that can be received from the event transport
 * and used to control the behavior of the fault manager itself.  At present
 * this feature is used for the implementation of simulation controls such as
 * advancing the simulated clock using events sent by the fminject utility.
 * Control events are assigned a class of the form "resource.fm.fmd.*" and
 * are assigned a callback function defined in the _fmd_ctls[] table below.
 * As control events are received by the event transport, they are assigned a
 * special event type (ev_type = FMD_EVT_CTL) and the ev_data member is used
 * to refer to a fmd_ctl_t data structure, managed by the functions below.
 *
 * Control events are implemented so that they are synchronous with respect to
 * the rest of the fault manager event stream, which is usually asynchronous
 * (that is, the transport dispatch thread and the module receive threads all
 * execute in parallel).  Synchronous processing is required for control events
 * so that they can affect global state (e.g. the simulated clock) and ensure
 * that the results of any state changes are seen by *all* subsequent events.
 *
 * To achieve synchronization, the event itself implements a thread barrier:
 * the fmd_ctl_t maintains a reference count that mirrors the fmd_event_t
 * reference count (which for ctls counts the number of modules the event
 * was dispatched to).  As each module receive thread dequeues the event, it
 * calls fmd_event_rele() to discard the event, which calls fmd_ctl_rele().
 * fmd_ctl_rele() decrements the ctl's reference count but blocks there waiting
 * for *all* other references to be released.  When all threads have reached
 * the barrier, the final caller of fmd_ctl_rele() executes the control event
 * callback function and then wakes everyone else up.  The transport dispatch
 * thread, blocked in fmd_modhash_dispatch(), is typically this final caller.
