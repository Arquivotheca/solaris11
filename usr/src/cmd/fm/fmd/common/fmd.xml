	  Fault Manager Dependencies.

	    fmd should be started after /var is mounted and rpcbind is
	    running.  It is resilient to the the failure and/or
	    interruption of rpcbind, and therefore does not restart under any
	    circumstance.

	    The dumpadm and sysevent services (global zone only) also list the
	    fmd service as a dependent, with restart_on='none' for both.
