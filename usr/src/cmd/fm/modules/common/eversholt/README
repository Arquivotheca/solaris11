This file is usr/src/cmd/fma/modules/common/eversholt/README.

The files in this directory build the "eft.so" plugin to the
fault management daemon (fmd).  This plugin is a diagnosis engine
driven by one or more eversholt fault tree (.eft) files.

eft.c implements the diagnosis engine entry points expected by
the fmd.  The diagnosis engine is considered platform-neutral
code and is being used on other, non-Solaris platforms.  The platform
specific services it requires are either provided by the fmd interfaces,
or by the routines in platform.c in this directory.

Most of the files that go into building eft.so are shared with the
eversholt compiler.  Those files are pulled in by the Makefile
in this directory.  They live in:
	usr/src/cmd/fma/eversholt/common

When running under Solaris, eft.so uses the hardware topology library
(libtopo) to collect configuration information.
