 * A diagnosis or response subsidiary must provide a struct sw_subinfo with

 * included in the array of struct sw_subinfo pointers in each of
 * software-diagnosis and software-response.
 *
 * swsub_name
 *	This should be chosen to be unique to this subsidiary;
 *	by convention it should also be the name prefix used in any fmd
 *	buffers	the subsidiary creates.
 *
 * swsub_props
 *	A pointer to a constant array of fmd_prop_t for fmd module
 *	properties assocaited with the subsidiary.  Property names
 *	must be unique across subsidiaries.  This pointer can be NULL.
 *
 * swsub_casetype
 *	A diagnosis subsidiary solves cases using swde_case_* below, and it
 *	must specify in swsub_casetype the type of case it solves.  A response
 *	subsidiary must specify SW_CASE_NONE here.  A subsidiary may only solve
 *	at most one type of case, and no two subsidiaries must solve the same
 *	case type.  We use the case type to associate a subsidiary owner of
 *	the fmd case that is really owned by the host module.
 *
 * swsub_init
 *	The initialization function for this subsidiary, akin to the
 *	_fmd_init in a traditional fmd module.  This must not be NULL.
 *
 *	 When the host diagnosis/response module initializes the _fmd_init
 *	 entry point will call the swsub_init function for each subsidiary
 *	 in turn.  The fmd handle has already been registered and timers are
 *	 available for installation (see below);  the swsub_init function must
 *	 return a pointer to a NULL-terminated array of struct sw_disp
 *	 describing the event dispatch preferences for that module, and fill
 *	 an integer we pass with the number of entries in that array (including
 *	 the terminating NULL entry).  The swsub_init function also receives
 *	 a subsidiary-unique id_t assigned by the framework that it should
 *	 keep a note of for use in timer installation (see below);  this id
 *	 should not be persisted to checkpoint data.
 *
 * swsub_fini
 *	When the host module _fmd_fini is called it will call this function
 *	for each subsidiary.  A subsidiary can specify NULL here.
 *
 * swsub_timeout
 *	This is the timeout function to call for expired timers installed by
 *	this subsidiary.  See sw_timer_{install,remove} below.  May be
 *	NULL if no timers are used by this subsidiary.
 *
 * swsub_case_close
 *	This function is called when a case "owned" by a subsidiary
 *	is the subject of an fmdo_close callback.  Can be NULL, and
 *	must be NULL for a subsidiary with case type SW_CASE_NONE (such
 *	as a response subsidiary).
 *
 * swsub_case_verify
 *	This is called during _fmd_init of the host module.  The host module
 *	iterates over all cases that it owns and calls the verify function
 *	for the real owner which may choose to close cases if they no longer
 *	apply.  Can be NULL, and must be NULL for a subsidiary with case
 *	type SW_CASE_NONE.

 * The software-diagnosis subsidiaries can open and solve cases; to do so
 * they must use the following wrappers to the usual fmd module API case
 * management functions.  We need this so that a subsidiary can iterate
 * over *its* cases (fmd_case_next would iterate over those of other
 * subsidiaries), receive in the subsidiary a callback when a case it opened
 * is closed, etc.  The subsidiary can use other fmd module API members
 * for case management, such as fmd_case_add_ereport.
 *
 * Each subsidiary opens cases of its own unique type, identified by
 * the sw_casetype enumeration.  The values used in this enumeration
 * must never change - they are written to checkpoint state.
 *
 * swde_case_open
 *	Opens a new case of the correct subsidiary type for the given
 *	subsidiary id.  If a uuid string is provided then open a case
 *	with that uuid using fmd_case_open_uuid, allowing case uuid
 *	to match some relevant uuid that was received in one of the
 *	events that has led us to open this case.
 *
 *	If the subsidiary wishes to associate some persistent
 *	case data with the new case thenit can fmd_hdl_alloc and complete a
 *	suitably-packed serialization structure and include a pointer to it
 *	in the call to sw_case_open together with the structure size and
 *	structure version.  The	framework will create a new fmd buffer (named
 *	for you, based on the case type) and write the structure out to disk;
 *	when the module or fmd is restarted this structure is restored from
 *	disk for you and reassociated with the case - use swde_case_data to
 *	retrieve a pointer to it.
 *
 * swde_case_setspecific, swde_case_getspecific
 *
 *	Unlike fmd_case_open, swde_case_open does not have an opaque
 *	case-specific data pointer argument.  Use swde_case_setspecific
 *	to set such data, and swde_case_setspecific to retrieve it.
 *	Do not use fmd_case_setspecific or fmd_case_getspecfic directly.
 *
 * swde_case_first, swde_case_next
 *	A subsidiary DE can iterate over its cases using swde_case_first and
 *	swde_case_next.  For swde_case_first quote the subsidiary id;
 *	for swde_case_next quote the last case returned.
 *
 * swde_case_data
 *	Returns a pointer to the previously-serialized case data, and fills
 *	a uint32_t with the version of that serialized data.
 *
 * swde_case_data_write
 *	Whenever a subsidiary modifies its persistent data structure
 *	it must call swde_case_data_write to indicate that the associated
 *	fmd buffer is dirty and needs to be rewritten.
 *
 * swde_case_data_upgrade
 *	If the subsidiary ever revs its persistent structure it needs to call
 *	swde_case_data_upgrade to register the new version and structure size,
 *	and write the structure out to a reallocated fmd buffer;  the old
 *	case data structure (if any) will be freed.  A subsidiary may use
 *	this interface to migrate old persistence structures restored from
 *	checkpoint - swde_case_data will return a version number below the
 *	current.
