 * /dev/bmc IPMI monitor
 *
 * The purpose of this module is to monitor the connection between the system
 * and the service processor attached via /dev/bmc.  The module assumes the SP
 * supports the Sun OEM uptime IPMI command.  If the BMC connection does not
 * exist, or the uptime function is not implemented, then the module unloads
 * without doing anything.
 *
 * When the module is first loaded, or a reset is detected, the module will
 * generate the ESC_PLATFORM_SP_RESET sysevent as a system-wide notification to
 * indicate that this event has occurred.
 *
 * Note that this event generation is not guaranteed to have a one-to-one
 * correspondence with an SP reset.  There is no persistence, so if fmd is
 * restarted we will generate this event again.  Thus the event only indicates
 * the possibility that the SP has been reset.  This could be enhanced using fmd
 * checkpoints to have some persistent state to avoid this scenario.  However,
 * it currently serves the useful dual purpose of notifying consumers of system
 * startup as well as SP reset through a single channel.
