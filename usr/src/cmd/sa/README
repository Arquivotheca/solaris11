README 1.9 of 5/8/89

Instruction of daily report generation:

1.  The line

    /usr/lib/sa/sadc /var/adm/sa/sa`date +%d`

    is executed by the start method for the system/sar:default service,
    if enabled

    sadc is executed once, such that a special record is written to
    the daily data file when UNIX restarts.

2.  The execution of shell script
    sa1 [t n]
    causes data collection program to write system activity
    counters n times at every t-second interval on data file.
    If t and n are not specified, it writes data once.
    According to your installation's requirement, enter
    entries of executing  sa1 [t n] in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys
    to collect system activity data.
    For example, entries

    0 8-17 * * 1-5 su sys -c "/usr/lib/sa/sa1 1200 3 &" and
    0 18-23 * * 1-5 su sys -c "/usr/lib/sa/sa1 &"

    cause data collection program to be activated at every hour
    on the hour from 8:00 to 23:00 on weekdays.
    Moreover, It writes data on data file 3 times at every 20
    minutes interval from 8:00 to 17:00 and once at other times.

3.  Shell procedure sa2 will invoke sar command to generate
    the daily report from the data file.  Its usage is

    sa2 [-options] [-s hh:mm] [-e hh:mm] [-i ss]

    where -s and -e specify the report starting and ending times
    respectively, -i specifies the report data interval in seconds.
    If they are not specified, all data from the data file are to
    be reported.  -options are report options, see manual page
    sar.1 for description.

    Make an entry to execute sa2 in /var/spool/cron/crontabs.
    For instance, entry

    5 18 * * 1-5 su adm -c "/usr/lib/sa/sa2 -s 8:00 -e 18:01 -i 3600
    -ubd &"

    causes the invocation of sar command at 18:05.  It generates
    the daily report that includes the hourly cpu utilization,
    buffer usage and disk and tape  activities from 8:00 to 18:01.
