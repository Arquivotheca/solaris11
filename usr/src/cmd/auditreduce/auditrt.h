 * Process Control Block
 * A pcb comes in two types:
 * It controls either:

 * 1.	A single group of pcbs (processes that are lower on the process tree).
 *	These are the pcb's that the process tree is built from.
 *	These are allocated as needed while the process tree is	being built.
 *
 * 2.	A single group of files (fcbs).
 *	All of the files in one pcb have the same suffix in their filename.
 *	They are controlled by the leaf nodes of the process tree.
 *	They are found in audit_pcbs[].
 *	They are initially setup by process_fileopt() when the files to be
 *	processes are gathered together. Then they are parsed out to
 *	the leaf nodes by mfork().
 *	A particular leaf node's range of audit_pcbs[] is determined
 *	in the call to mfork() by the lo and hi paramters.
