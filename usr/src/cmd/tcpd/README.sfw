Built with the Sun Workshop Compilers.

The Makefile has been edited to define the appropriate system parameters for
Solaris 9 except for REAL_DAEMON_DIR which must be defined on the command
line as below or by editing the Makefile.  The sunos5 make target will build
the Solaris compatible libwrap shared object and the executable programs
including tcpd.

There is no configure script.  Instead unset the environment variable
HOSTNAME and build using

	env \
		MAKE="/usr/bin/make -e" \
		/usr/bin/make -e \
		REAL_DAEMON_DIR=/usr/sbin \
		sunos5

The header tcpd.h has been modified to define HAVE_IPV6, so that consumers of
the file do not have to define HAVE_IPV6 and will always get data structures
that are compatible with the libwrap.so.1 shipped with Solaris.  HAVE_IPV6 is
defined since this is the IPv6 version of tcp_wrappers and Solaris supports
IPv6.
