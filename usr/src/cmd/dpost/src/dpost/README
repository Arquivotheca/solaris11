Source code for a program that translates device independent troff output into
PostScript.

Several new text encoding schemes, based on widthshow, have been added. Each can
be accessed using the -e option and often reduce print time by 20% or more. Level
0 is the slowest but most stable choice. Level 2 encoding (which right now is the
default) is fast and does a good job placing text and justifying the right margin.
You can change the default encoding scheme by adjusting the definition of ENCODING
in ../Makefile. Levels 0, 1, and 2 are the only reasonable defaults, but at present
only level 0 is guaranteed. The new encoding schemes are not thoroughly tested,
but passed the tests I ran.

Other interesting features include color support, the ability to treat complex
paths built from the standard drawing commands as single entities (eg. for filling
a polygon with a color), and reverse video printing as a special case of color.
Also added, although using it is far from trivial, is the ability to set text
along an arbitrary baseline (see ../postscript/baseline.ps). All are accessed via
special device control escapes (from routine devcntrl() in dpost.c).

ASCII font and description files for many standard PostScript fonts can be found
in ../font/devpost. They should be installed in /usr/lib/font/devpost, and are
read when you add the -Tpost option to troff. A typical command line would be,

    pic file | tbl | eqn | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost >file.ps

while,

    pic -T720 file | tbl | eqn -r720 | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost >file.ps

should work if you're using old versions of eqn and pic.
