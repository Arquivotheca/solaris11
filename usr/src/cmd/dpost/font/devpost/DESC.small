# A DESC file that can be used with the new version of makedev to produce smaller
# DESC.out files. May help if you're running troff on a PC with a small address
# space. biggestfont is set to the size of the CW font, and will accomodate all
# font files except S and ZD. If you use this version ZD will only be mountable
# in font position 0 using \f(ZD. To use it replace DESC by DESC.small before
# building the binary font files. Also included a version of the S font file,
# S.small, that has all unnamed characters (ie. ones named by ---) removed. Using
# it will further decrease the size of DESC.out - but may not be necessary.
