Elimination of /usr/kvm
=======================

As of Solaris 2.5, the /usr/kvm directory is no longer needed by the
operating environment.  The mount point continues to be provided for
backward compatibility although all of the contents have been removed.

In earlier releases, /usr/kvm contained the platform specific implementations
of programs and libraries.  The interface to these platform specific
implementations was generally advertized to be in a platform independent
directory and a symbolic link was used to bind the advertized platform
independent interface to the platform specific implementation in /usr/kvm.

Implementation		Interface(s)

/usr/kvm/adb		/usr/bin/adb

/usr/kvm/arch		/usr/ucb/arch

			Note: Source Compatibility Package Component

/usr/kvm/crash		/usr/bin/mdb

			Note: Solaris Modular Debugger Guide describes how to
			transition from crash(1M) to mdb(1).

/usr/kvm/eeprom		/usr/sbin/eeprom

/usr/kvm/i286,i386,i486,i860,i86pc,iAPX286,m68k,mc68000,mc68010,mc68020,
	mc68030,mc68040,sparc,sun,sun2,sun3,sun3x,sun4,sun4c,sun4d,sun4e,
	sun4m,u370,u3b,u3b15,u3b2,u3b5,vax
			/usr/bin/i286,i386,i486,i860,i86pc,iAPX286,m68k,
			mc68000,mc68010,mc68020,mc68030,mc68040,sparc,sun,
			sun2,sun3,sun3x,sun4,sun4c,sun4d,sun4e,sun4m,u370,
			u3b,u3b15,u3b2,u3b5,vax

			Note:	These are documented on the machid(1) manual
				page.  These are fully deprecated interfaces.

/usr/kvm/libkvm.a	/usr/lib/libkvm.a

			Note:	/usr/lib/libkvm.a is no longer a component
				of SunOS.

/usr/kvm/libkvm.so.1	/usr/lib/libkvm.so.1
/usr/kvm/libkvm.so	/usr/lib/libkvm.so


The following platform specific objects were also delivered in previous
releases of SunOS.  They are only of use with specific platforms and
it was always documented that the path to these objects was uncommitted.

2.4 (and earlier)	2.5

/usr/kvm/cg14config	/usr/platform/sun4m/sbin/cg14config	sun4m only

/usr/kvm/sxconfig	/usr/platform/sun4m/sbin/sxconfig	sun4m only

/usr/kvm/prtdiag	/usr/platform/sun4d/sbin/prtdiag	sun4d only
