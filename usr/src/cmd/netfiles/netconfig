# The "Network Configuration" File.

# Each entry is of the form:
#
#       <network_id> <semantics> <flags> <protofamily> <protoname> \
#               <device> <nametoaddr_libs>
#
# The "-" in <nametoaddr_libs> for inet family transports indicates
# redirection to the name service switch policies for "hosts" and
# "services". The "-" may be replaced by nametoaddr libraries that
# comply with the SVr4 specs, in which case the name service switch
# will not be used for netdir_getbyname, netdir_getbyaddr,
# gethostbyname, gethostbyaddr, getservbyname, and getservbyport.
# There are no nametoaddr_libs for the inet family in Solaris anymore.
