The first thing you should look at is the documentation.  The two
critical documents are "Sendmail - An Internetwork Router" and
"Sendmail - Installation and Operation Guide". Read both of these
before proceeding with your installation.  If you have read these
before, you should still read through the second one again anyhow,
since the installation procedures change occasionally.

A brief tour:
	Makefile  A Makefile that will install Sendmail on Solaris.
	Makefile.cmd  Some Makefile variable definitions included by subdirs.
	READ_ME	  This file.
	aux	  Useful programs and shell scripts for debugging and
		  administering sendmail and the network mail environment.
		  Also, some C source files for peculiar configurations.
	db	  The Berkeley Database, built for linking with aux/makemap
		  and src/sendmail .
	cf	  The sources and "object" for the configuration files.
	include	  Various headers files.
	lib	  Master copies of files used by sendmail, e.g. the aliases
		  file.
	libsm	  Sendmail general library.
	libsmdb	  Sendmail database library; for use with makemap and
		  praliases
	libsmutil Sendmail utility library; various general-purpose routines
		  needed by sendmail and its auxiliary programs.
	src	  The source for the sendmail program itself.

Sendmail is fully supported by Sun Microsystems, like any other part of
Solaris.  Contact Sun technical support if you have problems.

Sendmail was originally written by Eric Allman of Sendmail, Inc.
