 *
 * contents:
 *
 *  change analysis:
 *	analyze .... (top level) analyze all files in the tree for changes
 *	summary .... print out change/reconciliation statistics for each base
 *	check_file . (static) look for changes and queue file for reconciliation
 *	check_changes (static) figure out if a particular file has changed
 *	queue_file . (static) add a file to the reconciliation list
 *
 *  other tree enumeration functions:
 *	prune_file . (static) recursive descent and actual pruning
 *	prune ...... (top level) initiate pruning analysis for nonexistant files
 *	find_link .. look for other files to which a file may be a link
 *	link_update. propagate changed stat info to all other links
 *	same_name .. (static) figure out if two nodes describe same file
 *
 *  misc:
 *	push_name .. maintain a running full pathname as we descend
 *	pop_name ... maintain a running full pathname as we pop back
 *	get_name ... return full pathname for the current file
 *
 * notes:
 *	analysis is limited to files that were evaluated in the previous
