# For modifying the behavior of rmtmpfiles, do not edit this script.
# Instead use svccfg(1m) to modify the SMF repository.  To achieve
# traditional System V treatment of /var/tmp, invoke the following
# commands.:
#
# # svccfg
# svc:> select system/rmtmpfiles
# svc:/system/rmtmpfiles> setprop options/clean_vartmp="true"
# svc:/system/rmtmpfiles> select default
# svc:/system/rmtmpfiles:default> refresh
# svc:/system/rmtmpfiles:default> exit

# Traditional SunOS 4.x behavior has been to not remove directories in
# the /tmp directory; only simple files were removed. This lead to an
# inconsistency when the tmpfs file system was used (which isn't persistent
# across boots. The following adopts the traditional System V behavior
# of removing everything in /tmp, unless /tmp or any of its subdirectories
# are mount points for another filesystem.
