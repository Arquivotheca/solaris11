/*
 * The primary role of this file is to obtain a list of manifests that are
 * located in a specified directory or one of its subdirectories.  The
 * find_manifests() function provides this service, and
 * free_manifest_array() is used to free the memory associated with the
 * returned list.
 *
 * The find_manifests() function can return an array consisting of all the
 * .xml files in the directory and its subdirectories.  Alternatively,
 * find_manifests() can be asked to only return new manifests based on the
 * return of mhash_test_file().  The list that is returned is an array of
 * pointers to manifest_info structures.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * ====================
 * This module makes use of the nftw(3C) function to scan the directory.
 * nftw() calls a processing function for every file that it finds.
 * Unfortunately, nftw does not allow us to pass in any structure pointers
 * to the processing function, and that makes it hard to accumulate a list.
 * Thus, we will use the thread specific data area to hold data that must
 * be retained between calls to the processing function.  This will allow
 * this module to be used in multi-threaded applications if the need
 * arises.

 * 	files that do not have a hash entry in the smf/manifest table
 * 	or the hash value has changed due to the bundle file having
 * 	been modified.  If not set then all service bundle files found

 * empty, and a count of 0 will be returned.  In the case of failure, -1
