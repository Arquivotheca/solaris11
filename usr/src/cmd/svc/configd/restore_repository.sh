The backups are named based on their type and the time what they were taken.
Backups beginning with "boot" are made before the first change is made to
the repository after system boot.  Backups beginning with "manifest_import"
are made after svc:/system/manifest-import:default finishes its processing.
The time of backup is given in YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format.

restore it, or one of the following choices:

	CHOICE		  ACTION

	boot		  restore the most recent post-boot backup
	manifest_import	  restore the most recent manifest_import backup
	-seed-		  restore the initial starting repository  (All
