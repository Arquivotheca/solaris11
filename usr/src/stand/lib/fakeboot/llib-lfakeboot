/*
 * As discussed in <sys/bootsyms.h>, most of the symbols over in psm are
 * not properly prototyped anywhere.  One consequence of this is that the
 * lint libraries that should contain these symbols are either missing or
 * incorrectly built.
 *
 * While that mess certainly needs to be fixed, it's going to take a long
 * time and in the meantime we'd like the binaries under stand/lib to be
 * lint-clean and linted nightly.  To make that possible, we use this lint
 * stub to generate a lint library (llib-lfakeboot.ln) that contains the
 * correct definitions for all the symbols that should be provided by the
 * objects over in psm.
 *
 * As parts of psm are cleaned up and fixed to properly build lint libraries,
 * the definitions for those symbols should be removed from here.  Eventually,
 * this file should just go away entirely.
