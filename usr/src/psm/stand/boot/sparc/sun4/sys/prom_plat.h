/*
 * Memory allocation plus memory/mmu interfaces:
 *
 * Routines with fine-grained memory and MMU control are platform-dependent.
 *
 * MMU node virtualized "mode" arguments and results for Spitfire MMU:
 *
 * The default virtualized "mode" for client program mappings created
 * by the firmware is as follows:
 *
 * G (global)		Clear
 * L (locked)		Clear
 * W (write)		Set
 * R (read - soft)	Set (Prom is not required to implement soft bits)
 * X (exec - soft)	Set (Prom is not required to implement soft bits)
 * CV,CP (Cacheable)	Set if memory page, Clear if IO page
 * E (side effects)	Clear if memory page; Set if IO page
 * IE (Invert endian.)	Clear
 *
 * The following fields are initialized as follows in the TTE-data for any
 * mappings created by the firmware on behalf of the client program:
 *
 * P (Priviledged)	Set
 * V (Valid)		Set
 * NFO (No Fault Only)	Clear
 * Context		0
 * Soft bits		< private to the firmware implementation >
 *
 * Page size of Prom mappings are typically 8k, "modify" cannot change
 * page sizes. Mappings created by "map" are 8k pages.
 *
 * If the virtualized "mode" is -1, the defaults as shown above are used,
 * otherwise the virtualized "mode" is set (and returned) based on the
 * following virtualized "mode" abstractions. The mmu node "translations"
 * property contains the actual tte-data, not the virtualized "mode".
 *
 * Note that client programs may not create locked mappings by setting
 * the LOCKED bit. There are Spitfire specific client interfaces to create
 * and remove locked mappings. (SUNW,{i,d}tlb-load).
 * The LOCKED bit is defined here since it may be returned by the
 * "translate" method.
 *
 * The PROM is not required to implement the Read and eXecute soft bits,
 * and is not required to track them for the client program. They may be
 * set on calls to "map" and "modfify" and may be ignored by the firmware,
 * and are not necessarily returned from "translate".
 *
 * The TTE soft bits are private to the firmware.  No assumptions may
 * be made regarding the contents of the TTE soft bits.
 *
 * Changing a mapping from cacheable to non-cacheable implies a flush
 * or invalidate operation, if necessary.
 *
 * NB: The "map" MMU node method should NOT be used to create IO device
 * mappings. The correct way to do this is to call the device's parent
 * "map-in" method using the CALL-METHOD client interface service.
