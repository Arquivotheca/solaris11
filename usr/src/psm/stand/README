README file for the usr/src/stand directory:	(tpl 8/1/94)
					please update this as required

This tree has source code for both sparc and x86 platforms.
1). The lint target is implemented, but the source tree is not lint-free yet.
2). It is too much of a change to "clean-up" this directory at the time
    of stand and stand.i386 merge.  So, let's use the following rule for
    the benefit of all.
    Each time you check in a new version of a file, please try to
	a). lint that file individually
	b). cstyle that file
3). Please avoid using the following fragments in the common/ directory
	#ifdef i386
	#ifdef sparc
4). The following fragment is non-ideal for the merge (promif) source base
	#ifdef I386BOOT
     It should be removed, re-org'ed after a good understanding of the
     pieces involved and with suitable testing.
5). If you change "common" source files including Makefiles, you have
    to build [ and test ] for all platforms.
6). The following list should be addressed and eliminated as we continue
    to separate the PSM code out of shared common (PIM) code
    a). nfs_readsize for sun4 and i386.
    b). lib/fs/nfs_inet/netaddr.h: MAX_PKT_SIZE different between i386 and sparc
    c). lib/fs/nfs_inet/nfsops.c: boot_nfs_read() uses local buffer for i386 case
    d). all #ifdef sparc caused by prom_getversion() calls

Commonly asked questions and brief answers:

Q: Why is inetboot packaged differently?
A: inetboot is loaded by PROM code, especially old PROMs.  They load
   to certain specific address and can only recognize a.out header.
   Thus, inetboot has to be packaged accordingly.  Note that the bootblk
   for sparc has the same constraints.  These historical reasons do
   not apply for i386 architecture.
