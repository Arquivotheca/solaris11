# This file defines the current capabilities of GRUB over and above that
# supported by the standard distribution
#
# The version field contains the version of the associated GRUB software.
# The version is incremented by .1 (minor version number) each time there
# is a bugfix or enhancement of GRUB. In addition, the major version number
# is bumped up by 1 every time a release boundary is crossed. Thus if in S11
# the starting version is 3, in S12 the starting version will be 4.
# Note that the first major number in each sequence is a whole integer
# i.e. 2.0 is truncated to 2 and 3.0 is truncated to 3.
#
# This file and the associated version are Solaris specific and are
# not a part of the open source distribution of GRUB.
