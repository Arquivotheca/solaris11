# Only publish packages for the currently specified architecture
#
# This is somewhat nonintuitive.  In English:
#
#	For any action of type "set",
#	if the "name" property matches the regex "variant.arch",
#	and *every* occurrence of the "value" property does not match
#		$ARCH, then don't publish it.
#
# ...in other words, if *any* occurrence of "value" matches $(ARCH),
# then the negative lookahead assertion in the regex will fail, and we
# won't abort based on the action.
#
<transform set name=variant.arch value=^(?!$(ARCH)).+$ -> abort>

#
# Don't publish nonredistributable manifests in an open-only build
#
$(OPEN_BUILD)<transform set name=org.opensolaris.redist value=nonredist|internal -> abort>

#
# Catch don't-publish settings from manifest-embedded transforms
#
<transform set name=osnet.publish value=false -> abort>
<transform set name=osnet.publish -> drop>
