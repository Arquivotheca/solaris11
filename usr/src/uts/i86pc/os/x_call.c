/*
 * Implementation for cross-processor calls via interprocessor interrupts
 *
 * This implementation uses a message passing architecture to allow multiple
 * concurrent cross calls to be in flight at any given time. We use the cmpxchg
 * instruction, aka casptr(), to implement simple efficient work queues for
 * message passing between CPUs with almost no need for regular locking.
 * See xc_extract() and xc_insert() below.
 *
 * The general idea is that initiating a cross call means putting a message
 * on a target(s) CPU's work queue. Any synchronization is handled by passing
 * the message back and forth between initiator and target(s).
 *
 * Every CPU has xc_work_cnt, which indicates it has messages to process.
 * This value is incremented as message traffic is initiated and decremented
 * with every message that finishes all processing.
 *
 * The code needs no mfence or other membar_*() calls. The uses of
 * casptr(), cas32() and atomic_dec_32() for the message passing are
 * implemented with LOCK prefix instructions which are equivalent to mfence.
 *
 * One interesting aspect of this implmentation is that it allows 2 or more
 * CPUs to initiate cross calls to intersecting sets of CPUs at the same time.
 * The cross call processing by the CPUs will happen in any order with only
 * a guarantee, for xc_call() and xc_sync(), that an initiator won't return
 * from cross calls before all slaves have invoked the function.
 *
 * The reason for this asynchronous approach is to allow for fast global
 * TLB shootdowns. If all CPUs, say N, tried to do a global TLB invalidation
 * on a different Virtual Address at the same time. The old code required
 * N squared IPIs. With this method, depending on timing, it could happen
 * with just N IPIs.
 */

/*
 * The default is to not enable collecting counts of IPI information, since
 * the updating of shared cachelines could cause excess bus traffic.
 */

 * Values for message states. Here are the normal transitions. A transition
 * of "->" happens in the slave cpu and "=>" happens in the master cpu as
 * the messages are passed back and forth.
 *
 * FREE => ASYNC ->                       DONE => FREE
 * FREE => CALL ->                        DONE => FREE
 * FREE => SYNC -> WAITING => RELEASED -> DONE => FREE
 *
 * The interesing one above is ASYNC. You might ask, why not go directly
 * to FREE, instead of DONE. If it did that, it might be possible to exhaust
 * the master's xc_free list if a master can generate ASYNC messages faster
 * then the slave can process them. That could be handled with more complicated
 * handling. However since nothing important uses ASYNC, I've not bothered.
