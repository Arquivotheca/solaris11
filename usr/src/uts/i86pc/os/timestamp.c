/*
 * Using the Pentium's TSC register for gethrtime()
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The Pentium family, like many chip architectures, has a high-resolution
 * timestamp counter ("TSC") which increments once per CPU cycle.  The contents
 * of the timestamp counter are read with the RDTSC instruction.
 *
 * As with its UltraSPARC equivalent (the %tick register), TSC's cycle count
 * must be translated into nanoseconds in order to implement gethrtime().
 * We avoid inducing floating point operations in this conversion by
 * implementing the same hrt->nsec_scale algorithm as that found in the sun4u
 * platform code.  The sun4u NATIVE_TIME_TO_NSEC_SCALE block comment contains
 * a detailed description of the algorithm; the comment is not reproduced
 * here.  This implementation differs only in its value for NSEC_SHIFT:
 * we implement an NSEC_SHIFT of 5 (instead of sun4u's 4) to allow for
 * 60 MHz Pentiums.
 *
 * While TSC and %tick are both cycle counting registers, TSC's functionality
 * falls short in several critical ways:
 *
 *  (a)	TSCs on different CPUs are not guaranteed to be in sync.  While in
 *	practice they often _are_ in sync, this isn't guaranteed by the
 *	architecture.
 *
 *  (b)	The TSC cannot be reliably set to an arbitrary value.  The architecture
 *	only supports writing the low 32-bits of TSC, making it impractical
 *	to rewrite.
 *
 *  (c)	The architecture doesn't have the capacity to interrupt based on
 *	arbitrary values of TSC; there is no TICK_CMPR equivalent.
 *
 * Together, (a) and (b) imply that software must track the skew between
 * TSCs and account for it (it is assumed that while there may exist skew,
 * there does not exist drift).  To determine the skew between CPUs, we
 * have newly onlined CPUs call tsc_sync_slave(), while the CPU performing
 * the online operation calls tsc_sync_master().
 *
 * In the absence of time-of-day clock adjustments, gethrtime() must stay in
 * sync with gettimeofday().  This is problematic; given (c), the software
 * cannot drive its time-of-day source from TSC, and yet they must somehow be
 * kept in sync.  We implement this by having a routine, tsc_tick(), which
 * is called once per second from the interrupt which drives time-of-day.
 *
 * Note that the hrtime base for gethrtime, hrt->tsc_hrtime_base, is modified
 * atomically with hrt->nsec_scale under CLOCK_LOCK.  This assures that time
 * monotonically increases.
 */

/*
 * These two variables used to be grouped together inside of a structure that
 * lived on a single cache line. A regression (bug ID 4623398) caused the

 * algorithm that can read both CPUs in perfect simultaneity. The proposed
 * algorithm is an approximate method based on the behaviour of cache
 * management. The slave CPU continuously reads TSC and then reads a global
 * variable which the master CPU updates. The moment the master's update reaches
 * the slave's visibility (being forced by an mfence operation) we use the TSC
 * reading taken on the slave. A corresponding TSC read will be taken on the
 * master as soon as possible after finishing the mfence operation. But the
 * delay between causing the slave to notice the invalid cache line and the
 * competion of mfence is not repeatable. This error is heuristically assumed
 * to be 1/4th of the total write time as being measured by the two TSC reads
 * on the master sandwiching the mfence. Furthermore, due to the nature of
 * bus arbitration, contention on memory bus, etc., the time taken for the write
 * to reflect globally can vary a lot. So instead of taking a single reading,
 * a set of readings are taken and the one with least write time is chosen
 * to calculate the final skew.
 *
 * TSC sync is disabled in the context of virtualization because the CPUs
 * assigned to the guest are virtual CPUs which means the real CPUs on which
 * guest runs keep changing during life time of guest OS. So we would end up
 * calculating TSC skews for a set of CPUs during boot whereas the guest
 * might migrate to a different set of physical CPUs at a later point of
