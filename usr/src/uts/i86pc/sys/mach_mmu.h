 * Defines for the bits in X86 and AMD64 Page Tables

 * Notes:
 *
 * Largepages and PAT bits:
 *
 * bit 7 at level 0 is the PAT bit
 * bit 7 above level 0 is the Pagesize bit (set for large page)
 * bit 12 (when a large page) is the PAT bit
 *
 * In Solaris the PAT/PWT/PCD values are set up so that:
 *
 * PAT & PWT -> Write Protected
 * PAT & PCD -> Write Combining
 * PAT by itself (PWT == 0 && PCD == 0) yields uncacheable (same as PCD == 1)
 *
 *
 * Permission bits:
 *
 * - PT_USER must be set in all levels for user pages
 * - PT_WRITE must be set in all levels for user writable pages
 * - PT_NX applies if set at any level
 *
 * For these, we use the "allow" settings in all tables above level 0 and only
 * ever disable things in PTEs.
 *
 * The use of PT_GLOBAL and PT_NX depend on being enabled in processor
 * control registers. Hence, we use a variable to reference these bit
 * masks. During hat_kern_setup() if the feature isn't enabled we
 * clear out the variables.
