/*
 * Boot time configuration information objects
 *
 * The BS_VERSION version number should be incremented when adding
 * new boot_syscalls entry points.  The kernel can check the boot_syscalls
 * version number by looking up the BS_VERSION_PROP property in the
 * device tree.  This version number allows the kernel to detect if the
 * version of boot.bin that loaded it supports newer boot_syscalls entry
 * points.  This in turn allows the kernel to potentially support
 * backward compatibility with older versions of boot.bin that don't
 * support newer entry points.
 *
 * (Before we get too carried away with extending this interface,
 * realize how broken it is.  Even with a cleaner namespace than
 * we used to have prior to S10, it is -extremely- difficult to
 * interpose upon because the method pointer is NOT passed to the
 * methods.  We would do well to extend the bootops and EOL this
 * interface as fast as possible, rather than to add more to it.)
