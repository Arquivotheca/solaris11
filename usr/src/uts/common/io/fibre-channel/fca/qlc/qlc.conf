#   File is setup as the default parameters for all adapters in the
#   system.
#   If a parameter needs to be changed for a particular adapter,
#   make a copy of the parameter. Then change the hba number
#   (decimal) in the parameter to match the adapter instance number
#   that is displayed during the boot process. Now alter the
#   parameter for the adapter.
#
#   example:
#       Setting hard address of 124 and 125 for adapter
#       instance 3 and 4 respectively.
#
#       Before:
#           enable-adapter-hard-loop-ID=0;
#
#           adapter-hard-loop-ID=0;
#
#       After:
#           enable-adapter-hard-loop-ID=0;
#           hba3-enable-adapter-hard-loop-ID=1;

#       mode sensing capability (a G port), it is recommended that this
#       parameter be set to either 0 or 1, not 2. Setting this
#       parameter to 2 when connected to a G port on a switch may
#       result in device lost or system hang.

#Name:  Firmware Dump Flags
#Type:  Integer, flag bits; Range: 0 (disable), 1 (enable); Default: 0

#       this variable does not exist or is not equal to 128, 256, 512,
