 * Register: RdcRxCfg1
 * DMA Configuration 1
 * Description: Configuration parameters for receive DMA block.
 * Fields in this register are part of the dma configuration and
 * cannot be changed once the dma is enabled.
 * The usage of enable, reset, and qst is as follows. Software
 * should use the following sequence to reset a DMA channel. First,
 * set DMA.enable to 0, wait for DMA.qst=1 and then, set DMA.reset to
 * 1. After DMA.reset is cleared by hardware and the DMA.qst is set
 * to 1, software may then start configuring the DMA channel. The
 * DMA.enable can be set or cleared while the DMA is in operation.
 * The state machines of the DMA may not have returned to its initial
 * states yet after the DMA.enable bit is cleared. This condition is
 * indicated by the value of the DMA.qst. An example of DMA.enable
 * being cleared during operation is when a fatal error occurs.
 * Fields:
 *     Set to 1 to enable the Receive DMA. If set to 0, packets
 *     selecting this DMA will be discarded. On fatal errors, this
 *     bit will be cleared by hardware. This bit cannot be set if sw
 *     has not resolved any pending fatal error condition: i.e. any
 *     RdcStat ldf1 error bits remain set.
 *     Set to 1 to reset the DMA. Hardware will clear this bit after
 *     reset is completed. A reset will bring the sepecific DMA back
 *     to the power on state (including the DMA.en in this register).
 *     When set to 1, it indicates all state associated with the DMA
 *     are in its initial state following either dma reset or
 *     disable. Thus, once this is set to 1, sw could start to
 *     configure the DMA if needed.
 *     Bits [43:32] of the Mailbox address.

/*
 * Register: RdcStat
 * RDC Control And Status
 * Description: The DMA channels are controlled using this register.
 * Fields:
 *     Set to 1 to indicate rdc received a response completion
 *     timeout from peu. Fatal error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate poisoned completion or non-zero
 *     (unsuccessful) completion status received from PEU. Part of
 *     LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to enable mailbox update. Hardware will reset to 0
 *     after one update. Software needs to set to 1 for each update.
 *     Write 0 has no effect. Note that once set by software, only
 *     hardware can reset the value. This bit is also used to keep
 *     track of the exclusivity between threshold triggered or
 *     timeout triggered interrupt. If this bit is not set, there
 *     will be no timer based interrupt, and threshold based
 *     interrupt will not issue a mailbox update. It is recommended
 *     that software should set this bit to one when arming the
 *     device for interrupt.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate RCR threshold crossed. This is a level
 *     event. Part of LDF 0.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate RCR time-outed if MEX bit is set and the
 *     queue length is non-zero when timeout occurs. When software
 *     writes 1 to this bit, RCRTO will be reset to 0. Part of LDF 0.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate read from rcr shadow ram generates a
 *     parity error Writing a 1 to this register also clears the
 *     rdcshadowParLog register Fatal error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate read from rbr prefetch ram generates
 *     parity error Writing a 1 to this register also clears the
 *     rdcPrefParLog register Fatal error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate Receive Block Ring prefetch is empty (not
 *     enough buffer blocks available depending on incoming pkt size)
 *     when hardware tries to queue a packet. Incoming packets will
 *     be discarded. Non-fatal error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate packet discard because of RCR shadow
 *     full. RCR Shadow full cannot be set to 1 in a normal
 *     operation. When set to 1, it indicates a fatal error. Part of
 *     LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate Receive Completion Ring full when
 *     hardware tries to enqueue the completion status of a packet.
 *     Incoming packets will be discarded. No buffer consumed. Fatal
 *     error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate RBR empty when hardware attempts to
 *     prefetch. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Set to 1 to indicate Receive Buffer Ring full when software
 *     writes the kick register with a value greater than the length
 *     of the RBR length. Incoming packets will be discarded. Fatal
 *     error. Part of LDF 1.
 *     Number of buffer pointers read. Used to advance the RCR head
 *     pointer.
 *     Number of packets read; when written to, decrement the QLEN
 *     counter by PKTREAD. QLEN is lower bounded to zero.
