        # 3 will set the 100 Mbps speed and half Duplex mode.

        # To advertise 10 Full only AutoNegAdvertised   =  2

MaxFrameSize=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0;
        # 0 is for normal ethernet frames.
        # 1 is for upto 4k size frames.

	#
	# These are maximum frame limits, not the ethernet payload size
	# (usually called MTU).  Your actual ethernet MTU is determined by frame
	# size limit and protocol stack configuration (please refer to ndd
	# command man pages)
	#
	# For Jumbo Frame Support (9k ethernet packet) use 3 (upto 16k size
	# frames).  On PCH adapter type (82577 and 82578) you can configure up
	# to 4k size frames.  The 4k size is only allowed at 1gig speed, so if
	# you select 4k frames size, you cannot force or autonegotiate the
	# 10/100 speed options.

SetMasterSlave=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0;
	# 0 sets to hardware default
	# 1 forces master
	# 2 forces slave
	# 3 forces auto
	# This setting controls the PHY master/slave setting. Manually forcing
	# master or slave can help reduce time to link with some switches
	# (Planex 08TX and IO Data switches).  It is recommended that this 
        # setting remain at the hardware default.
