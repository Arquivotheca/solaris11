# scsa2usb.conf file
#
#       WARNING: This is an UNSTABLE configuration file. Its contents
#               may change at any time.
#
# Records in this file may be used to override the vendor-supplied subclass
# and protocol values for USB mass storage devices. Note: only non-class-
# compliant values for subclass and protocol (e.g. 0xff) will be overridden.
# If a device supplies legal, class-compliant values for these fields, those
# values will not be overridden.
#
# Records in this file may also be used to override the default power
# management behavior of USB mass storage devices.
#
# A record in this file has the following format:-
# "vid=vId pid=pId rev=revision subclass=override protocol=override pm=pmvalue
#	removable=remvalue modesense=modesensevalue"
#
# where:
#	vId/pId/revision: are obtained from
#	'prtconf -v' output for the device
#
#	vendorId is the hardware property 'usb-vendor-id'
#	productId is the hardware property 'usb-product-id'
#	revision is the hardware property 'usb-revision-id'
#
#	subclass override - could be either "ufi", "scsi", or "atapi"
#		where	"ufi" -> Device follows UFI transport
#			"atapi" -> Device follows ATAPI transport
#			"scsi" -> Device follows SCSI transport
#
#	These values are part of USB Interface descriptor for that device.
#		bInterfaceSubClass	type
#		0x1			"scsi"
#		0x2			"atapi"
#		0x4			"ufi"
#		0x5			"atapi"
#		0x6			"scsi"
#
#	protocol override - could be either "cbi", "cb", or "bo"
#		where	"cbi" -> Control/Bulk/Interrupt device
#			"cb" -> Control/Bulk/Interrupt device with no
#				interrupt pipe status
#			"bo" -> Bulk Only device
#
#	These values are part of USB Interface descriptor for that device.
#		bInterfaceProtocol	type
#		0x0			"cbi"
#		0x1			"cb"
#		0x2			"bo" - zip protocol
#		0x50			"bo"
#
#	pmvalue - "off" if device is not to be power managed.
#		This is the only legal value for this parameter. 
#		This parameter is included because some devices
#		are not capable of being power-managed, i.e. they
#		will not respond after having their power lowered.
#		If this is the case, the device should have power
#		management disabled by setting this to "off".
#
#	remvalue - "true" if the device's removable media information
#		in its hardware inquiry data is to be overridden. This
#		is the only legal value for this parameter. 
#
#	NOTE: In previous releases, the removable media information 
#		was always overridden and the only legal value was "false". 
#
#		There is a removable media status bit in the USB storage
#		device's inquiry data to indicate if the device has a media
#		that can be removed. Usually only devices like floppy drives
#		or CD/DVD drives that really have a removable media can
#		have this bit set and be called removable media devices.
#		Solaris treats removable media devices and non-removable
#		media devices differently. Refer to "System	Administration
#		Guide: Devices and File Systems" - "Using USB Devices
#		(Tasks)" - "Using USB Mass Storage Devices" section for
#		the differences in system behavior of treating removable
#		media devices and non-removable	media devices.
#
#		By default, Solaris will treat USB storage devices as
#		removable media devices depending on the removable media
#		bit value. In some cases this may be undesirable and the
#		behavior of the previous releases should be preserved. In
#		this case the removable media bit value should be overridden.
#		By setting "remvalue" to "true", the information provided
#		by the device is ignored. Consequently a USB hard disk
#		is treated as a removable media disk and will not show in
#		format(1M) disk list.
#
#	modesensevalue - "false" if the device cannot handle mode sense
#		requests. This is the only legal value for this
#		parameter. Some devices choke on mode sense requests
#		and become unusable.
#
#	reduced-cmd-support	- "true" if the device cannot handle
#		mode sense, or start/stop, or doorlock, or doesn not
#		report correct residues on data transfers.
#		This is the only legal value for this parameter. This
#		setting is recommended for USB memory sticks and USB2.0
#		enclosures which may not be USB Mass Storage spec
#		compliant.
#
# NOTE: As a special case, "*" may be used as a wildcard which matches
#	any field. This is useful in situations where more than one
#	vendor produces a particular model of a product, one vendor
#	produces more than one product with the same characteristics,
#	or a product has more than one revision. The subclass and
#	protocol override values may also contain "*" if one or the
#	the other does not require an override value.
#
# For the properties to take effect, reboot the system.
#
# To create this list, first COPY the "attribute-override-list =" line
# to the end of the file and uncomment it.
#
# Then COPY sample records and uncomment them or create new records.
# The list consists of one or more records separated by commas and
# terminated by a semicolon.
#
# IMPORTANT: CREATE THE LIST BY ENTERING NEW RECORDS AFTER THE LAST LINE
# OF THE FILE. TO PREVENT CHANGES BEING LOST WHEN THIS FILE IS UPGRADED,
# DO NOT UNCOMMENT LINES "IN PLACE."
#
#attribute-override-list =
#
# for Sony DSC-S85 USB Digital camera:

#
# for SanDisk SDDR-05a CF:

#
# to apply to all USB Mass Storage devices:
