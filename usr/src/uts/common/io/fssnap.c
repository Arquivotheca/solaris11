/*
 * This module implements the file system snapshot code, which provides a
 * point-in-time image of a file system for the purposes of online backup.
 * There are essentially two parts to this project: the driver half and the
 * file system half.  The driver half is a pseudo device driver called
 * "fssnap" that represents the snapshot.  Each snapshot is assigned a
 * number that corresponds to the minor number of the device, and a control
 * device with a high minor number is used to initiate snapshot creation and
 * deletion.  For all practical purposes the driver half acts like a
 * read-only disk device whose contents are exactly the same as the master
 * file system at the time the snapshot was created.
 *
 * The file system half provides interfaces necessary for performing the
 * file system dependent operations required to create and delete snapshots
 * and a special driver strategy routine that must always be used by the file
 * system for snapshots to work correctly.
 *
 * When a snapshot is to be created, the user utility will send an ioctl to
 * the control device of the driver half specifying the file system to be
 * snapshotted, the file descriptor of a backing-store file which is used to
 * hold old data before it is overwritten, and other snapshot parameters.
 * This ioctl is passed on to the file system specified in the original
 * ioctl request.  The file system is expected to be able to flush
 * everything out to make the file system consistent and lock it to ensure
 * no changes occur while the snapshot is being created.  It then calls
 * fssnap_create() to create state for a new snapshot, from which an opaque
 * handle is returned with the snapshot locked.  Next, the file system must
 * populate the "candidate bitmap", which tells the snapshot code which
 * "chunks" should be considered for copy-on-write (a chunk is the unit of
 * granularity used for copy-on-write, which is independent of the device
 * and file system block sizes).  This is typically done by scanning the
 * file system allocation bitmaps to determine which chunks contain
 * allocated blocks in the file system at the time the snapshot was created.
 * If a chunk has no allocated blocks, it does not need to be copied before
 * being written to.  Once the candidate bitmap is populated with
 * fssnap_set_candidate(), the file system calls fssnap_create_done() to
 * complete the snapshot creation and unlock the snapshot.  The file system
 * may now be unlocked and modifications to it resumed.
 *
 * Once a snapshot is created, the file system must perform all writes
 * through a special strategy routine, fssnap_strategy().  This strategy
 * routine determines whether the chunks contained by the write must be
 * copied before being overwritten by consulting the candidate bitmap
 * described above, and the "hastrans bitmap" which tells it whether the chunk
 * has been copied already or not.  If the chunk is a candidate but has not
 * been copied, it reads the old data in and adds it to a queue.  The
 * old data can then be overwritten with the new data.  An asynchronous
 * task queue is dispatched for each old chunk read in which writes the old
 * data to the backing file specified at snapshot creation time.  The
 * backing file is a sparse file the same size as the file system that
 * contains the old data at the offset that data originally had in the
 * file system.  If the queue containing in-memory chunks gets too large,
 * writes to the file system may be throttled by a semaphore until the
 * task queues have a chance to push some of the chunks to the backing file.
 *
 * With the candidate bitmap, the hastrans bitmap, the data on the master
 * file system, and the old data in memory and in the backing file, the
 * snapshot pseudo-driver can piece together the original file system
 * information to satisfy read requests.  If the requested chunk is not a
 * candidate, it returns a zeroed buffer.  If the chunk is a candidate but
 * has not been copied it reads it from the master file system.  If it is a
 * candidate and has been copied, it either copies the data from the
 * in-memory queue or it reads it in from the backing file.  The result is
 * a replication of the original file system that can be backed up, mounted,
 * or manipulated by other file system utilities that work on a read-only
 * device.
 *
 * This module is divided into three roughly logical sections:
 *
 *     - The snapshot driver, which is a character/block driver
 *       representing the snapshot itself.  These routines are
 *       prefixed with "snap_".
 *
 *     - The library routines that are defined in fssnap_if.h that
 *       are used by file systems that use this snapshot implementation.
 *       These functions are prefixed with "fssnap_" and are called through
 *       a function vector from the file system.
 *
 *     - The helper routines used by the snapshot driver and the fssnap
 *       library routines for managing the translation table and other
 *       useful functions.  These routines are all static and are
 *       prefixed with either "fssnap_" or "transtbl_" if they
 *       are specifically used for translation table activities.

/*
 * Snapshot Driver Routines
 *
 * This section implements the snapshot character and block drivers.  The
 * device will appear to be a consistent read-only file system to
 * applications that wish to back it up or mount it.  The snapshot driver
 * communicates with the file system through the translation table, which
 * tells the snapshot driver where to find the data necessary to piece
 * together the frozen file system.  The data may either be on the master
 * device (no translation exists), in memory (a translation exists but has
 * not been flushed to the backing store), or in the backing store file.
 * The read request may require the snapshot driver to retrieve data from
 * several different places and piece it together to look like a single
 * contiguous read.
 *
 * The device minor number corresponds to the snapshot number in the list of
 * snapshot identifiers.  The soft state for each minor number is simply a
 * pointer to the snapshot id, which holds all of the snapshot state.  One
 * minor number is designated as the control device.  All snapshot create
 * and delete requests go through the control device to ensure this module
 * is properly loaded and attached before the file system starts calling
 * routines defined here.
