#
# The presence of the ac97-speaker property enables the use of a monoaural
# output, normally intended for use with a speaker phone.  Most systems
# do not connect this to anything.  The value of the property indicates
# whether the speaker will be enabled by default or not.
#
# ac97-speaker=0;

#
# Uncomment ac97-micboost below to enable the use of a 20dB microphone boost.
#
# ac97-micboost=1;

#
# Uncomment properties below to suppress the AC'97 outputs that are
# supported by the codec, but not connected to anything.  Note
# that the headphone feature in particular is commonly implemented as
# an alternate output for the line out, and uses that with jack detection
# instead of the codec's headphone feature.
#
# We don't allow diabling the lineout -- that's such a fundamental
# part of ac97 that we doubt any vendor isn't using it.
#
# ac97-no-headphone=1;
# ac97-no-auxout=1;

#
# Uncomment properties below to suppress the AC'97 inputs that are
# supported by the codec, but not connected to anything.  Note that
# CDROM input support is mandatory in AC'97, so all codecs implement
# it, even though many systems may not even have a CDROM installed.
#
# Generally, you can count on a linein and mic jack being present,
# although some Toshiba models have been seen that lack a line-level
# input jack.
#
# ac97-no-cdrom=1;
# ac97-no-auxin=1;
# ac97-no-video=1;
# ac97-no-phone=1;
# ac97-no-linein=1;
# ac97-no-mic=1;

#
# Uncomment ac97-amplifier below to power down the external
# amplifier. Most hardware doesn't need this property. But some
# devices, such as some Sony Vaio laptops, need to set this property to
# 0 to correct the inverted polarity of the external amplifier device.

# ac97-amplifier=0;
