/*
 * TXDMA_REG_WRITE64
 *
 *	Write a 64-bit value to a DMC register.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 	handle	The NPI handle to use.
 * 	offset	The offset into the DMA CSR (the register).
 * 	channel	The channel, which is used as a multiplicand.
 * 	value	The 64-bit value to write.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	For reference, here is the old macro:
 *
 *	#define	TXDMA_REG_WRITE64(handle, reg, channel, data)	\
 *			NXGE_REG_WR64(handle,			\
 *		NXGE_TXDMA_OFFSET(reg, handle.is_vraddr, channel), data)
 *
 *	If handle.regp is a virtual address (the address of a VR),
 *	we have to subtract the value DMC right off the bat.  DMC
 *	is defined as 0x600000, which works in a non-virtual address
 *	space, but not in a VR.  In a VR, a DMA CSR's space begins
 *	at zero (0).  So, since every call to RXMDA_REG_READ64 uses
 *	a register macro which adds in DMC, we have to subtract it.
 *
 *	The rest of it is pretty straighforward.  In a VR, a channel is
 *	logical, not absolute; and every DMA CSR is 512 bytes big;
 *	furthermore, a subpage of a VR is always ordered with the
 *	transmit CSRs first, followed by the receive CSRs.  That is,
 *	a 512 byte space of Tx CSRs, followed by a 512 byte space of
 *	Rx CSRs.  Hence this calculation:
 *
 *	offset += ((channel << 1) << DMA_CSR_SLL);
 *
 *	Here's an example:
 *
 *	TXDMA_REG_WRITE64(handle, TX_CS_REG, channel, value);
 *	Let's say channel is 3
 *	#define	TX_CS_REG		(DMC + 0x40028)
 *	offset = 0x640028
 *	offset &= 0xff = 0x28
 *	offset += ((3 << 1) << 9)
 *	3 << 1 = 6
 *	6 << 9 = 0xc00
 *	offset += 0xc00 = 0xc28
 *
 *	Therefore, our register's (virtual) PIO address is 0xc28.
 *
 *	cf. Table 10-6 on page 181 of the Neptune PRM, v 1.4:
 *
 *	C00 - dFF CSRs for bound logical transmit DMA channel 3.
 *
 *	In a non-virtual environment, you simply multiply the absolute
 *	channel number by 512 bytes, and get the correct offset to
 *	the register you're looking for.  That is, the RX_DMA_CTL_STAT CSR,
 *	is, as are all of these registers, in a table where each channel
 *	is offset 512 bytes from the previous channel (count 16 step 512).
 *
 *	offset += (channel << DMA_CSR_SLL);	// channel<<9 = channel*512
 *
 *	Here's an example:
 *
 *	TXDMA_REG_WRITE64(handle, TX_CS_REG, channel, value);
 *	Let's say channel is 3
 *	#define	TX_CS_REG		(DMC + 0x40028)
 *	offset = 0x640028
 *	offset += (3 << 9)
 *	3 << 9 = 0x600
 *	offset += 0x600 = 0x640628
 *
 *	Therefore, our register's PIO address is 0x640628.
 *
 *	cf. Table 13-15 on page 265 of the Neptune PRM, v 1.4:
 *	TX_CS (DMC + 4002816) (count 24 step 0x200)
 *
 * Context:
 *	Any domain
