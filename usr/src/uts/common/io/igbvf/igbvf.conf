# Driver.conf file for Intel 1Gb ethernet VF driver (igbvf)
#
# -------------------- Jumbo Frame --------------------
# default_mtu
#	The size of the default MTU (payload without the ethernet header)
#	Allowed values:	1500 - 9216
#	Default value:	1500
#
# default_mtu		= 1500;
#
# -------------------- Transmit/Receive Queues --------------------
#
# tx_ring_size
#	The number of the transmit descriptors per transmit queue
#	Allowed values:	64 - 4096
#	Default value:	512
#
# rx_ring_size
#	The number of the receive descriptors per receive queue
#	Allowed values:	64 - 4096
#	Default value:	512
#
# -------- How to set parameters for a particular interface ---------
# The example below shows how to locate the device path and set a parameter
# for a particular igbvf interface. (Using default_mtu as an example)
#
# Use the following command to find out the device paths for igbvf,
#       more /etc/path_to_inst | grep igbvf
#
# For example, if you see,
#	"/pci@0,0/pci8086,3408@1/pciex8086,10ca@10,1" 0 "igbvf"
#	"/pci@0,0/pci8086,3409@2/pciex8086,10ca@10" 1 "igbvf"
#
# name = "pciex8086,10ca" parent = "/pci@0,0/pci8086,3408@1" unit-address = "10,1"
# default_mtu = 1500;
# name = "pciex8086,10ca" parent = "/pci@0,0/pci8086,3409@2" unit-address = "10"
# default_mtu = 9000;
