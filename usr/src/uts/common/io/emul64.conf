# Define Different emul64 HBA instances and children:
#
#	We don't define HBAs by default, other tests that live under pshot
#	(like the devfs testsuite) will fail if emul64 is enabled by default.
#	The test scripts that use emul64 should enable the required 
#	emul64.conf configuration (and restore a disabled emul64.conf).
#
# 	NOTE:	As of %E% the sd target driver does not support
#		devices >= 2TB. If you configure one format will
#		complain:
#			The capacity of this LUN is too large.
#			Reconfigure this LUN so that it is < 2TB.
#
#	Example:
#
#name="emul64" parent="pshot" bus-addr="1"
#	targ_0_0=	"wombat-drive-1GB",	"WOMBAT  1_0_0:1GB";
#
#name="emul64" parent="pshot" bus-addr="2"
#	targ_0_0=	"wombat-drive-1TB",	"WOMBAT  2_0_0:1TB"
#	targ_1_0=	"wombat-drive-1_5TB",	"WOMBAT  2_1_0:1.5TB";
#


#
# The following properties can be used to override tunables in the emul64
# driver.
#
#	emul64_collect_stats	0 means do not collect statistics.
#				Non-zero means to collect statistics.
#				Default value is 1.
#
#	emul64_yield_enable	Non-zero means that emul64 should
#				periodically yield the CPU to allow other
#				activities to happen.  Default value is 1.
#
#	emul64_yield_period	Number of emul64 I/O operation between
#				yields of the CPU.  Default is 1000.
#
#	emul64_yield_length	Amount of time in microseconds that emul64
#				should yield the CPU during its periodic
#				yields.  Default is 1000.
#
#	emul64_max_task		Maximum number of task elements in the task
#				queue for each emul64 controller.  Default
#				is 16.
#
#	emul64_task_nthreads	Specifies the number of threads that should
#				be used to process a controller's task
#				queue.  By default this is set at run time
#				to the number of CPUs on the system.  It
#				should probably only be set in this file
#				for special purposes.
#
# The driver has the default values preset, so it is only necessary to
# define these properties in this file if you wish to override the default
# values.  The following commented lines can be used as a prototype for
# setting the properties.
#
#emul64_collect_stats=1;
#emul64_yield_enable=1;
#emul64_yield_period=1000;
#emul64_yield_length=1000;
#emul64_max_task=16;
#emul64_task_nthreads=<ncpu>;
