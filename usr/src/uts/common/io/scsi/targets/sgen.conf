# WARNING: enabling this driver may impact the security and data integrity of
# devices on your system.  Please refer to sgen(7d) for details.
#
# There are two ways of configuring sgen: by establishing an association
# between a compatible alias for a device and the sgen driver via
# "add_drv -i", or by using this file (sgen.conf).

#--------------------------add_drv binding method-----------------------------
# SCSI target devices are now self-identifying in Solaris. Add_drv is the
# preferred method to control driver binding, it avoids issues associated
# with multiple driver.conf files associating more than one driver with a
# device. The compatible property forms for SCSI target devices used in the
# add_drv command are described in scsi(4).
#
# USAGE EXAMPLE (add_drv)
#
# In this example, sgen is configured to bind to all scanner and ocrw devices
# in the system, as well as the UltraToast 4000 disk from ACME using the
# add_drv configuration method.
#
# add_drv -i \
#    '"scsiclass,06" "scsiclass,0f" "scsiclass,00.vACME,pUltraToast_4000"' sgen

#-------------------------sgen.conf binding method----------------------------
# NOTE: Support for sgen.conf configuration may be removed in a future release
# of Solaris. 
#
# The the remainder of this file is concerned with the .conf file 
# configuration method. Sgen may be configured to bind to SCSI devices
# exporting a particular device type, using the device-type-config-list, which
# is a ',' delimited list of strings.
#
#device-type-config-list=
#	"direct"		(type 0x00)
#	"sequential"		(type 0x01)
#	"printer"		(type 0x02)
#	"processor"		(type 0x03)
#	"worm"			(type 0x04)
#	"rodirect"		(type 0x05)
#	"scanner"		(type 0x06)
#	"optical"		(type 0x07)
#	"changer"		(type 0x08)
#	"comm"			(type 0x09)
#	"prepress1"		(type 0x0A)
#	"prepress2"		(type 0x0B)
#	"array_ctrl"		(type 0x0C)
#	"ses"			(type 0x0D)
#	"rbc"			(type 0x0E)
#	"ocrw"			(type 0x0F)
#	"bridge"		(type 0x10)
#	"type_0x<typenum>"	(types 0x11-0x1e are undefined by SCSI-3)
#	"type_unknown"		(type 0x1f)
#
# In addition to binding to device types, sgen can be configured to bind to one
# or more particular devices.  The latter is accomplished by specifying the
# Vendor and Product IDs returned by the device in response to the SCSI INQUIRY
# command.  This is accomplished by specifying pairs of Vendor ID and Product ID
# strings in the inquiry-config-list property, below.  "*" may be substituted
# for the vendor ID as a wildcard.  See sgen(7D) for details and extended usage
# examples.
#
# USAGE EXAMPLE (sgen.conf)
#
# In this example, sgen is configured to bind to all scanner and ocrw devices in
# the system, as well as the UltraToast 4000 from ACME, and the PowerToast
# series of devices, regardless of vendor.
#
#device-type-config-list="scanner", "ocrw";
#
#inquiry-config-list=	"ACME",		"UltraToast 4000",
#			"*",		"PowerToast";
#
# When using the sgen.conf method, after configuring the
# device-type-config-list and/or the inquiry-config-list, the administrator
# must uncomment those target/lun pairs at which there are devices for sgen to
# control.  If it is expected that devices controlled by sgen will be hotplugged
# or added into the system later, it is recommended that all of the following
# lines be uncommented.
