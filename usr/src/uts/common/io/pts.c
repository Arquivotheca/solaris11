/*
 * Pseudo Terminal Slave Driver.
 *
 * The pseudo-tty subsystem simulates a terminal connection, where the master
 * side represents the terminal and the slave represents the user process's
 * special device end point. The master device is set up as a cloned device
 * where its major device number is the major for the clone device and its minor
 * device number is the major for the ptm driver. There are no nodes in the file
 * system for master devices. The master pseudo driver is opened using the
 * open(2) system call with /dev/ptmx as the device parameter.  The clone open
 * finds the next available minor device for the ptm major device.
 *
 * A master device is available only if it and its corresponding slave device
 * are not already open. When the master device is opened, the corresponding
 * slave device is automatically locked out. Only one open is allowed on a
 * master device.  Multiple opens are allowed on the slave device.  After both
 * the master and slave have been opened, the user has two file descriptors
 * which are the end points of a full duplex connection composed of two streams
 * which are automatically connected at the master and slave drivers. The user
 * may then push modules onto either side of the stream pair.
 *
 * The master and slave drivers pass all messages to their adjacent queues.
 * Only the M_FLUSH needs some processing.  Because the read queue of one side
 * is connected to the write queue of the other, the FLUSHR flag is changed to
 * the FLUSHW flag and vice versa. When the master device is closed an M_HANGUP
 * message is sent to the slave device which will render the device
 * unusable. The process on the slave side gets the EIO when attempting to write
 * on that stream but it will be able to read any data remaining on the stream
 * head read queue.  When all the data has been read, read() returns 0
 * indicating that the stream can no longer be used.  On the last close of the
 * slave device, a 0-length message is sent to the master device. When the
 * application on the master side issues a read() or getmsg() and 0 is returned,
 * the user of the master device decides whether to issue a close() that
 * dismantles the pseudo-terminal subsystem. If the master device is not closed,
 * the pseudo-tty subsystem will be available to another user to open the slave
 * device.
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *
 *   All global data synchronization between ptm/pts is done via global
 *   ptms_lock mutex which is initialized at system boot time from
 *   ptms_initspace (called from space.c).
 *
 *   Individual fields of pt_ttys structure (except ptm_rdq, pts_rdq and
 *   pt_nullmsg) are protected by pt_ttys.pt_lock mutex.
 *
 *   PT_ENTER_READ/PT_ENTER_WRITE are reference counter based read-write locks
 *   which allow reader locks to be reacquired by the same thread (usual
 *   reader/writer locks can't be used for that purpose since it is illegal for
 *   a thread to acquire a lock it already holds, even as a reader). The sole
 *   purpose of these macros is to guarantee that the peer queue will not
 *   disappear (due to closing peer) while it is used. It is safe to use
 *   PT_ENTER_READ/PT_EXIT_READ brackets across calls like putq/putnext (since
 *   they are not real locks but reference counts).
 *
 *   PT_ENTER_WRITE/PT_EXIT_WRITE brackets are used ONLY in master/slave
 *   open/close paths to modify ptm_rdq and pts_rdq fields. These fields should
 *   be set to appropriate queues *after* qprocson() is called during open (to
 *   prevent peer from accessing the queue with incomplete plumbing) and set to
 *   NULL before qprocsoff() is called during close.
 *
 *   The pt_nullmsg field is only used in open/close routines and it is also
 *   protected by PT_ENTER_WRITE/PT_EXIT_WRITE brackets to avoid extra mutex
 *   holds.
 *
 * Lock Ordering:
 *
 *   If both ptms_lock and per-pty lock should be held, ptms_lock should always
 *   be entered first, followed by per-pty lock.
 *
 * See ptms.h, ptm.c and ptms_conf.c fore more information.
