 * hci1394_async_atreq_process()
 *    Process an atreq, if one has completed. This is called during interrupt
 *    processing and will process a completed atreq. It returns status if an
 *    atreq was processed so that the ISR knows that it needs to be called
 *    again to see if another ATREQ has completed. flush_q set to B_TRUE tells
 *    this routine to process all commands regardless of their completion
 *    status.  This is used during bus reset processing to remove all commands
 *    from the Q.
 *
 *    There are a few race conditions that we have to watch for in atreq/arresp.
 *    They all have to do with pended responses so they are not applicable in
 *    the ARREQ/ATRESP engine (since ATRESP's can't be pended).
 *
 *    Since the race conditions only exist for pended responses, we will only
 *    talk about that sequence here. We're also going to simplify the discussion
 *    so what the code does, so it won't exactly match what we say (e.g. we
 *    don't always setup a timeout for every single command, etc.)
 *
 *    After Q'ing up an ATREQ, we will process the result of that command in
 *    one of a couple different paths. A normal condition would be that we Q up
 *    a command, we get an ATREQ complete interrupt and look at the ATREQ
 *    result. In the case it has been pended, we setup a timeout to wait for the
 *    response. If we receive the response before the timeout, the command is
 *    done and we send the response up the chain, if we do not, the command is
 *    done and we send a timeout notification up the chain.
 *
 *    The first race condition is when we get the timeout at the same time as
 *    the response. At first glance a mutex around the command state would
 *    solve this problem. But on a multi-processor machine, we may have the
 *    ARRESP interrupt handler(ISR) running on one processor and the timeout on
 *    another. This means that the command state could change between two
 *    reads while in the ISR. This means we need to have a little more complex
 *    logic around changing the command state and have to be careful how and
 *    when we do this.
 *
 *    The second race condition is that we could see the ARRESP before we
 *    process the ATREQ. We could be processing a few ARRESP from previous
 *    ATREQ's when the ATREQ completes and then the ARRESP comes in.  Since we
 *    already are in the interrupt handler, the ATREQ complete will not preempt
 *    us.
 *
 *    We will never see a race condition between the ATREQ interrupt for a
 *    command and the pending timeout since the command is not being timed until
 *    this routine is run for that command.
