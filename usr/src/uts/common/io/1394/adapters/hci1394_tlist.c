/*
 * hci1394_tlist.c
 *   This implements a timed double linked list.
 *   This list supports:
 *	- addition of node to the end of the list
 *	- atomic deletion of node anywhere in list
 *	- get and remove node from head of list
 *	- enable/disable of timeout feature
 *	- timeout feature, if enabled, will remove each node on the list which
 *	  has been on the list for > timeout.  The callback provided will be
 *	  called for each node removed. The worst case time is around
 *	  timer_resolution after the timeout has occurred (i.e. if you set the
 *	  timer resolution to 50uS and the timeout to 100uS, you could get the
 *	  callback anywhere from 100uS to 150uS from when you added the node to
 *	  the list.  This is a general statement and ignores things like
 *	  interrupt latency, context switching, etc.  So if you see a time
 *	  around 155uS, don't complain :-)
 *	- The timer is only used when something is on the list
