/*
 * PSARC 2004/405 made hat_getkpfnum(9F) obsolete. As part of the
 * obsolecense, the original documented behavior will begin to be
 * enforced in the future; namely, hat_getkpfnum(9F) may _only_
 * be called with device-mapped memory virtual addresses. Since
 * changing hat_getkpfnum(9F) to return PFN_INVALID on kernel memory
 * would break a lot of modules without any warning, we've implemented
 * the following mechanism as a stop-gap. In a future release, this
 * can all be ripped out and hat_getkpfnum(9F) changed to return
 * PFN_INVALID if it isn't called with a device-mapped memory address.
 *
 * We keep track of each module that has used hat_getkpfnum(9F)
 * incorrectly. This allows us to avoid flooding the console/logs
 * with too many warnings about a bad module that has already been
 * flagged.
 *
 * On amd64 hat_getkpfnum() is never supported.
