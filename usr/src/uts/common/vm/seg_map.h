/*
 * These are the forcefault flags used on getmapflt.
 *
 * The orginal semantic was extended to allow using the segkpm mapping
 * scheme w/o a major segmap interface change for MAXBSIZE == PAGESIZE
 * (which is required to enable segkpm for MAXBSIZE > PAGESIZE).
 * Most segmap consumers needn't to be changed at all or only need to
 * be changed slightly to take advantage of segkpm. Because the segkpm
 * virtual address is based on the physical address of a page, a page is
 * required to determine the virtual address (return value). Pages mapped
 * with segkpm are always at least read locked and are hence protected
 * from pageout or fsflush from segmap_getmap until segmap_release. This
 * implies, that the segkpm mappings are locked within this period too.
 * No trap driven segmap_fault's are possible in segkpm mode.
 *
 * The following combinations of "forcefault" and "rw" allow segkpm mode.
 * (1) SM_FAULT, S_READ
 * (2) SM_FAULT, S_WRITE
 * (3) SM_PAGECREATE, S_WRITE
 * (4) SM_LOCKPROTO, {S_READ, S_WRITE, S_OTHER}
 *
 * The regular additional operations (come in pairs in most of the cases):
 * . segmap_pagecreate/segmap_pageunlock
 * . segmap_fault(F_SOFTLOCK)/segmap_fault(F_SOFTUNLOCK)
 *
 * are mostly a no-op in segkpm mode with the following exceptions:
 * . The "newpage" return value of segmap_pagecreate is still supported
 *   for zeroout operations needed on newly created pages.
 *
 * . segmap_fault() must follow when a error could be expected in
 *   the VOP_GETPAGE. In segkpm mode this error is recognized in
 *   segmap_getmapflt and returned from the following segmap_fault()
 *   call. The "hole" optimization (read only after first VOP_GETPAGE
 *   mapping in segmap_getmapflt followed by a trap driven protection
 *   fault and a second VOP_GETPAGE via segmap_fault) cannot be used.
 *
 * . segmap_fault(F_SOFTUNLOCK) must follow when segmap_getmapflt was
 *   called w/ (SM_LOCKPROTO, S_OTHER). S_WRITE has to be applied, when
 *   the page should be marked "dirty". Otherwise the page is not
 *   written to the backing store later (as mentioned above, no page
 *   or protection faults are possible in segkpm mode). Caller cannot
 *   use only S_OTHER and rely on a protection fault to force the page
 *   to become dirty.
 *
 * . The segmap_pagecreate parameter softlock is ignored, pages and
 *   mappings are locked anyway.
 *
 * SM_LOCKPROTO is used in the fbio layer and some special segmap consumers.
