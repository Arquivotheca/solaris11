/*
 * Each physical page has a page structure, which is used to maintain
 * these pages as a cache.  A page can be found via a hashed lookup
 * based on the [vp, offset].  If a page has an [vp, offset] identity,
 * then it is entered on a doubly linked circular list off the
 * vnode using the vpnext/vpprev pointers.   If the p_free bit
 * is on, then the page is also on a doubly linked circular free
 * list using next/prev pointers.  If the "p_selock" and "p_iolock"
 * are held, then the page is currently being read in (exclusive p_selock)
 * or written back (shared p_selock).  In this case, the next/prev pointers
 * are used to link the pages together for a consecutive i/o request.  If
 * the page is being brought in from its backing store, then other processes
 * will wait for the i/o to complete before attaching to the page since it
 * will have an "exclusive" lock.
 *
 * Each page structure has the locks described below along with
 * the fields they protect:
 *
 *	p_selock	This is a per-page shared/exclusive lock that is
 *			used to implement the logical shared/exclusive
 *			lock for each page.  The "shared" lock is normally
 *			used in most cases while the "exclusive" lock is
 *			required to destroy or retain exclusive access to
 *			a page (e.g., while reading in pages).  The appropriate
 *			lock is always held whenever there is any reference
 *			to a page structure (e.g., during i/o).
 *			(Note that with the addition of the "writer-lock-wanted"
 *			semantics (via SE_EWANTED), threads must not acquire
 *			multiple reader locks or else a deadly embrace will
 *			occur in the following situation: thread 1 obtains a
 *			reader lock; next thread 2 fails to get a writer lock
 *			but specified SE_EWANTED so it will wait by either
 *			blocking (when using page_lock_es) or spinning while
 *			retrying (when using page_try_reclaim_lock) until the
 *			reader lock is released; then thread 1 attempts to
 *			get another reader lock but is denied due to
 *			SE_EWANTED being set, and now both threads are in a
 *			deadly embrace.)
 *
 *				p_hash
 *				p_vnode
 *				p_offset
 *
 *				p_free
 *				p_age
 *
 *	p_iolock	This is a binary semaphore lock that provides
 *			exclusive access to the i/o list links in each
 *			page structure.  It is always held while the page
 *			is on an i/o list (i.e., involved in i/o).  That is,
 *			even though a page may be only `shared' locked
 *			while it is doing a write, the following fields may
 *			change anyway.  Normally, the page must be
 *			`exclusively' locked to change anything in it.
 *
 *				p_next
 *				p_prev
 *
 * The following fields are protected by the global page_llocks[]:
 *
 *				p_lckcnt
 *				p_cowcnt
 *
 * The following lists are protected by the global page_freelock:
 *
 *				page_cachelist
 *				page_freelist
 *
 * The following, for our purposes, are protected by
 * the global freemem_lock:
 *
 *				freemem
 *				freemem_wait
 *				freemem_cv
 *
 * The following fields are protected by hat layer lock(s).  When a page
 * structure is not mapped and is not associated with a vnode (after a call
 * to page_hashout() for example) the p_nrm field may be modified with out
 * holding the hat layer lock:
 *
 *				p_nrm
 *				p_mapping
 *				p_share
 *
 * The following field is file system dependent.  How it is used and
 * the locking strategies applied are up to the individual file system
 * implementation.
 *
 *				p_fsdata
 *
 * The page structure is used to represent and control the system's
 * physical pages.  There is one instance of the structure for each
 * page that is not permenately allocated.  For example, the pages that
 * hold the page structures are permanently held by the kernel
 * and hence do not need page structures to track them.  The array
 * of page structures is allocated early on in the kernel's life and
 * is based on the amount of available physical memory.
 *
 * Each page structure may simultaneously appear on several linked lists.
 * The lists are:  hash list, free or in i/o list, and a vnode's page list.
 * Each type of list is protected by a different group of mutexes as described
 * below:
 *
 * The hash list is used to quickly find a page when the page's vnode and
 * offset within the vnode are known.  Each page that is hashed is
 * connected via the `p_hash' field.  The anchor for each hash is in the
 * array `page_hash'.  An array of mutexes, `ph_mutex', protects the
 * lists anchored by page_hash[].  To either search or modify a given hash
 * list, the appropriate mutex in the ph_mutex array must be held.
 *
 * The free list contains pages that are `free to be given away'.  For
 * efficiency reasons, pages on this list are placed in two catagories:
 * pages that are still associated with a vnode, and pages that are not
 * associated with a vnode.  Free pages always have their `p_free' bit set,
 * free pages that are still associated with a vnode also have their
 * `p_age' bit set.  Pages on the free list are connected via their
 * `p_next' and `p_prev' fields.  When a page is involved in some sort
 * of i/o, it is not free and these fields may be used to link associated
 * pages together.  At the moment, the free list is protected by a
 * single mutex `page_freelock'.  The list of free pages still associated
 * with a vnode is anchored by `page_cachelist' while other free pages
 * are anchored in architecture dependent ways (to handle page coloring etc.).
 *
 * Pages associated with a given vnode appear on a list anchored in the
 * vnode by the `v_pages' field.  They are linked together with
 * `p_vpnext' and `p_vpprev'.  The field `p_offset' contains a page's
 * offset within the vnode.  The pages on this list are not kept in
 * offset order.  These lists, in a manner similar to the hash lists,
 * are protected by an array of mutexes called `vph_hash'.  Before
 * searching or modifying this chain the appropriate mutex in the
 * vph_hash[] array must be held.
 *
 * Again, each of the lists that a page can appear on is protected by a
 * mutex.  Before reading or writing any of the fields comprising the
 * list, the appropriate lock must be held.  These list locks should only
 * be held for very short intervals.
 *
 * In addition to the list locks, each page structure contains a
 * shared/exclusive lock that protects various fields within it.
 * To modify one of these fields, the `p_selock' must be exclusively held.
 * To read a field with a degree of certainty, the lock must be at least
 * held shared.
 *
 * Removing a page structure from one of the lists requires holding
 * the appropriate list lock and the page's p_selock.  A page may be
 * prevented from changing identity, being freed, or otherwise modified
 * by acquiring p_selock shared.
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, a strict locking protocol must be followed.  Basically
 * there are two cases:  In the first case, the page structure in question
 * is known ahead of time (e.g., when the page is to be added or removed
 * from a list).  In the second case, the page structure is not known and
 * must be found by searching one of the lists.
 *
 * When adding or removing a known page to one of the lists, first the
 * page must be exclusively locked (since at least one of its fields
 * will be modified), second the lock protecting the list must be acquired,
 * third the page inserted or deleted, and finally the list lock dropped.
 *
 * The more interesting case occures when the particular page structure
 * is not known ahead of time.  For example, when a call is made to
 * page_lookup(), it is not known if a page with the desired (vnode and
 * offset pair) identity exists.  So the appropriate mutex in ph_mutex is
 * acquired, the hash list searched, and if the desired page is found
 * an attempt is made to lock it.  The attempt to acquire p_selock must
 * not block while the hash list lock is held.  A deadlock could occure
 * if some other process was trying to remove the page from the list.
 * The removing process (following the above protocol) would have exclusively
 * locked the page, and be spinning waiting to acquire the lock protecting
 * the hash list.  Since the searching process holds the hash list lock
 * and is waiting to acquire the page lock, a deadlock occurs.
 *
 * The proper scheme to follow is: first, lock the appropriate list,
 * search the list, and if the desired page is found either use
 * page_trylock() (which will not block) or pass the address of the
 * list lock to page_lock().  If page_lock() can not acquire the page's
 * lock, it will drop the list lock before going to sleep.  page_lock()
 * returns a value to indicate if the list lock was dropped allowing the
 * calling program to react appropriately (i.e., retry the operation).
 *
 * If the list lock was dropped before the attempt at locking the page
 * was made, checks would have to be made to ensure that the page had
 * not changed identity before its lock was obtained.  This is because
 * the interval between dropping the list lock and acquiring the page
 * lock is indeterminate.
 *
 * In addition, when both a hash list lock (ph_mutex[]) and a vnode list
 * lock (vph_mutex[]) are needed, the hash list lock must be acquired first.
 * The routine page_hashin() is a good example of this sequence.
 * This sequence is ASSERTed by checking that the vph_mutex[] is not held
 * just before each acquisition of one of the mutexs in ph_mutex[].
 *
 * So, as a quick summary:
 *
 * 	pse_mutex[]'s protect the p_selock and p_cv fields.
 *
 * 	p_selock protects the p_free, p_age, p_vnode, p_offset and p_hash,
 *
 * 	ph_mutex[]'s protect the page_hash[] array and its chains.
 *
 * 	vph_mutex[]'s protect the v_pages field and the vp page chains.
 *
 *	First lock the page, then the hash chain, then the vnode chain.  When
 *	this is not possible `trylocks' must be used.  Sleeping while holding
 *	any of these mutexes (p_selock is not a mutex) is not allowed.

 *
 * Page relocation, PG_NORELOC and P_NORELOC.
 *
 * Pages may be relocated using the page_relocate() interface. Relocation
 * involves moving the contents and identity of a page to another, free page.
 * To relocate a page, the SE_EXCL lock must be obtained. The way to prevent
 * a page from being relocated is to hold the SE_SHARED lock (the SE_EXCL
 * lock must not be held indefinitely). If the page is going to be held
 * SE_SHARED indefinitely, then the PG_NORELOC hint should be passed
 * to page_create_va so that pages that are prevented from being relocated
 * can be managed differently by the platform specific layer.
 *
 * Pages locked in memory using page_pp_lock (p_lckcnt/p_cowcnt != 0)
 * are guaranteed to be held in memory, but can still be relocated
 * providing the SE_EXCL lock can be obtained.
 *
 * The P_NORELOC bit in the page_t.p_state field is provided for use by
 * the platform specific code in managing pages when the PG_NORELOC
 * hint is used.
 *
 * Memory delete and page locking.
 *
 * The set of all usable pages is managed using the global page list as
 * implemented by the memseg structure defined below. When memory is added
 * or deleted this list changes. Additions to this list guarantee that the
 * list is never corrupt.  In order to avoid the necessity of an additional
 * lock to protect against failed accesses to the memseg being deleted and,
 * more importantly, the page_ts, the memseg structure is never freed and the
 * page_t virtual address space is remapped to a page (or pages) of
 * zeros.  If a page_t is manipulated while it is p_selock'd, or if it is
 * locked indirectly via a hash or freelist lock, it is not possible for
 * memory delete to collect the page and so that part of the page list is
 * prevented from being deleted. If the page is referenced outside of one
 * of these locks, it is possible for the page_t being referenced to be
 * deleted.  Examples of this are page_t pointers returned by
 * page_numtopp_nolock, page_first and page_next.  Providing the page_t
 * is re-checked after taking the p_selock (for p_vnode != NULL), the
 * remapping to the zero pages will be detected.
 *
 *
 * Page size (p_szc field) and page locking.
 *
 * p_szc field of free pages is changed by free list manager under freelist
 * locks and is of no concern to the rest of VM subsystem.
 *
 * p_szc changes of allocated anonymous (swapfs) can only be done only after
 * exclusively locking all constituent pages and calling hat_pageunload() on
 * each of them. To prevent p_szc changes of non free anonymous (swapfs) large
 * pages it's enough to either lock SHARED any of constituent pages or prevent
 * hat_pageunload() by holding hat level lock that protects mapping lists (this
 * method is for hat code only)
 *
 * To increase (promote) p_szc of allocated non anonymous file system pages
 * one has to first lock exclusively all involved constituent pages and call
 * hat_pageunload() on each of them. To prevent p_szc promote it's enough to
 * either lock SHARED any of constituent pages that will be needed to make a
 * large page or prevent hat_pageunload() by holding hat level lock that
 * protects mapping lists (this method is for hat code only).
 *
 * To decrease (demote) p_szc of an allocated non anonymous file system large
 * page one can either use the same method as used for changeing p_szc of
 * anonymous large pages or if it's not possible to lock all constituent pages
 * exclusively a different method can be used. In the second method one only
 * has to exclusively lock one of constituent pages but then one has to
 * acquire further locks by calling page_szc_lock() and
 * hat_page_demote(). hat_page_demote() acquires hat level locks and then
 * demotes the page. This mechanism relies on the fact that any code that
 * needs to prevent p_szc of a file system large page from changeing either
 * locks all constituent large pages at least SHARED or locks some pages at
 * least SHARED and calls page_szc_lock() or uses hat level page locks.
 * Demotion using this method is implemented by page_demote_vp_pages().
 * Please see comments in front of page_demote_vp_pages(), hat_page_demote()
 * and page_szc_lock() for more details.
 *
 * Lock order: p_selock, page_szc_lock, ph_mutex/vph_mutex/freelist,
 * hat level locks.

 * Flags for page_t p_toxic, for tracking memory hardware errors.
 *
 * These flags are OR'ed into p_toxic with page_settoxic() to track which
 * error(s) have occurred on a given page. The flags are cleared with
 * page_clrtoxic(). Both page_settoxic() and page_cleartoxic use atomic
 * primitives to manipulate the p_toxic field so no other locking is needed.
 *
 * When an error occurs on a page, p_toxic is set to record the error. The
 * error could be a memory error or something else (i.e. a datapath). The Page
 * Retire mechanism does not try to determine the exact cause of the error;
 * Page Retire rightly leaves that sort of determination to FMA's Diagnostic
 * Engine (DE).
 *
 * Note that, while p_toxic bits can be set without holding any locks, they
 * should only be cleared while holding the page exclusively locked.
 * There is one exception to this, the PR_CAPTURE bit is protected by a mutex
 * within the page capture logic and thus to set or clear the bit, that mutex
 * needs to be held.  The page does not need to be locked but the page_clrtoxic
 * function must be used as we need an atomic operation.
 * Also note that there is what amounts to a hack to prevent recursion with
 * large pages such that if we are unlocking a page and the PR_CAPTURE bit is
 * set, we will only try to capture the page if the current threads T_CAPTURING
 * flag is not set.  If the flag is set, the unlock will not try to capture
 * the page even though the PR_CAPTURE bit is set.
 *
 * Pages with PR_UE or PR_FMA flags are retired unconditionally, while pages
 * with PR_MCE are retired if the system has not retired too many of them.
 *
 * A page must be exclusively locked to be retired. Pages can be retired if
 * they are mapped, modified, or both, as long as they are not marked PR_UE,
 * since pages with uncorrectable errors cannot be relocated in memory.
 * Once a page has been successfully retired it is zeroed, attached to the
 * retired_pages vnode and, finally, PR_RETIRED is set in p_toxic. The other
 * p_toxic bits are NOT cleared. Pages are not left locked after retiring them
 * to avoid special case code throughout the kernel; rather, page_*lock() will
 * fail to lock the page, unless SE_RETIRED is passed as an argument.
 *
 * While we have your attention, go take a look at the comments at the

/*
 * page capture related info:
 * The page capture routines allow us to asynchronously capture given pages
 * for the explicit use of the requestor.  New requestors can be added by
 * explicitly adding themselves to the PC_* flags below and incrementing
 * PC_NUM_CALLBACKS as necessary.
 *
 * Subsystems using page capture must register a callback before attempting
 * to capture a page.  A duration of -1 will indicate that we will never give
 * up while trying to capture a page and will only stop trying to capture the
 * given page once we have successfully captured it.  Thus the user needs to be
 * aware of the behavior of all callers who have a duration of -1.
 *
 * For now, only /dev/physmem and page retire use the page capture interface
 * and only a single request can be outstanding for a given page.  Thus, if
 * /dev/phsymem wants a page and page retire also wants the same page, only
 * the page retire request will be honored until the point in time that the
 * page is actually retired, at which point in time, subsequent requests by
 * /dev/physmem will succeed if the CAPTURE_GET_RETIRED flag was set.
