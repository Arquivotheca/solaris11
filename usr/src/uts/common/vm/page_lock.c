 * In this case, when an exclusive lock cannot be acquired, p_selock's

 *
 * The se and es parameters determine if the lock should be granted

 * Lock wanted   es flags     p_selock/SE_EWANTED  Action
 * ----------- -------------- -------------------  ---------
 * SE_EXCL        any [1][2]   unlocked/any        grant lock, clear SE_EWANTED

 * SE_SHARED      n/a              excl/any        deny
 *
 * Notes:
 * [1] The code grants an exclusive lock to the caller and clears the bit
 *   SE_EWANTED whenever p_selock is unlocked, regardless of the SE_EWANTED
 *   bit's value.  This was deemed acceptable as we are not concerned about
 *   exclusive-lock starvation. If this ever becomes an issue, a priority or
 *   fifo mechanism should also be implemented. Meantime, the thread that
 *   set SE_EWANTED should be prepared to catch this condition and reset it
 *
 * [2] Retired pages may not be locked at any time, regardless of the
 *   dispostion of se, unless the es parameter has SE_RETIRED flag set.
 *
 * Notes on values of "es":
 *
 *   es & 1: page_lookup_create will attempt page relocation
 *   es & SE_EXCL_WANTED: caller wants SE_EWANTED set (eg. delete
 *       memory thread); this prevents reader-starvation of waiting
 *       writer thread(s) by giving priority to writers over readers.
 *   es & SE_RETIRED: caller wants to lock pages even if they are
 *       retired.  Default is to deny the lock if the page is retired.
 *
 * And yes, we know, the semantics of this function are too complicated.
 * It's on the list to be cleaned up.
