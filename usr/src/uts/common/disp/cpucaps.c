/*
 * CPU Caps implementation
 * =======================
 *
 * A CPU cap can be set on any project or any zone. Zone CPU cap limits the CPU
 * usage for all projects running inside the zone. If the zone CPU cap is set
 * below the project CPU cap, the latter will have no effect.
 *
 * When CPU usage of projects and/or zones reaches specified caps, threads in
 * them do not get scheduled and instead are placed on wait queues associated
 * with a cap. Such threads will start running again only when CPU usage drops
 * below the cap level. Each zone and each project has its own wait queue.
 *
 * When CPU cap is set, the kernel continously keeps track of CPU time used by
 * capped zones and/or projects over a short time interval and calculates their
 * current CPU usage as a percentage. When the accumulated usage reaches the CPU
 * cap, LWPs running in the user-land (when they are not holding any critical
 * kernel locks) are placed on special wait queues until their project's or
 * zone's CPU usage drops below the cap.
 *
 * The system maintains a list of all capped projects and all capped zones. On
 * every clock tick every active thread belonging to a capped project adds its
 * CPU usage to its project. Usage from all projects belonging to a capped zone
 * is aggregated to get the zone usage.
 *
 * When the current CPU usage is above the cap, a project or zone is considered
 * over-capped. Every user thread caught running in an over-capped project or
 * zone is marked by setting TS_PROJWAITQ flag in thread's t_schedflag field and
 * is requested to surrender its CPU. This causes scheduling class specific
 * CL_PREEMPT() callback to be invoked. The callback function places threads
 * marked as TS_PROJWAIT on a wait queue and calls switch().
 *
 * Threads are only placed on wait queues after trapping from user-land
 * (they could be holding some user locks, but no kernel locks) and while
 * returning from the trap back to the user-land when no kernel locks are held.
 * Putting threads on wait queues in random places while running in the
 * kernel might lead to all kinds of locking problems.
 *
 * Accounting
 * ==========
 *
 * Accounting of CPU usage is based on per-thread micro-state accounting data.
 * On every clock tick clock() adds new on-CPU time for every thread found on
 * CPU. Scheduling classes also add new on-CPU time for any thread leaving CPU.
 * New times means time since it was last accounted for. On-CPU times greater
 * than 1 tick are truncated to 1 tick.
 *
 * Project CPU usage is aggregated from all threads within the project.
 * Zone CPU usage is the sum of usages for all projects within the zone. Zone
 * CPU usage is calculated on every clock tick by walking list of projects and
 * adding their usage together.
 *
 * Decay
 * =====
 *
 * CPU usage is decayed by the caps_update() routine which is called once per
 * every clock tick. It walks lists of project caps and decays their usages by
 * one per cent. If CPU usage drops below cap levels, threads on the wait queue
 * are made runnable again, one thread per clock tick.
 *
 * Interfaces
 * ==========
 *
 * The CPU Caps facility provides the following interfaces to the rest of the
 * system:
 *
 *   cpucaps_project_add(kproject_t *)
 *
 * Notifies the framework of a new project. It should be put on the
 * capped_projects list if its zone has a cap.
 *
 *   cpucaps_project_remove(kproject_t *)
 *
 * Remove the association between the specified project and its cap.
 * Called right before the project is destroyed.
 *
 * cpucaps_project_set(kproject_t *, rctl_qty_t)
 *
 * Set project cap of the specified project to the specified value. Setting the
 * value to NOCAP is equivalent to removing the cap.
 *
 *   cpucaps_zone_set(zone_t *, rctl_qty_t)
 *
 * Set zone cap of the specified zone to the specified value. Setting the value
 * to NOCAP is equivalent to removing the cap.
 *
 *   cpucaps_zone_remove(zone_t *)
 *
 * Remove the association between the zone and its cap.
 *
 *   cpucaps_charge(kthread_id_t, caps_sc_t *, cpucaps_charge_t)
 *
 * Charges specified thread's project the amount of on-CPU time that it used.
 * If the third argument is CPUCAPS_CHARGE_ONLY returns False.
 * Otherwise returns True if project or zone should be penalized because its
 * project or zone is exceeding its cap. Also sets TS_PROJWAITQ or TS_ZONEWAITQ
 * bits in t_schedflag in this case.
 *
 *   CPUCAPS_ENFORCE(kthread_id_t *)
 *
 * Enforces CPU caps for a specified thread. Places LWPs running in LWP_USER
 * state on project or zone wait queues, as requested by TS_PROJWAITQ or
 * TS_ZONEWAITQ bits in t_schedflag. Returns True if the thread was placed on a
 * wait queue or False otherwise.
 *
 *   cpucaps_sc_init(caps_sc_t *)
 *
 * Initializes the scheduling-class specific CPU Caps data for a thread.
 *
 * LOCKS
 * =====
 *
 * all the individual caps structures and their lists are protected by a global
 * caps_lock mutex. The lock is grabbed either by clock() or by events modifying
 * caps, so it is usually uncontended. We avoid all blocking memory allocations
 * while holding caps_lock to prevent clock() from blocking.
 *
 * Thread state is protected by the thread lock. It protects the association
 * between a thread and its project and, as a consequence, to its zone. The
 * association can not break while thread lock is held, so the project or zone
 * cap are not going to disappear while thread lock is held.
 */

/*
 * caps_lock protects list of capped projects and zones, changes in the cap
 * state and changes of the global cpucaps_enabled flag.
 *
 * Changing zone caps also sets cpucaps_busy to avoid races when a zone cap is
 * modified in parallel. This can be per-zone cap flag, but we don't keep any
 * cap state for now.
