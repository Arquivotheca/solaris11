/*
 * CMT scheduler / dispatcher support
 *
 * This file implements CMT scheduler support using Processor Groups.
 * The CMT processor group class creates and maintains the CMT class
 * specific processor group pg_cmt_t.
 *
 * ---------------------------- <-- pg_cmt_t *
 * | pghw_t                   |
 * ----------------------------
 * | CMT class specific data  |
 * | - hierarchy linkage      |
 * | - CMT load balancing data|
 * | - active CPU group/bitset|
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * The scheduler/dispatcher leverages knowledge of the performance
 * relevant CMT sharing relationships existing between cpus to implement
 * optimized affinity, load balancing, and coalescence policies.
 *
 * Load balancing policy seeks to improve performance by minimizing
 * contention over shared processor resources / facilities, Affinity
 * policies seek to improve cache and TLB utilization. Coalescence
 * policies improve resource utilization and ultimately power efficiency.
 *
 * The CMT PGs created by this class are already arranged into a
 * hierarchy (which is done in the pghw layer). To implement the top-down
 * CMT load balancing algorithm, the CMT PGs additionally maintain
 * parent, child and sibling hierarchy relationships.
 * Parent PGs always contain a superset of their children(s) resources,
 * each PG can have at most one parent, and siblings are the group of PGs
 * sharing the same parent.
 *
 * On UMA based systems, the CMT load balancing algorithm begins by balancing
 * load across the group of top level PGs in the system hierarchy.
 * On NUMA systems, the CMT load balancing algorithm balances load across the
 * group of top level PGs in each leaf lgroup...but for root homed threads,
 * is willing to balance against all the top level PGs in the system.
 *
 * Groups of top level PGs are maintained to implement the above, one for each
 * leaf lgroup (containing the top level PGs in that lgroup), and one (for the
 * root lgroup) that contains all the top level PGs in the system.

 * CMT lineage validation
 *
 * This routine is invoked by pg_cmt_cpu_init() to validate the integrity
 * of the PGs in a CPU's lineage. This is necessary because it's possible that
 * some groupings (power domain groupings in particular) may be defined by
 * sources that are buggy (e.g. BIOS bugs). In such cases, it may not be
 * possible to integrate those groupings into the CMT PG hierarchy, if doing
 * so would violate the subset invariant of the hierarchy, which says that
 * a PG must be subset of its parent (if it has one).
 *
 * pg_cmt_lineage_validate()'s purpose is to detect grouping definitions that
 * would result in a violation of this invariant. If a violation is found,
 * and the PG is of a grouping type who's definition is known to originate from
 * suspect sources (BIOS), then pg_cmt_prune() will be invoked to prune the
 * PG (and all other instances PG's sharing relationship type) from the CMT
 * hierarchy. Further, future instances of that sharing relationship type won't
 * be added. If the grouping definition doesn't originate from suspect
 * sources, then pg_cmt_disable() will be invoked to log an error, and disable
 * CMT scheduling altogether.
 *
 * This routine is invoked after the CPU has been added to the PGs in which
 * it belongs, but before those PGs have been added to (or had their place
 * adjusted in) the CMT PG hierarchy.
 *
 * The first argument is the CPUs PG lineage (essentially an array of PGs in
 * which the CPU belongs) that has already been sorted in ascending order
 * by CPU count. Some of the PGs in the CPUs lineage may already have other
 * CPUs in them, and have already been integrated into the CMT hierarchy.
 *
 * The addition of this new CPU to these pre-existing PGs means that those
 * PGs may need to be promoted up in the hierarchy to satisfy the subset
 * invariant. In additon to testing the subset invariant for the lineage,
 * this routine also verifies that the addition of the new CPU to the
 * existing PGs wouldn't cause the subset invariant to be violated in
 * the exiting lineages.
 *
 * This routine will normally return one of the following:
 * CMT_LINEAGE_VALID - There were no problems detected with the lineage.
 * CMT_LINEAGE_REPAIRED - Problems were detected, but repaired via pruning.
 *
 * Otherwise, this routine will return a value indicating which error it
 * was unable to recover from (and set cmt_lineage_status along the way).
 *
 * This routine operates on the CPU specific processor group data (for the CPU
 * whose lineage is being validated), which is under-construction.
 * "pgdata" is a reference to the CPU's under-construction PG data.
 * This routine must be careful to operate only on "pgdata", and not cp->cpu_pg.
