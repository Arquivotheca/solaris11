/*
 * on_trap() provides protection against various kinds of machine exceptions,
 * and must be used with extreme caution.  Like setjmp(), on_trap() returns
 * zero when explicitly called and non-zero when it returns as the result of
 * an exception.  The caller should not attempt to interpret the actual integer
 * return value except to test whether it is zero or non-zero.  on_trap() and
 * no_trap() are NOT DDI interfaces for public consumption.  For now, the
 * on_trap() mechanism is separate from on_fault() protection and the t_lofault
 * protection used by the various copy routines.
 *
 * Calls to on_trap() may be nested, but only the most recently installed bits
 * apply.  Protection bits may be OR-ed together if the caller wishes to
 * protect against more than one type of trap.  If on_trap() returns non-zero,
 * the bit corresponding to the trap that triggered return to on_trap() will
 * be stored in the ot_trap field of the caller's on_trap_data.
 *
 * After calling on_trap(), the caller may elect to modify ot_trampoline to
 * install a custom trampoline routine prior to executing the protected code
 * region.  No other fields of the on_trap_data should be modified by the
 * caller.  The trampoline may not be applicable on all platforms.
 *
 * The on_trap_data structures are kept in a stack (linked list) whose top
 * is pointed to by the current thread's t_ontrap field.  A no_trap() call
 * pops the top element from the stack and resets t_ontrap to ot_prev.
 * We assume the caller has allocated the on_trap_data on the stack or
 * made other arrangements, so we do not need to worry about deallocation.
 *
 * If repeated calls to on_trap() are made using the same on_trap_data address,
 * the topmost stack element is modified in-place (the same on_trap_data is
 * not pushed twice), allowing callers to use on_trap() in a loop.  The act
 * of catching an exception does NOT modify t_ontrap.  Even if on_trap()
 * returns non-zero, the caller must use no_trap() to clear trap protection.
 *
 * Calls to no_trap() are permitted when the on_trap_data stack is empty; they
 * have no effect.  no_trap() only modifies t_ontrap; it does not modify the
 * internals of the topmost on_trap_data element.  It is therefore legal for
 * callers to examine the contents of the on_trap_data (specifically ot_trap)
 * after the data is popped using no_trap().
 *
 * A given platform may not implement all the forms of on_trap() protection.
 * The on_trap_data will be pushed on the t_ontrap stack with ot_prot set
 * regardless.  We must guarantee that if the platform does not implement
 * a trap protection, the exceptional condition will trigger a panic.  We do
 * not permit a platform to allow the exceptional condition to occur silently
 * and then continue to execute the caller's protected code region.
