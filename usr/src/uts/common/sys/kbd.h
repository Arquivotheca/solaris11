 * This defines the format of translation tables.

 * a case statement in getkey.c.  If the entry is less than 0x100, it
 * is sent out as an EUC character (possibly with bucky bits
 * OR-ed in).  "Special" entries are 0x100 or greater, and
 * invoke more complicated actions.
 *
 * The KEYMAP_SIZE is dependent upon the keyboard type.  For example, the
 * Sun Type 4/5 keyboards have a KEYMAP_SIZE of 128 where a USB keyboard
 * has a KEYMAP_SIZE of 255.  Instead of defining a KEYMAP_SIZE per
 * keyboard type, a keyboard specific module/driver may supply the value
 * at run time by defining the KEYMAP_SIZE_VARIABLE and filling in the
 * keyboard struct appropriately.
