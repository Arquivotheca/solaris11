/*
 *	Each buffer in the pool is usually doubly linked into 2 lists:
 *	the device with which it is currently associated (always)
 *	and also on a list of blocks available for allocation
 *	for other use (usually).
 *	The latter list is kept in last-used order, and the two
 *	lists are doubly linked to make it easy to remove
 *	a buffer from one list when it was found by
 *	looking through the other.
 *	A buffer is on the available list, and is liable
 *	to be reassigned to another disk block, if and only
 *	if it is not marked BUSY.  When a buffer is busy, the
 *	available-list pointers can be used for other purposes.
 *	Most drivers use the forward ptr as a link in their I/O active queue.
 *	A buffer header contains all the information required to perform I/O.
 *	Most of the routines which manipulate these things are in bio.c.
 *
 *	There are a number of locks associated with the buffer management
 *	system.
 *	hbuf.b_lock:	protects hash chains, buffer hdr freelists
 *			and delayed write freelist
 *	bfree_lock;	protects the bfreelist structure
 *	bhdr_lock:	protects the free header list
 *	blist_lock:	protects b_list fields
 *	buf.b_sem:	protects all remaining members in the buf struct
 *	buf.b_io:	I/O synchronization variable
 *
 *	A buffer header is never "locked" (b_sem) when it is on
 *	a "freelist" (bhdrlist or bfreelist avail lists).

 * between the sole use of these two flags.  In both cases, IO will be done
 * if the page is not yet committed to storage.
 *
 * In order to discard pages without writing them back, (B_INVAL | B_TRUNC)
