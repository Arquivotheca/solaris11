/*
 * Copy in/out vector operations.  This structure is used to interpose
 * on the kernel copyin/copyout/etc. operations for various purposes
 * such as handling watchpoints in the affected user memory.  When one of the
 * copy operations causes a fault, the corresponding function in this vector is
 * called to handle it.
 *
 * The 64-bit operations in the structure fetch and store extended
 * words and are only used on platforms with 64 bit general
 * registers e.g. sun4u.
 *
 * Since the only users of these interfaces (watchpoints and pxfs) perform the
 * default action unless there is a page fault, we can save the overhead of
 * having to go through this indirection unless there is a page fault.  This
 * improves performance both in general and when watchpoints are enabled.  If,
 * in the future, a consumer relies on being able to interpose on all actions,
 * then this assumption will have to be undone.
 *
 * No consumers should call these functions directly.  They are automatically
 * handled by the generic versions.
