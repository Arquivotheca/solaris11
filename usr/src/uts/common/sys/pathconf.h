/*
 * POSIX pathconf information
 *
 * static pathconf kludge notes:
 *	For NFSv2 servers, we've added a vop (vop_cntl) to dig out pathconf
 *	information.  The mount program asked for the information from
 *	a remote mountd daemon.  If it gets it, it passes the info
 *	down in a new args field.  The info is passed in the struct below
 *	in nfsargs.pathconf.  There's a new NFS mount flag so that you know
 *	this is happening.  NFS stores the information locally; when a
 *	pathconf request is made, the request is intercepted at the client
 *	and the information is retrieved from the struct passed down by
 *	mount. It's a kludge that will go away as soon
 *	as we can ask the nfs protocol these sorts of questions (NFSr3).
 *	All code is noted by "static pathconf kludge" comments and is
 *	restricted to nfs code in the kernel.
