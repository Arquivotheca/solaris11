/*
 * Lower Queue State:
 *
 * Every physical keyboard has a corresponding STREAMS queue. We call this
 * queue lower queue. To describe this kind of queue, we define a structure
 * (refer conskbd_lower_queue_t). Every lower queue has a state, transform
 * of the state describes the process from a keyborad attached to system to
 * the keyboard is plumbed into conskbd or rejected.
 *  Rule:
 *
 * 1) LQS_UNINITIALIZED 	--->	LQS_KIOCTYPE_ACK_PENDING;
 * 	send a KIOCTYPE to lower queue, and then wait response;
 *
 * 2) LQS_KIOCTYPE_ACK_PENDING	--->	LQS_INITIALIZED_LEGACY;
 * 	receive nak to KIOCTYPE, the corresponding keyboard can not
 * 	multiplexed with other keyboards. so the conskbd is bypassed,
 * 	only one keyboard is supported.
 *
 * 3) LQS_KIOCTYPE_ACK_PENDING	--->	LQS_KIOCTRANS_ACK_PENDING;
 *	receive ack to KIOCTYPE, and send KIOCTRANS to lower queue,
 *
 * 4) LQS_KIOCTRANS_ACK_PENDING	--->	LQS_KIOCLAYOUT_ACK_PENDING;
 * 	receive ack to KIOCTRANS, and send KIOCLAYOUT to lower queue
 *
 * 5) LQS_KIOCTRANS_ACK_PENDING --->	Destroy
 * 	receive nak to KIOCTRANS, it is a fatal error so that this
 * 	keyboard is not avilable. destroy the lower queue struct.
 *
 * 6) LQS_KIOCLAYOUT_ACK_PENDING --->	LQS_KIOCSLED_ACK_PENDING;
 * 	receive ack/nak to KIOCLAYOUT, and send KIOCSLED/KIOCGLED to
 *	lower queue.
 *
 * 7) LQS_KIOCSLED_ACK_PENDING	--->	LQS_INITIALIZED
 * 	receive ack/nak, the keyboard is linked under conskbd, multiplexed
 * 	with other keyboards.
 *
 * 8) when lower queue is in the state of LQS_INITIALIZED_LEGACY or
 *    LQS_INITIALIZED, no state transform occures unless the lower
 *    queue is destroyed.
