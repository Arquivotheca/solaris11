/*
 * Implementation notes in the fdbuffer structure members:
 *
 * fd_state: The state variable carries four distinct types of information
 *           it could probably be a bit field as such.
 *
 *	READ/WRITE:
 *		This information is stored in fdbuffer at the time the
 *		The buffer is created and is used for sanity check in
 *		subsequent calls to fdb_iosetup(). This information
 *		persists for the entire life of the buffer.
 *
 *	[A]SYNC:
 *		The buffer can be either in sync or async mode. In
 *		async mode all calls are to be async and the i/o
 *		must take place for the entire range or the fdbuf
 *		i/o must be ended with a call to fdb_ioerrdone()
 *		In the async case the call back is made either
 *		for every i/o completed or only once at the end
 *		of i/o. This depends on how the call back function
 *		is registered. See fdb_set_iofunc(). The fdbuf has
 *		to be freed by the call back function.
 *
 *	ZEROHOLE:
 *		This is the case the holes are to be zeroed. Note
 *		that we do not zero the holes when fdb_add_hole() is
 *		getting called. We leave the zeroing of the holes to
 *		when a list is requested or the buffer is freed. This
 *		so that we can avoid zeroing pages while holding ufs
 *		locks.
