 * should be subtracted from the utilization level at 'pri' and attributed to
 * priorities below it (also in %). Non transient, CPU intensive threads at
 * or above priority 'pri' will be assigned 'pct' of a specific PG. The same
 * class of threads but at priorities below 'pri' will be assigned utilization
 * levels according to 'decay'.
 *
 * For example, on an eight CPU PG with the following mapping: pct = 100,

 * level of eight, priority 59 will be assigned a utilization level of four and
