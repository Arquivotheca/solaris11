 * DMA addressing limits.
 *
 * This structure describes the constraints that a particular device's
 * DMA engine has to its parent so that the parent may correctly set
 * things up for a DMA mapping. Each parent may in turn modify the
 * constraints listed in a DMA request structure in order to describe
 * to its parent any changed or additional constraints. The rules
 * are that each parent may modify a constraint in order to further
 * constrain things (e.g., picking a more limited address range than
 * that permitted by the child), but that the parent may not ignore
 * a child's constraints.
 *
 * A particular constraint that we do *not* address is whether or not
 * a requested mapping is too large for a DMA engine's counter to
 * correctly track. It is still up to each driver to explicitly handle
 * transfers that are too large for its own hardware to deal with directly.
 *
 * The mapping routines that are cognizant of this structure will
 * copy any user defined limits structure if they need to modify
 * the fields (as alluded to above).
 *
 * A note as to how to define constraints:
 *
 * How you define the constraints for your device depends on how you
 * define your device. For example, you may have an SBus card with a
 * device on it that address only the bottom 16mb of virtual DMA space.
 * However, if the card also has ancillary circuitry that pulls the high 8
 * bits of address lines high, the more correct expression for your device
 * is that it address [0xff000000..0xffffffff] rather than [0..0x00ffffff].

 * Cache attribute flags:
 *
 * IOMEM_DATA_CACHED
 *   The CPU can cache the data it fetches and push it to memory at a later
 *   time. This is the default attribute and used if no cache attributes is
 *   specified.
 *
 * IOMEM_DATA_UC_WR_COMBINE
 *   The CPU never caches the data but writes may occur out of order or be
 *   combined. It implies re-ordering.
 *
 * IOMEM_DATA_UNCACHED
 *   The CPU never caches the data and has uncacheable access to memory.
 *   It also implies strict ordering.
 *
 * The cache attributes are mutually exclusive, and any combination of the
 * values leads to a failure. On the sparc architecture, only IOMEM_DATA_CACHED
 * is meaningful, but others lead to a failure.
