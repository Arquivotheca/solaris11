 * Specifics of arguments to ddi_dmae_alloc:
 *
 * dip - dev_info pointer, which identifies the base device that wishes
 * to use the DMA channel.
 *
 * chnl - a DMA channel number.
 *
 * dmae_waitfp - wait/callback_function pointer, which operates in the same
 * manner as in ddi_dma_setup().  The value DDI_DMA_DONTWAIT will cause an
 * immediate return if the channel cannot be acquired.  The value
 * DDI_DMA_SLEEP will will cause the thread to sleep and not return until
 * the channel has been acquired.  Any other value is assumed to be a
 * callback function address.
 *
 * When resources might be available, the callback function is called
 * (with the argument specified in arg) from interrupt context.
 *
 * When the callback function dmae_waitfp() is called, it should attempt to
 * allocate the DMA channel again. If it succeeds or does not need the
 * channel any more, it must return the value DDI_DMA_CALLBACK_DONE.
 * If it does not want to allocate the channel, but instead wishes to be
 * called back again later, it must return the value DDI_DMA_CALLBACK_LATER.
 * If it tries to allocate the channel, but fails to do so, it must return the
 * value DDI_DMA_CALLBACK_RUNOUT.
 *
 * Failure to observe this protocol will have unpredictable results.
 *
 * The callback function must provide its own data structure integrity
 * when it is invoked.

 *

 * is implementation specific and contains all the info necessary to
 * setup the channel, except for the memory address and count.
 * This structure is implemented with default values equal to zero,
 * so that normally only der_command has to be set with a read or write
 * command value.  Once the channel has been setup, subsequent calls to
 * ddi_dmae_prog() can have dmaereqp set to NULL if only the address and
 * count have to be updated.

 * ddi_dma_segtocookie(),  which contains address, count and intermediate
 * memory mapping information.
