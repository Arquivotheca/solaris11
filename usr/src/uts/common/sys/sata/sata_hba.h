/*
 * SATA cmd structure  (rev 1)
 *
 * SATA HBA framework always sets all fields except status_reg and error_reg.
 * SATA HBA driver action depends on the addressing type specified by
 * addr_type field:
 * If LBA48 addressing is indicated, SATA HBA driver has to load values from
 * satacmd_sec_count_msb_reg, satacmd_lba_low_msb_reg,
 * satacmd_lba_mid_msb_reg and satacmd_lba_hi_msb_reg
 * to appropriate registers prior to loading other registers.
 * For other addressing modes, SATA HBA driver should skip loading values
 * from satacmd_sec_count_msb_reg, satacmd_lba_low_msb_reg,
 * satacmd_lba_mid_msb_reg and satacmd_lba_hi_msb_reg
 * fields and load only remaining field values to corresponding registers.
 *
 * satacmd_sec_count_msb and satamcd_sec_count_lsb values are loaded into
 * sec_count register, satacmd_sec_count_msb loaded first (if LBA48
 * addressing is used).
 * satacmd_lba_low_msb and satacmd_lba_low_lsb values are loaded into the
 * lba_low register, satacmd_lba_low_msb loaded first (if LBA48 addressing
 * is used). The lba_low register is the newer name for the old
 * sector_number register.
 * satacmd_lba_mid_msb and satacmd_lba_mid_lsb values are loaded into lba_mid
 * register, satacmd_lba_mid_msb loaded first (if LBA48 addressing is used).
 * The lba_mid register is the newer name for the old cylinder_low register.
 * satacmd_lba_high_msb and satacmd_lba_high_lsb values are loaded into
 * the lba_high regster, satacmd_lba_high_msb loaded first (if LBA48
 * addressing is used). The lba_high register  is a newer name for the old
 * cylinder_high register.
 *
 * No addressing mode is selected when an ata command does not involve actual
 * reading/writing data from/to the media (for example IDENTIFY DEVICE or
 * SET FEATURE command), or the ATAPI PACKET command is sent.
 * If ATAPI PACKET command is sent and tagged commands are used,
 * SATA HBA driver has to provide and manage a tag value and
 * set it into the sector_count register.
 *
 * Device Control register is not specified in sata_cmd structure - SATA HBA
 * driver shall set it accordingly to current mode of operation (interrupt
 * enable/disable).
 *
 * Buffer structure's b_flags should be used to determine the
 * address type of b_un.b_addr. However, there is no need to allocate DMA
 * resources for the buffer in SATA HBA driver.
 * DMA resources for a buffer structure are allocated by the SATA HBA
 * framework. Scatter/gather list is to be used only for DMA transfers
 * and it should be based on the DMA cookies list.
 *
 * Upon completion of a command, SATA HBA driver has to update
 * satacmd_status_reg and satacmd_error_reg to reflect the contents of
 * the corresponding device status and error registers.
 * If the command completed successfully, satacmd_flags.sata_copy_xxx flags
 * specify what register fields should be updated in sata_cmd structure.
 * If the command completed with error, SATA HBA driver has to update
 * satacmd_sec_count_msb, satacmd_sec_count_lsb, satacmd_lba_low_msb,
 * satacmd_lba_low_lsb, satacmd_lba_mid_msb, satacmd_lba_mid_lsb,
 * satacmd_lba_high_msb and satacmd_lba_high_lsb to values read from the
 * corresponding device registers.
 * If an operation could not complete because of the port error, the
 * sata_pkt.satapkt_device.satadev_scr structure has to be updated.
 *
 * If ATAPI PACKET command was sent and command completed with error,
 * rqsense structure has to be filed by SATA HBA driver. The satacmd_arq_cdb
 * points to pre-set request sense cdb that may be used for issuing request
 * sense data from the device.
 *
 * The sata_max_queue_depth field specifies the maximum allowable queue depth
 * minus one, i.e. for maximum queue depth of 32, sata_max_queue_depth would
 * be set to value 0x1f.
 * If FPDMA-type command was sent and command completed with error, the HBA
 * driver may use pre-set command READ LOG EXTENDED command pointed to
 * by satacmd_rle_sata_cmd field to retrieve error data from a device.
 * Only ATA register fields of the sata_cmd are set-up for that purpose.
 *
 * If the READ MULTIPLIER command was specified in cmd_reg (command directed
 * to a port multiplier host port rather then to an attached device),
 * upon the command completion SATA HBA driver has to update_sector count
 * and lba fields of the sata_cmd structure to values returned via
 * command block registers (task file registers).
