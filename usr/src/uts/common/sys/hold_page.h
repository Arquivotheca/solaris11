/*
 * swrand generates entropy by mapping different pages in the system.  This
 * can create problems for some hypervisors, as certain pages may be removed
 * from the system at any time.  The following interfaces allow swrand to
 * check the validity and make sure a page is not given away while it is mapped.
 *
 * int plat_hold_page(pfn_t pfn, int lock, page_t **pp_ret)
 *
 *	If lock is PLAT_HOLD_NO_LOCK, simply check if the page pfn is valid
 *	in the system.  If the page is valid, PLAT_HOLD_OK will be returned.
 *	pp_ret is ignored if lock is PLAT_HOLD_NO_LOCK.
 *
 *	If lock is PLAT_HOLD_LOCK, in addition to the above, attempt to lock
 *	the page exclusively.  Again, if the lock is successful, the page
 *	pointer will be put in pp_ret, and PLAT_HOLD_OK will be returned.
 *	pp_ret must be passed to a later call to plat_release_page.  If the
 *	page wasn't found, or the lock couldn't be grabbed, the return value
 *	will be PLAT_HOLD_FAIL.
 *
 * void plat_release_page(page_t *pp)
 *
 *	Unlock the page pp.  Should only be called after a previous,
 *	successful call to plat_hold_page(pfn, PLAT_HOLD_LOCK, &pp);
