 * ibmf_retrans_t data type is used to specify the maximum values
 * of the retransmission parameters, number of retries,
 * response time value, round trip travel time, and transaction timeout.
 *
 * The retries value must be provided by the client
 * for all the transaction types enumerated by ibmf_trans_t.
 * The retries value will be used to retry any section of
 * the underlying transmission and reception protocol that
 * are time bound by timers.
 *
 * The response time value must be specified for all transaction types except an
 * unsequenced, non-RMPP send (see the table below).
 * The response time value is the length of processing time for the
 * responder to process the requested transaction, from the point of receiving
 * the last request packet, to the point of returning the first response packet.
 * This value is interpreted in microseconds.
 * If the response time value is zero, an implementation default is used.
 *
 * The round trip time must be specified for all transaction types except an
 * unsequenced, non-RMPP send (see the table below).
 * The round trip travel time is the maximum time it should take a packet
 * to travel from the requester to the responder and back to the requester.
 * This value does not include the processing time at the responder.
 * This value is interpreted in microseconds.
 * If the round trip time value is zero, an implementation default is used.
 *
 * The transaction timeout should be specified for all transactions
 * using RMPP to receive a message.
 * Since, it is not possible for the client to know the size of the
 * response, IBMF will calculate a reasonable transaction timeout after
 * receiving the first RMPP data packet of the response at which time the
 * size of the message will be known.  If this value is greater than the
 * client's transaction timeout parameter the client's value will be used.
 * If the client's transaction timeout parameter is 0 the calculated value will
 * be used.
 * This value is interpreted in microseconds.
 * If the transaction timeout value is zero, an implementation default is used.
 *
 * See Section 13.6.3.1, of the InfiniBand Architecture Specification,
 * Volume 1, Release 1.1 for details on how to deduce this value.
 *
 * The following table describes the retrans parameters needed for
 * the various ibmf_msg_transport() flag combinations.

/*
 * ibmf_register():
 *
 * An agent needs to register before it can receive any management packets
 * and a manager needs to register before it can send/receive any management
 * packets. The registration is on a per port of the node basis.
 *
 * A client can register for one class per call to ibmf_register().
 * The client should set ir_client_class component of the client_info argument
 * to the class it wants to register for.
 * ibmf_register() will fail if the class is already registered for,
 * with the error code IBMF_PORT_IN_USE.
 *
 * Note that for some classes, the client can register as agent or manager only
 * and agent+manager only. An exception to this rule is the UNIVERSAL_CLASS
 * described below.
 *
 * Clients that require to send/receive general UD traffic,
 * not limited to MADs, over a UD QP may do so by registering
 * with the UNIVERSAL_CLASS client type.
 * Unlike the other IBMF client types, any number of clients may
 * be simultaneously registered for the UNIVERSAL_CLASS on a port.
 * When registered with the UNIVERSAL_CLASS, a client should only use the
 * alternate QPs, and never use the default QP handle.
 * However, a client registered for any other client type may also use
 * the alternate QPs in addition to using the default QP handle.
 * IBMF implementations that do not support registration for the UNIVERSAL class
 * will return IBMF_NOT_SUPPORTED.
 *
 * NOTE on usage of qp handles:
 *
 * Some implementations support specifying any Q_Key and P_Key
 * combination when ibmf_qp_handle_t arg is set to IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT
 * in the call to ibmf_msg_transport() and some implementations allow only
 * the default values of Q_Key (0x8001_0000) and P_Key (0xFFFF/0x7FFFF)
 * when ibmf_qp_handle_t arg is IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT. The client can know
 * the behavior supported via ibmf_impl_caps_t arg on successful return from
 * ibmf_register(). ibmf_impl_caps_t arg points to a bit mask of the
 * capabilities of the platform. If the implementation supports any
 * P_Key and/or Q_Key value with IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT, then
 * IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_P_KEY_ANY and/or IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_Q_KEY_ANY will be set in
 * ibmf_impl_caps_t.
 *
 * Some implementations support specifying any P_Key and Q_Key combination on
 * a per-request basis when ibmf_qp_handle_t is set to an explicitly allocated
 * qp handle (the client specifies the P_Key/Q_Key value in ibmf_addr_info_t
 * argument). IBMA indicates this behavior by setting
 * IBMF_NON_DEF_QP_HDL_P_KEY_ANY and/or IBMF_NON_DEF_QP_HDL_Q_KEY_ANY in the
 * ibmf_impl_caps_t arg. In such an implementation, ibmf_modify_qp() does not
 * change anything in the transport and always returns IBMF_SUCCESS.
 *
 * When the implementation supports IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_P_KEY_ANY and/or
 * IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_Q_KEY_ANY, it may map IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT to any qp
 * number(s) supported by the
 * underlying transport. The client can not not make any assumptions on this
 * mapping nor can it query ibmf for the qp num being used with
 * IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT. There are cases where the client needs to have
 * explicit control over the qp number being used by ibmf (eg., agent
 * redirection). The client should explicitly allocate a qp using
 * ibmf_alloc_qp() in such cases.
 *
 * Also, IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT can only be used when the class of the MAD
 * being sent using ibmf_msg_transport() is the same as the class the client
 * registered for. If a client wishes to send a MAD class other than the
 * one it registered for, it should explicitly allocate a qp and use that
 * qp while sending MADs.
 *
 * If the implementation supports
 * IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_P_KEY_ANY/IBMF_DEF_QP_HDL_Q_KEY_ANY and/or
 * IBMF_NON_DEF_QP_HDL_P_KEY_ANY/IBMF_NON_DEF_QP_HDL_Q_KEY_ANY, it is the
 * implementation's responsibility to ensure that the
 * requested P_Key and Q_Key can be used by, with in resource limitations,
 * concurrent sends.
 *
 * Clients registering for classes that include an RMPP header in their
 * MADs must set the IBMF_REG_FLAG_RMPP flag when registering with IBMF.
 * This must be done regardless of whether the client intends to use
 * the RMPP protocol or not. The flag is an indicator to IBMF of the
 * presence of the RMPP header in the MAD.
 *
 * IBMF will always insure that receive buffer pointers are offsets into a
 * single contiguous buffer of memory. The im_msgbufs_recv.im_bufs_mad_hdr,
 * points to the start of the buffer. The other two pointers,
 * im_msgbufs_recv.im_bufs_cl_hdr, and im_msgbufs_recv.im_bufs_cl_data,
 * will point to class specific offsets within the buffer.
 *
 * Clients may provide a pointer to a callback function in the client_cb
 * argument. Implementations of ibmf that require the client_cb to
 * be specified should return IBMF_INVALID_ARG if the client_cb argument
 * is NULL.
 *
 * This interface may block

/*
 * ibmf_msg_transport():
 *
 * This interface does not block if a callback is specified.
 *
 * IBMF makes some preliminary checks and returns failure if the
 * checks fail. The callback, if any, is not called in this case. If the
 * checks pass, the message specified in msgp->im_msgbufs_send is relayed
 * down into the transport layer over as many MAD packets as necessary
 * to accommodate the entire message. The IBMF_MSG_TRANS_FLAG_RMPP flag is set
 * when the RMPP protocol should be used when sending out the message.
 * The IBMF_MSG_TRANS_FLAG_SEQ is set when the the transaction is a
 * sequenced transaction (send and receive) where the client expects a reply.
 * The transaction completion callback will be invoked when IBMF
 * is done processing the send operation and after having received the
 * complete response if one is due, with or without errors.
 * If no callback is specified, the routine blocks till the underlying
 * transport is done processing the send request and received the complete
 * response, with or without errors
 *
 * When sending non-MAD traffic over the alternate QPs,
 * if the message data exceeds the maximum MTU supported, the call will fail
 * with the status IBMF_BAD_SIZE.
 *
 * NOTE: If the call is asynchronous, the callback may be invoked before
 * the call returns. The client should be prepared to handle this possibility.
 *
 * The message is sent to the address specified by msgp->im_local_addr and
 * msgp->im_global_addr (global address invalid for SMPs and is ignored).
 * Note that the desired Q_Key and P_Key can be specified via
 * msgp->im_local_addr. If the ibmf implementation does not support any
 * value of Q_Key/P_Key with IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT, it is an error to specify
 * a Q_Key other than 0x8001_0000 and a P_Key other than 0xFFFF/0x7FFF when
 * ibmf_qp_handle_t arg is set IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT. (See the NOTE in
 * ibmf_register() on what the platform supports.) In this case, when a q_key
 * value other than 0x8001_0000 and/or P_Key value other than
 * 0xFFFF/0x7FFF is desired, the client should allocate its own qp handle
 * with the desired values and use that in the ibmf_msg_transport() call.
 * ibmf_msg_transport() returns IBMF_BAD_HANDLE to flag the error.
 *
 * NOTE: If the qp handle is not the default handle (ie., not
 * IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT), it is possible for some other thread to modify
 * P_Key and Q_Key value associated with the qp_handle while this function
 * is executing; this routine may return IBMF_BAD_HANDLE if that
 * happens. It is possible that the modification happens after this routine
 * validates the values, in which case no error may be flagged.
 *
 * NOTE: if the class of the MAD being sent is not the same as what the
 * ibmf_handle (obtained via ibmf_register()) corresponds to, ibmf_qp_handle
 * can not be set to IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT.
 *
 * NOTE on notation: A message structure allocated by an ibmf_alloc_msg()
 * call or one returned in an unsolicted callback will be referred to as
 * "Message". When referring to a message in the general sense of the word,
 * it will be referred to as "message".
 * NOTE: Rules for reusing an IBMF Message:
 * Clients may reuse a Message, either provided by IBMF in an unsolicited
 * request, or one obtained through the ibmf_alloc_msg() call, for a
 * subsequent request from the client itself. The client may reuse a Message
 * to avoid the overhead of allocating a new Message and new send buffers.
 * To safely reuse Messages, the client must follow the rules listed below.
 * 1) Using the receive buffers to send the message header and data:
 * If the Message has been provided by IBMF in an unsolicited request,
 * it will have its receive buffers already allocated and pointed to by
 * im_msgbufs_recv pointers by IBMF. In such a case, a client may set
 * the im_msgbufs_send pointers to the values in the im_msgbufs_recv
 * thus reusing the buffer allocated by IBMF for the incoming Message.
 * However, this may be done only when the request from the client is
 * a non-sequenced operation i.e. IBMF_MSG_TRANS_FLAG_SEQ flag is not set.
 * An attempt to reuse the receive buffer for any other operation will
 * result in the failure of the ibmf_msg_transport() call with the error
 * status IBMF_REQ_INVALID.
 * 2) Providing send buffers to send the message header and data:
 * If the client provides its own send buffers for the message header and data,
 * the IBMF Message may be reused for both sequenced and non-sequenced
 * transactions. Any receive buffers that were allocated by IBMF from a
 * previous transaction, will be freed up once the Message is reused in an
 * ibmf_msg_transport() call. New receive buffers will be provided by IBMF
 * if the new transaction is a sequenced transaction.
 *
 * Input arguments:
 *	Handle to the IBMF interface
 *	IBMF QP handle (either allocated via ibmf_alloc_qp() or
 *	    IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT [see the NOTE above regarding MAD class])
 *	Pointer to ibmf_msg_t to be sent
 *	A pointer to ibmf_retrans_t to specify retries and timeout
 *	values to use during the transaction.
 *	Function to be called when the operation is done.
 *		(the routine is blocking if this function is NULL).
 *	Argument to be passed when the callback is invoked
 *	flags - set IBMF_MSG_TRANS_FLAG_RMPP if send should use RMPP
 *		set IBMF_MSG_TRANS_FLAG_SEQ if transaction is sequenced
 *
 * Output arguments:
 *	None
 *
 * Return values:
 *	IBMF_SUCCESS		- If blocking call, the operation was
 *				  completed by the transport. For
 *				  non blocking call, the request passed basic
 *				  checks and the callback should be expected.
 *	IBMF_BAD_HANDLE		- operation failure - invalid ibmf handle
 *	IBMF_BAD_QP_HANDLE	- operation failure - invalid qp handle or
 *				  q_key/p_key in msgp->ip_local_addr is
 *				  inconsistent with ibmf_qp_handle (for eg.,
 *				  handle is IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT and

 *				  doesn't support non-default keys on this
 *				  qp_handle or handle is IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT

 *	IBMF_BAD_PORT_STATE	- operation failure - port in incorrect state

 *	IBMF_FAILURE		- operation failure - unspecified error
 *	IBMF_BAD_SIZE		- data size in message to long for single UD pkt
 *	IBMF_BAD_RMPP_OPT	- the class or QP does not support RMPP
 *	IBMF_PARTIAL_TRANSFER	- only part of the received data was returned

 *	IBMF_TRANS_TIMEOUT	- transaction timed out
 *	IBMF_TRANS_FAILURE	- transaction failure
