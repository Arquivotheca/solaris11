 * ibmf_msg_bufs_t
 *	From the client's perspective, the message will consist of three
 *	sections, the MAD header, the Management Class header, and the
 *	data payload. IBMF will either assemble these sections into
 *	a message or disassemble the incoming message into these sections.
 *
 *	The MAD header buffer is always 24 bytes in length.
 *	It may be set to NULL only when the QP is configured for raw
 *	UD traffic through the flags specified in ibmf_alloc_qp().
 *
 *	The class header buffer pointer may point to a buffer containing
 *	the class specific header as defined by the IB Architecture
 *	Specification, rev1.1. Note that the RMPP header should not be
 *	included in the class header for classes that support RMPP.
 *	For example, for the Subnet Administration (SA) class, the class
 *	header starts at byte offset 36 in the MAD and is of length 20 bytes.
 *
 *	The data is provided in a buffer pointed to by im_bufs_cl_data,
 *	with the data length provided in im_bufs_cl_data_len.
 *
 *	When sending a MAD message, the client may choose to not provide
 *	a class header buffer in im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_cl_hdr.
 *	In this case, the im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_cl_hdr must be NULL,
 *	and IBMF will interpret this to imply that the class header
 *	and data buffer are grouped together in the
 *	im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_cl_data buffer.
 *
 *	When sending a RAW UD packet over a non-special QP (i.e. not
 *	IBMF_QP_HANDLE_DEFAULT), the entire packet must be provided
 *	in a buffer pointed to by im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_cl_data.
 *	The im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_mad_hdr and
 *	im_msgbufs_send.im_bufs_cl_hdr pointers should be NULL.
 *
 *	The data contained in these buffers, MAD header, Management Class
 *	header, and data payload buffers, must be in wire format which
 *	is the big-endian format.
