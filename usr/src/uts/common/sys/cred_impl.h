/*
 * The user credential implementation.
 *
 * This is is not a public interface.  This file must not be included
 * except by those routines in Solaris proper that implement credential
 * manipulation and kernel policy.
 *
 * Credentials are shared, and therefor read-only, data structure.
 * After finalization, on the cr_ref field is changed through crhold/crfree.
 *
 * Kernel modules that need access to fields of cred_t should use the
 * accessor functions defined in <sys/cred.h>
 *
 * The size of the cr_groups[] array is configurable but is the same
 * (ngroups_max) for all cred_impl structures; cr_ngroups records the number
 * of elements currently in use, not the array size.
 *
 * Changes in the implementation will move cr_groups[] around.
 *
 * Properly sized cred_t structures are only returned by crget()/crdup()
 * crcopy().  It is not possible to declare one.
