 * resumes processing after telmod receives a protocol sequence which it does

 * input and output are the only modes supported.

 * TEL_IOC_GETBLK: When telmod is not enabled, this ioctl requests that
 * the next input message from the network to be processed is forwarded
 * through the mux to the daemon.
