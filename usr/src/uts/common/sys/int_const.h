/*
 * This file, <sys/int_const.h>, is part of the Sun Microsystems implementation

 * draft for the revision of the current ISO C standard, ISO/IEC 9899:1990
 * Programming language - C.
 *
 * Programs/Modules should not directly include this file.  Access to the
 * types defined in this file should be through the inclusion of one of the
 * following files:
 *
 *	<sys/inttypes.h>	Provides the Kernel and Driver appropriate
 *				components of <inttypes.h>.
 *
 *	<inttypes.h>		For use by applications.
 *
 * See these files for more details.
 *
 * Use at your own risk.  This file will track the evolution of the revision
 * of the current ISO C standard.  As of February 1996, the committee is

 * Constants
 *
 * The following macros create constants of the types defined in
 * <sys/int_types.h>. The intent is that:
 *	Constants defined using these macros have a specific size and
 *	signedness. The suffix used for int64_t and uint64_t (ll and ull)
 *	are for examples only. Implementations are permitted to use other
 *	suffixes.
 *
 * The "CSTYLED" comments are flags to an internal code style analysis tool
 * telling it to silently accept the line which follows.  This internal
 * standard requires a space between arguments, but the historical,
 * non-ANSI-C ``method'' of concatenation can't tolerate those spaces.
