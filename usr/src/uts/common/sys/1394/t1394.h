/*
 * ISOCHRONOUS SERVICES:

 *    services. The t1394_alloc_isoch_single() routine takes a target

 *    attempt to setup an isochronous channel (which will be automatically
 *    reallocated after bus resets), and it will return the channel number
 *    of the allocated channel in the t1394_isoch_single_out_t structure.
 *    Additionally, it returns a t1394_isoch_single_handle_t structure
 *    which is passed to t1394_free_isoch_single() when the isochronous
 *    channel is no longer required.
 *    The t1394_alloc_isoch_cec() and t1394_free_isoch_cec() are used to
 *    allocate and free an Isoch Channel Event Coordinator (CEC).  Target
 *    drivers pass a t1394_isoch_cec_props_t structure (described above)
 *    to specify the initial characteristics of the Isoch CEC.
 *    Targets will subsequently join the Isoch CEC with t1394_join_isoch_cec()
 *    before setting up the channel with t1394_setup_isoch_cec().
 *    Calls to t1394_join_isoch_cec() are used by targets who wish to join
 *    the Isoch CEC and receive all of the channel event notifications.
 *    When they want to leave target drivers call t1394_leave_isoch_cec().
 *    The t1394_setup_isoch_cec(), as described above, is used to setup the
 *    the isochronous channel and bandwidth and to notify all member targets
 *    of the allocated channel number and speed.  After targets have finished
 *    using the isoch channel, the resources can be torn down with a call to
 *    t1394_teardown_isoch_cec().
 *    Additionally, the t1394_start_isoch_cec() and t1394_stop_isoch_cec()
 *    routines can be used by member targets to coordinate additional events,
 *    such as the starting and stopping of isochronous DMA or other resources.

/*
 * ISOCHRONOUS DMA (LOCAL ISOCH DMA) SERVICES:
 *    These are the calls into the 1394 Framework used for local

 *    takes a target handle and an id1394_isoch_dmainfo_t structure
 *    (see id1394.h for details) as its input arguments and returns a
 *    t1394_isoch_dma_handle_t that the target driver will use with all
 *    other local host DMA calls.  After allocating a local host DMA
 *    resource, a target driver may start and stop it as often as desired
 *    using the t1394_start_isoch_dma() and t1394_stop_isoch_dma() calls.
 *    The t1394_start_isoch_dma() takes an id1394_isoch_dma_ctrlinfo_t
 *    structure (also discussed in more detail in id1394.h) as an
 *    additional argument to indicate among other things the conditions
 *    under which the host DMA will be started.
 *    The t1394_free_isoch_dma() is used, not surprisingly, to free up
 *    allocate isoch DMA resources.
 *    And the t1394_update_isoch_dma() routine is used to update a running
 *    isochronous stream.  By creating and passing a temporary IXL command
 *    or set of commands and both the kernel virtual addresses of the
 *    temporary and original commands, a target driver can request that the
 *    1394 Framework replace the original field contents with those in the

/*
 * MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES:

 *    etc.  The t1394_get_targetinfo() routine is used to get information
 *    about the target driver's device and about current bus conditions
 *    that might be useful to a target.  By passing the target handle and
 *    current bus generation, a target driver can expect to receive a filled
 *    in t1394_targetinfo_t structure (see above) that contains the
 *    current_max_payload, current_max_speed, and device's nodeID.
 *    The t1394_initiate_bus_reset() routine can be used by target drivers
 *    to initiate a bus reset.  This call should be used only when it is
 *    absolutely imperative, however, as bus resets affect all devices on
 *    the 1394 Serial Bus and excessive use of bus resets can have an
 *    adverse effect on overall bus performance.
 *    The t1394_get_topology_map() will return the TOPOLOGY_MAP (see
 *    IEEE 1394-1995, Section 8.3.2.4.1) which is a list of SelfID packets
 *    from the current bus generation.
 *    The t1394_CRC16() call is used to calculate cyclic redundancy checks
 *    (CRCs) necessary for use in Config ROM buffers.
 *    The t1394_add_cfgrom_entry() and t1394_rem_cfgrom_entry() calls are
 *    used, respectively, to add and remove entries from the local host
 *    Config ROM buffer.  (See above for a description of the
 *    t1394_cfgrom_entryinfo_t structure.)
 *    And the t1394_errmsg() routine is used to convert result codes which
