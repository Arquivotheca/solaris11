 * Targets use id1394_isoch_dmainfo_t with t1394_alloc_isoch_dma() to specify
 * the desired characteristics of the local isochronous DMA resource.
 *
 * ixlp
 *	is the kernel virtual address of the first IXL program command.
 *	For IXL program command structures, see ixl1394.h.
 * channel_num
 *	is the isochronous channel number (0-63) for the allocated local
 *	isochronous DMA resource.  For an isochronous receive DMA resource,
 *	only packets with the specified channel number are received into the
 *	provided buffers.  For an isochronous transmit DMA resource, the
 *	1394 Framework constructs isochronous transmit packet headers using the
 *	specified channel number.
 * default_tag
 *	are the tag bits for the local isochronous DMA resource.
 *	For an isochronous receive DMA resource, only packets with the specified
 *	tag bits are received into the provided buffers.  For an isochronous
 *	transmit DMA resource, the 1394 Framework constructs isochronous
 *	transmit packet headers using the specified tag bits.
 * default_sync
 *	are the sync bits for the local isochronous DMA resource.  Usage is
 *	similar to that of default_tag above.
 * it_speed
 *	is used only for an isochronous transmit resource and indicates the
 *	speed at which the 1394 Framework shall transmit packets.  For valid
 *	speeds, see ieee1394.h.
 * global_callback_arg
 *	is the argument the 1394 Framework provides to the target when invoking
 *	a callback specified in an ixl1394_callback_t IXL command or an IXL
 *	program. Target drivers can use this to track state or any other
 *	information.  See ixl1394.h for IXL command info.
 * it_default_skip
 *	is used for isochronous transmit DMA resources only and specifies the
 *	default skip mode for the resource.  See ixl1394.h for valid skip modes.
 * it_default_skiplabel
 *	is used for isochronous transmit DMA resources only, and when
 *	it_default_skip is IXL1394_SKIP_TO_LABEL.  It contains a pointer to
 *	the targetted IXL Label command.
 * idma_options
 *	is used to specify the overall transmit or receive characteristics
 *	of the requested local isochronous DMA resource.
 * isoch_dma_stopped
 *	is the target driver's callback routine the 1394 Framework is to
 *	invoke if the local isochronous DMA resource stops.
 * idma_evt_arg
 *	is the target driver's callback argument to be handed back to the target
 *	driver when the 1394 Framework invokes the isoch_dma_stopped() callback.
