/*
 * Delta (device) Address Map Interfaces
 *
 * These interfaces provide time-stablized sets of 'addresses',
 * where addresses are string representations of device
 * or bus-specific address.  The mechanisms include interfaces to
 * report and remove address from a map, time stabilization, callouts
 * to higher-level configuration and unconfiguration actions, and
 * address lookup functions.
 *
 * Per Address Reports
 * With per-address reporting, the caller reports the addition and removal of
 * each address visible to it. Each report is independently time stabilized;
 * Once a report has stabilized, the reported address is either
 * activated & configured, or unconfigured & released.
 *
 * Full Set Reports
 * When using fullset reporting, the report provider enumerates the entire
 * set of addresses visible to the provider at a given point in time.
 * The entire set is then stabilized.
 * Upon stabilizing, any newly reported addresses are activated & configured
 * and any previously active addresses which are no longer visible are
 * automatically unconfigured and released, freeing the provider from
 * the need to explicitly unconfigure addresses no longer present.
 *
 * Stabilization
 * Once an address has been reported (or reported as removed), the report
 * is time stabilized before the framework initiates a configuration
 * or unconfiguration action.  If the address is re-reported while undergoing
 * stabilization, the timer is reset for either the address or the full
 * set of addresses reported to the map.
 *
 * Activation/Release
 * Once a reported address has passed its stabilization, the address is
 * 'activated' by the framework.  Once activated, the address is passed
 * to a configuration callout to perform whatever actions are necessary.
 * If a reported address is deleted or fails to stabilize, the address
 * is released by the map.
 * A report provider may register callback functions to be invoked
 * as part of the address activation & release process.  In addition to
 * the callbacks, a provider can also supply a handle to provider-private
 * data at the time an address is reported.  This handle is returned to
 * provider as an argument to the activation & release callbacks.
 *
 * Lookup/Access
 * The set of stable addresses contained in a map can be obtained by
 * calling interfaces to lookup either a single address or the full
 * list of stable addresses.
