/*
 * Session structure overview.
 *
 * Currently, the only structure in the kernel which has a pointer to a
 * session structures is the proc_t via the p_sessp pointer.  To
 * access a session proc_t->p_sessp pointer a caller must hold either
 * pidlock or p_splock.  These locks only protect the p_sessp pointer
 * itself and do not protect any of the contents of the session structure.
 * To prevent the contents of a the session structure from changing the
 * caller must grab s_lock.
 *
 * No callers should ever update the contents of the session structure
 * directly.  Only the session management code should ever modify the
 * contents of the session structure.  When the session code attempts
 * to modify the contents of a session structure it must hold multiple
 * locks.  The locking order for all the locks that may need to be
 * acquired is:
 * 	sd_lock -> pidlock -> p_splock -> s_lock
 *
 * If a caller requires access to a session structure for long
 * periods of time or across operations that may block it should
 * use the tty_hold() and sess_hold() interfaces.
 *
 * sess_hold() returns a pointer to a session structure associated
 * with the proc_t that was passed in.  It also increments the reference
 * count associated with that session structure to ensure that it
 * can't be freed until after the caller is done with it and calls
 * sess_rele().  This hold doesn't actually protect any of the
 * contents of the session structure.
 *
 * tty_hold() returns a pointer to a session structure associated
 * with the curproc.  It also "locks" the contents of the session
 * structure.  This hold should be used when the caller will be
 * doing operations on a controlling tty associated with the session.
 * This operation doesn an implicit sess_hold() so that the session
 * structure can't be free'd until after the caller is done with it
 * and invokes tty_rele().
 *
 * NOTE: Neither of these functions (sess_hold() or tty_hold())
 * prevent a process from changing its session.  Once these functions
 * return a session pointer, that session pointer may no longer be
 * associated with the current process.  If a caller wants to prevent
 * a process from changing its session then it must hold pidlock or
 * p_splock.
