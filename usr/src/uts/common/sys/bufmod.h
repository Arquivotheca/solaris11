/*
 * Definitions for the STREAMS Buffering module.
 *
 * The module gathers incoming (read-side) messages together into
 * "chunks" and passes completed chunks up to the next module in
 * line.  The gathering process is controlled by two ioctl-settable
 * parameters:
 *
 * timeout	The maximum delay after passing the previous chunk
 *		upward before passing the current one up, even if the
 *		chunk isn't full.  If the timeout value passed in is
 *		a null pointer, the timeout is infinite (as in the
 *		select system call); this is the default.
 * chunksize	The maximum size of a chunk of accumulated messages,
 *		unless a single message exceeds the chunksize, in
 *		which case it's passed up in a chunk containing only
 *		that message.  Note that a given message's size includes
 *		the length of any leading M_PROTO blocks it may have.
 *
 * There is one important side-effect: setting the timeout to zero
 * (polling) will force the chunksize to zero, regardless of its
 * previous setting.

/*
 * When adding a given message to an accumulating chunk, the module
 * first converts any leading M_PROTO data block to M_DATA.
 * It then constructs an sb_hdr (defined below), prepends it to
 * the message, and pads the result out to force its length to a
 * multiple of a machine-dependent alignment size guaranteed to be
 * at least sizeof (ulong_t).  It then adds the padded message to the
 * chunk.
 *
 * sb_origlen is the original length of the message after the M_PROTO => M_DATA
 * conversion, but before truncating or adding the header.
 *
 * sb_msglen is the length of the message after truncation, but before
 * adding the header.
 *
 * sb_totlen is the length of the message after truncation, and including
 * both the header itself and the trailing padding bytes.
 *
 * sb_drops is the cumulative number of messages dropped by the module
 * due to stream read-side flow control or resource exhaustion.
 *
 * sb_timestamp is the packet arrival time expressed as a 'struct timeval'.
