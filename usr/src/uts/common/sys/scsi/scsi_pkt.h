	 * The DDI does not allow a driver to allocate it's own scsi_pkt(9S),
	 * a driver should not have *any* compiled in dependencies on
	 * "sizeof (struct scsi_pkt)". If the driver has such dependencies, it
	 * limits SCSA's ability to evolve. The proper way for an HBA to
	 * allocate a scsi_pkt is via scsi_hba_pkt_alloc(9F), or the newer
	 * tran_setup_pkt(9E) interfaces. Allocation rules have been in place
	 * for many years, unfortunately a significant number of drivers
	 * are still broken.
	 *
	 * NB: Until we can trust drivers to follow DDI scsi_pkt(9S) allocation
	 * rules, access to all fields below require special consideration.
	 * Access to these fields is limited to code paths that 'know' correct
	 * scsi_pkt allocation interfaces must have been used. This means that
	 * any target driver access to these fields is suspect, since a target
	 * knows nothing about how an HBA drivers performs scsi_pkt allocation.
	 *
	 * NB: A private scsi_pkt_size() interface has been added to simplify
	 * 'fixing' legacy HBA drivers.  Use of scsi_pkt_size() is only
	 * appropriate when the effort/cost of fixing a legacy driver to use
	 * proper DDI scsi_pkt allocation interfaces is too great given the
	 * remaining driver life. New HBA drivers should *not* use
	 * scsi_pkt_size().
	 *
	 * NB: While HBA drivers with violations are being fixed, in
	 * rare cases access conditioned by scsi_pkt_allocated_correctly() is
	 * permitted.
