/*
 * Data structure overview:
 * The per-thread poll state consists of
 *	one pollstate_t
 *	one pollcache_t
 *	one bitmap with one event bit per fd
 *	a (two-dimensional) hashed array of polldat_t structures - one entry
 *	per fd
 *
 * This conglomerate of data structures interact with
 *	the pollhead which is used by VOP_POLL and pollwakeup
 *	(protected by the PHLOCK, cached array of plocks), and
 *	the fpollinfo list hanging off the fi_list which is used to notify
 *	poll when a cached fd is closed. This is protected by uf_lock.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *	pd_php (pollhead pointer) is set iff (if and only if) the polldat
 *	is on that pollhead. This is modified atomically under pc_lock.
 *
 *	pd_fp (file_t pointer) is set iff the thread is on the fpollinfo
 *	list for that open file.
 *	This is modified atomically under pc_lock.
 *
 *	pd_count is the sum (over all values of i) of pd_ref[i].xf_refcnt.
 *	Iff pd_ref[i].xf_refcnt >= 1 then
 *		ps_pcacheset[i].pcs_pollfd[pd_ref[i].xf_position].fd == pd_fd
 *	Iff pd_ref[i].xf_refcnt > 1 then
 *		In ps_pcacheset[i].pcs_pollfd between index
 *		pd_ref[i].xf_position] and the end of the list
 *		there are xf_refcnt entries with .fd == pd_fd
 *
 * Locking design:
 * Whenever possible the design relies on the fact that the poll cache state
 * is per thread thus for both poll and exit it is self-synchronizing.
 * Thus the key interactions where other threads access the state are:
 *	pollwakeup (and polltime), and
 *	close cleaning up the cached references to an open file
 *
 * The two key locks in poll proper is ps_lock and pc_lock.
 *
 * The ps_lock is used for synchronization between poll, (lwp_)exit and close
 * to ensure that modifications to pollcacheset structure are serialized.
 * This lock is held through most of poll() except where poll sleeps
 * since there is little need to handle closes concurrently with the execution
 * of poll.
 * The pc_lock protects most of the fields in pollcache structure and polldat
 * structures (which are accessed by poll, pollwakeup, and polltime)
 * with the exception of fields that are only modified when only one thread
 * can access this per-thread state.
 * Those exceptions occur in poll when first allocating the per-thread state,
 * when poll grows the number of polldat (never shrinks), and when
 * exit/pollcleanup has ensured that there are no references from either
 * pollheads or fpollinfo to the threads poll state.
 *
 * Poll(2) system call is the only path which ps_lock and pc_lock are both
 * held, in that order. It needs ps_lock to synchronize with close and
 * lwp_exit; and pc_lock with pollwakeup.
 *
 * The locking interaction between pc_lock and PHLOCK take into account
 * that poll acquires these locks in the order of pc_lock and then PHLOCK
 * while pollwakeup does it in the reverse order. Thus pollwakeup implements
 * deadlock avoidance by dropping the locks and reacquiring them in the
 * reverse order. For this to work pollwakeup needs to prevent the thread
 * from exiting and freeing all of the poll related state. Thus is done
 * using
 *	the pc_no_exit lock
 *	the pc_busy counter
 *	the pc_busy_cv condition variable
 *
 * The locking interaction between pc_lock and uf_lock has similar
 * issues. Poll holds ps_lock and/or pc_lock across calls to getf/releasef
 * which acquire uf_lock. The poll cleanup in close needs to hold uf_lock
 * to prevent poll or exit from doing a delfpollinfo after which the thread
 * might exit. But the cleanup needs to acquire pc_lock when modifying
 * the poll cache state. The solution is to use pc_busy and do the close
 * cleanup in two phases:
 *	First close calls pollblockexit which increments pc_busy.
 *	This prevents the per-thread poll related state from being freed.
 *	Then close drops uf_lock and calls pollcacheclean.
 *	This routine can then acquire pc_lock and remove any references
 *	to the closing fd (as well as recording that it has been closed
 *	so that a POLLNVAL can be generated even if the fd is reused before
 *	poll has been woken up and checked getf() again).
 *
 * When removing a polled fd from poll cache, the fd is always removed
 * from pollhead list first and then from fpollinfo list, i.e.,
 * pollhead_delete() is called before delfpollinfo().
 *
 *
 * Locking hierarchy:
 *	pc_no_exit is a leaf level lock.
 *	ps_lock is held when acquiring pc_lock (except when pollwakeup
 *	acquires pc_lock).
 *	pc_lock might be held when acquiring PHLOCK (pollhead_insert/
 *	pollhead_delete)
 *	pc_lock is always held (but this is not required)
 *	when acquiring PHLOCK (in polladd/pollhead_delete and pollwakeup called
 *	from pcache_clean_entry).
 *	pc_lock is held across addfpollinfo/delfpollinfo which acquire
 *	uf_lock.
 *	pc_lock is held across getf/releasef which acquire uf_lock.
 *	ps_lock might be held across getf/releasef which acquire uf_lock.
 *	pollwakeup tries to acquire pc_lock while holding PHLOCK
 *	but drops the locks and reacquire them in reverse order to avoid
 *	deadlock.
 *
 * Note also that there is deadlock avoidance support for VOP_POLL routines
 * and pollwakeup involving a file system or driver lock.
 * See below.
