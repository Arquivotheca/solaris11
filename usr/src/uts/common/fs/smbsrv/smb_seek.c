/*
 * The seek message is sent to set the current file pointer for FID.
 * This request should generally only be used by clients wishing to
 * find the size of a file, since all read and write requests include
 * the read or write file position as part of the SMB. This request
 * is inappropriate for large files, as the offsets specified are only
 * 32 bits.
 *
 * The CIFS/1.0 (1996) spec contains the following incomplete statement:
 *
 * "A seek which results in an Offset which can not be expressed
 *  in 32 bits returns the least significant."
 *
 * It would probably be a mistake to make an assumption about what this
 * statement means. So, for now, we return an error if the resultant
 * file offset is beyond the 32-bit limit.

 * Client Request                     Description
 * ================================== =================================
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 4
 * USHORT Fid;                        File handle
 * USHORT Mode;                       Seek mode: 0, 1 or 2
 * LONG Offset;                       Relative offset
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * The starting point of the seek is set by Mode:
 *
 *      0  seek from start of file
 *      1  seek from current current position
 *      2  seek from end of file
 *
 * The "current position" reflects the offset plus data length specified in
 * the previous read, write or seek request, and the pointer set by this
 * command will be replaced by the offset specified in the next read, write
 * or seek command.
 *
 * Server Response                    Description
 * ================================== =================================
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 2
 * ULONG Offset;                      Offset from start of file
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * The response returns the new file pointer in Offset, which is expressed
 * as the offset from the start of the file, and may be beyond the current
 * end of file. An attempt to seek before the start of the file sets the
 * current file pointer to the start of the file.
