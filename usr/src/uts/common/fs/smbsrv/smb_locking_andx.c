 *  UCHAR AndXCommand;                 Secondary (X) command;  0xFF =

 *
 * Locking is a simple mechanism for excluding other processes read/write
 * access to regions of a file.  The locked regions can be anywhere in the
 * logical file.  Locking beyond end-of-file is permitted.  Any process
 * using the Fid specified in this request's Fid has access to the locked
 * bytes, other processes will be denied the locking of the same bytes.
 *
 * The proper method for using locks is not to rely on being denied read or
 * write access on any of the read/write protocols but rather to attempt
 * the locking protocol and proceed with the read/write only if the locks
 * succeeded.
 *
 * Locking a range of bytes will fail if any subranges or overlapping
 * ranges are locked.  In other words, if any of the specified bytes are
 * already locked, the lock will fail.
 *
 * If NumberOfUnlocks is non-zero, the Unlocks vector contains
 * NumberOfUnlocks elements.  Each element requests that a lock at Offset
 * of Length be released.  If NumberOfLocks is nonzero, the Locks vector
 * contains NumberOfLocks elements.  Each element requests the acquisition
 * of a lock at Offset of Length.
 *
 * Timeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the byte range(s)
 * specified to become unlocked.  A timeout value of 0 indicates that the
 * server should fail immediately if any lock range specified is locked.  A
 *
 * timeout value of -1 indicates that the server should wait as long as it
 * takes for each byte range specified to become unlocked so that it may be
 * again locked by this protocol.  Any other value of smb_timeout specifies
 * the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for all lock range(s)
 * specified to become available.
 *
 * If any of the lock ranges timeout because of the area to be locked is
 * already locked (or the lock fails), the other ranges in the protocol
 * request which were successfully locked as a result of this protocol will
 * be unlocked (either all requested ranges will be locked when this
 * protocol returns to the client or none).
 *
 * If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_SHARED_LOCK flag set, the lock is
 * specified as a shared lock.  Locks for both read and write (where
 * LOCKING_ANDX_SHARED_LOCK is clear) should be prohibited, but other
 * shared locks should be permitted.  If shared locks can not be supported
 * by a server, the server should map the lock to a lock for both read and
 * write.  Closing a file with locks still in force causes the locks to be
 * released in no defined order.
 *
 * If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_LARGE_FILES flag set and if the
 * negotiated protocol is NT LM 0.12 or later, then the Locks and Unlocks
 * vectors are in the Large File LOCKING_ANDX_RANGE format.  This allows
 * specification of 64 bit offsets for very large files.
 *
 * If the one and only member of the Locks vector has the
 * LOCKING_ANDX_CANCEL_LOCK flag set in the LockType field, the client is
 * requesting the server to cancel a previously requested, but not yet
 * responded to, lock.
 *
 * If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_CHANGE_LOCKTYPE flag set, the client is
 * requesting that the server atomically change the lock type from a shared
 * lock to an exclusive lock or vice versa.  If the server can not do this
 * in an atomic fashion, the server must reject this request.  NT and W95
 * servers do not support this capability.
 *
 * Oplocks are described in the "Opportunistic Locks" section elsewhere in
 * this document.  A client requests an oplock by setting the appropriate
 * bit in the SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX request when the file is being opened in a
 * mode which is not exclusive.  The server responds by setting the
 * appropriate bit in the response SMB indicating whether or not the oplock
 * was granted.  By granting the oplock, the server tells the client the
 * file is currently only being used by this one client process at the
 * current time.  The client can therefore safely do read ahead and write
 * behind as well as local caching of file locks knowing that the file will
 * not be accessed/changed in any way by another process while the oplock
 * is in effect.  The client will be notified when any other process
 * attempts to open or modify the oplocked file.
 *
 * When another user attempts to open or otherwise modify the file which a
 * client has oplocked, the server delays the second attempt and notifies
 * the client via an SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB asynchronously sent from the
 * server to the client.  This message has the LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE
 * flag set indicating to the client that the oplock is being broken.
 *
 * OplockLevel indicates the type of oplock the client now owns. If
 * OplockLevel is 0, the client possesses no oplocks on the file at all, if
 * OplockLevel is 1 the client possesses a Level II oplock.  The client is
 * expected to flush any dirty buffers to the server, submit any file locks
 * and respond to the server with either an SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB having the
 * LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE flag set, or with a file close if the file
 * is no longer in use by the client.  If the client sends an
 * SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB with the LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE flag set and
 * NumberOfLocks is zero, the server does not send a response.  Since a
 * close being sent to the server and break oplock notification from the
 * server could cross on the wire, if the client gets an oplock
 * notification on a file which it does not have open, that notification
 * should be ignored.
 *
 * Due to timing, the client could get an "oplock broken" notification in a
 * user's data buffer as a result of this notification crossing on the wire
 * with a SMB_COM_READ_RAW request.  The client must detect this (use
 * length of msg, "FFSMB", MID of -1 and Command of SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX)
 * and honor the "oplock broken" notification as usual.  The server must
 * also note on receipt of an SMB_COM_READ_RAW request that there is an
 * outstanding (unanswered) "oplock broken" notification to the client and
 * return a zero length response denoting failure of the read raw request.
 * The client should (after responding to the "oplock broken"
 * notification), use a standard read protocol to redo the read request.
 * This allows a file to actually contain data matching an "oplock broken"
 * notification and still be read correctly.
 *
 * The entire message sent and received including the optional second
 * protocol must fit in the negotiated maximum transfer size.  The
 * following are the only valid SMB commands for AndXCommand for
 * SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX:
 *
 *     SMB_COM_READ       SMB_COM_READ_ANDX
 *     SMB_COM_WRITE      SMB_COM_WRITE_ANDX
 *     SMB_COM_FLUSH
 *
 * 4.2.6.1   Errors

 * ERRDOS/ERRbadfile
 * ERRDOS/ERRbadfid
 * ERRDOS/ERRlock
 * ERRDOS/ERRinvdevice
 * ERRSRV/ERRinvid
