 * SMB: process_exit
 *
 * This command informs the server that a client process has terminated.
 * The server must close all files opened by Pid in the SMB header.  This
 * must automatically release all locks the process holds.
 *
 * Client Request                     Description
 * ================================== =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 0
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * Server Response                    Description
 * ================================== =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 0
 *  USHORT ByteCount;                 Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * This SMB should not generate any errors from the server, unless the
 * server is a user mode server and Uid in the SMB header is invalid.
 *
 * Clients are not required to send this SMB, they can do all cleanup
 * necessary by sending close SMBs to the server to release resources.  In
 * fact, clients who have negotiated LANMAN 1.0 and later probably do not
 * send this message at all.
