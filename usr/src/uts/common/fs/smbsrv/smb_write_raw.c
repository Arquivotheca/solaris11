 * SMB: write_raw
 * 5.27       WRITE_RAW: Write Raw Bytes
 *
 * The Write Block Raw protocol is used to maximize the performance of
 * writing a large block of data from the client to the server.  The Write
 * Block Raw command's scope includes files, Named Pipes, and spooled
 * output (can be used in place COM_WRITE_PRINT_FILE ).
 *
 *  Client Request              Description
 *  ==========================  =========================================
 *
 *  UCHAR WordCount;            Count of parameter words = 12
 *  USHORT Fid;                 File handle
 *  USHORT Count;               Total bytes, including this buffer
 *  USHORT Reserved;
 *  ULONG Offset;               Offset in file to begin write
 *  ULONG Timeout;
 *  USHORT WriteMode;           Write mode:
 *                              bit 0 - complete write to disk and send
 *                              final result response
 *                              bit 1 - return Remaining (pipe/dev)
 *                              (see WriteAndX for #defines)
 *  ULONG Reserved2;
 *  USHORT DataLength;          Number of data bytes this buffer
 *  USHORT DataOffset;          Offset (from header start) to data
 *  USHORT ByteCount;           Count of data bytes
 *  UCHAR Pad[];                Pad to SHORT or LONG
 *  UCHAR Data[];               Data (# = DataLength)
 *
 *  First Server Response          Description
 *  ============================== =====================================
 *
 *  UCHAR WordCount;               Count of parameter words = 1
 *  USHORT Remaining;              Bytes remaining to be read if pipe
 *  USHORT ByteCount;              Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 *  Final Server Response              Description
 *  ================================== =================================
 *
 *  UCHAR Command (in SMB header)      SMB_COM_WRITE_COMPLETE
 *
 *  UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 1
 *  USHORT Count;                      Total number of bytes written
 *  USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * The first response format will be that of the final server response in
 * the case where the server gets an error while writing the data sent
 * along with the request.  Thus Count is the number of bytes which did get
 * written any time an error is returned.  If an error occurs after the
 * first response has been sent allowing the client to send the remaining
 * data, the final response should not be sent unless write through is set.
 * Rather the server should return this "write behind" error on the next
 * access to the Fid.
 *
 * The client must guarantee that there is (and will be) no other request
 * on the connection for the duration of this request.  The server will
 * reserve enough resources to receive the data and respond with a response
 * SMB as defined above.  The client then sends the raw data in one send.
 * Thus the server is able to receive up to 65,535 bytes of data directly
 * into the server buffer.  The amount of data transferred is expected to
 * be larger than the negotiated buffer size for this protocol.
 *
 * The reason that no other requests can be active on the connection for
 * the duration of the request is that if other receives are present on the
 * connection, there is normally no way to guarantee that the data will be
 * received into the correct server buffer, rather the data may fill one
 * (or more) of the other buffers.  Also if the client is sending other
 * requests on the connection, a request may land in the buffer that the
 * server has allocated for the this SMB's data.
 *
 * Whether or not SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW is supported is returned in the
 * response to SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE.  SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW is not supported for
 * connectionless clients.
 *
 * When write through is not specified ((WriteMode & 01) == 0) this SMB is
 * assumed to be a form of write behind.  The transport layer guarantees
 * delivery of all secondary requests from the client.  Thus no "got the
 * data you sent" SMB is needed.  If an error should occur at the server
 * end, all bytes must be received and thrown away.  If an error occurs
 * while writing data to disk such as disk full, the next access of the
 * file handle (another write, close, read, etc.) will return the fact that
 * the error occurred.
 *
 * If write through is specified ((WriteMode & 01) != 0), the server will
 * receive the data, write it to disk and then send a final response
 * indicating the result of the write.  The total number of bytes written
 * is also returned in this response in the Count field.
 *
 * The flow for the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW SMB is:
 *
 * client -----> SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW request (optional data) >-------> server
 * client <------------------< OK send (more) data <---------------- server
 * client  ----------------------> raw data >----------------------> server
 * client  <---< data on disk or error (write through only) <------- server
 *
 * This protocol is set up such that the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW request may also
 * carry data.  This is an optimization in that up to the server's buffer
 * size (MaxCount from SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response), minus the size of the
 * SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW SMB request, may be sent along with the request.  Thus
 * if the server is busy and unable to support the raw write of the
 * remaining data, the data sent along with the request has been delivered
 * and need not be sent again.  The server will write any data sent in the
 * request (and wait for it to be on the disk or device if write through is
 * set), prior to sending the response.
 *
 * The specific responses error class ERRSRV, error codes ERRusempx and
 * ERRusestd, indicate that the server is temporarily out of the resources
 *
 * needed to support the raw write of the remaining data, but that any data
 * sent along with the request has been successfully written.  The client
 * should then write the remaining data using a different type of SMB write
 * request, or delay and retry using SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW.  If a write error
 * occurs writing the initial data, it will be returned and the write raw
 * request is implicitly denied.
 *
 * The return field Remaining is returned for named pipes only.  It is used
 * to return the number of bytes currently available in the pipe.  This
 * information can then be used by the client to know when a subsequent
 * (non blocking) read of the pipe may return some data.  Of course when
 * the read request is actually received by the server there may be more or
 * less actual data in the pipe (more data has been written to the pipe /
 * device or another reader drained it).  If the information is currently
 * not available or the request is NOT for a pipe or the server does not
 * support this feature, a -1 value should be returned.
 *
 * If the negotiated dialect is NT LM 0.12 or later, and the response to
 * the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE SMB has CAP_LARGE_FILES set in the Capabilities
 * field, an additional request format is allowed which accommodates very
 * large files having 64 bit offsets:
 *
 *  Client Request                     Description
 *  ================================== =================================

 *                                      and send final result response
 *                                      bit 1 - return Remaining
 *                                      (pipe/dev)
 *   ULONG Reserved2;
 *   USHORT DataLength;                Number of data bytes this buffer
 *   USHORT DataOffset;                Offset (from header start) to
 *                                      data
 *   ULONG OffsetHigh;                 Upper 32 bits of offset
 *   USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes
 *   UCHAR Pad[];                       Pad to SHORT or LONG
 *   UCHAR Data[];                     Data (# = DataLength)
 *
 * In this case the final offset in the file is formed by combining
 * OffsetHigh and Offset, the resulting offset must not be negative.
