/*
 * Below is the SMBFS-specific representation of a "node".
 * This struct is a mixture of Sun NFS and Darwin code.
 * Fields starting with "r_" came from NFS struct "rnode"
 * and fields starting with "n_" came from Darwin, or
 * were added during the Solaris port.  We have avoided
 * renaming fields so we would not cause excessive
 * changes in the code using this struct.
 *
 * Now using an AVL tree instead of hash lists, but kept the
 * "hash" in some member names and functions to reduce churn.
 * One AVL tree per mount replaces the global hash buckets.
 *
 * Notes carried over from the NFS code:
 *
 * The smbnode is the "inode" for remote files.  It contains all the
 * information necessary to handle remote file on the client side.
 *
 * Note on file sizes:  we keep two file sizes in the smbnode: the size
 * according to the client (r_size) and the size according to the server
 * (r_attr.fa_size).  They can differ because we modify r_size during a
 * write system call (smbfs_rdwr), before the write request goes over the
 * wire (before the file is actually modified on the server).  If an OTW
 * request occurs before the cached data is written to the server the file
 * size returned from the server (r_attr.fa_size) may not match r_size.
 * r_size is the one we use, in general.  r_attr.fa_size is only used to
 * determine whether or not our cached data is valid.
 *
 * Each smbnode has 3 locks associated with it (not including the smbnode
 * "hash" AVL tree and free list locks):
 *
 *	r_rwlock:	Serializes smbfs_write and smbfs_setattr requests
 *			and allows smbfs_read requests to proceed in parallel.
 *			Serializes reads/updates to directories.
 *
 *	r_lkserlock:	Serializes lock requests with map, write, and
 *			readahead operations.
 *
 *	r_statelock:	Protects all fields in the smbnode except for
 *			those listed below.  This lock is intented
 *			to be held for relatively short periods of
 *			time (not accross entire putpage operations,
 *			for example).
 *
 * The following members are protected by the mutex smbfreelist_lock:
 *	r_freef
 *	r_freeb
 *
 * The following members are protected by the AVL tree rwlock:
 *	r_avl_node	(r__hdr.hdr_avl_node)
 *
 * Note: r_modaddr is only accessed when the r_statelock mutex is held.
 *	Its value is also controlled via r_rwlock.  It is assumed that
 *	there will be only 1 writer active at a time, so it safe to
 *	set r_modaddr and release r_statelock as long as the r_rwlock
 *	writer lock is held.
 *
 * 64-bit offsets: the code formerly assumed that atomic reads of
 * r_size were safe and reliable; on 32-bit architectures, this is
 * not true since an intervening bus cycle from another processor
 * could update half of the size field.  The r_statelock must now
 * be held whenever any kind of access of r_size is made.
 *
 * Lock ordering:
 * 	r_rwlock > r_lkserlock > r_statelock
