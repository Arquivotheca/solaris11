/*
 * TPI Sockets
 * ======================
 *
 * A TPI socket can be created by the TPI socket module, or as a
 * result of fallback. In either case, the TPI related information is
 * stored in a sotpi_info_t. Sockets that are TPI based from the
 * beginning will use a sotpi_sonode_t, but fallback case the
 * sotpi_info_t will be allocated when needed. However, the so_priv
 * field in the sonode will always point to the sotpi_info_t, and the
 * structure should only be accessed via so_priv. Use SOTOTPI().
 *
 * A TPI socket always corresponds to a VCHR stream representing the
 * transport provider (e.g. /dev/tcp). This information is retrieved
 * from the kernel socket configuration table and accessible via
 * so_sockparams->sp_sdev_info.  sockfs uses this to perform
 * VOP_ACCESS checks before allowing an open of the transport
 * provider.
 *
 * AF_UNIX Sockets
 * -------------------------
 *
 * When an AF_UNIX socket is bound to a pathname the sockfs creates a
 * VSOCK vnode in the underlying file system. However, the vnodeops
 * etc in this VNODE remain those of the underlying file system.
 * Sockfs uses the v_stream pointer in the underlying file system
 * VSOCK node to find the sonode bound to the pathname. The bound
 * pathname vnode is accessed through sti_ux_vp.
 *
 * Out of Band Data Handling
 * -------------------------
 *
 * The counts (sti_oobcnt and sti_oobsigcnt) track the number of
 * urgent indicates that are (logically) queued on the stream head
 * read queue. The urgent data is queued on the stream head
 * as follows.
 *
 * In the normal case the SIGURG is not generated until
 * the T_EXDATA_IND arrives at the stream head. However, transports
 * that have an early indication that urgent data is pending
 * (e.g. TCP receiving a "new" urgent pointer value) can send up
 * an M_PCPROTO/SIGURG message to generate the signal early.
 *
 * The mark is indicated by either:
 *  - a T_EXDATA_IND (with no M_DATA b_cont) with MSGMARK set.
 *    When this message is consumed by sorecvmsg the socket layer
 *    sets SS_RCVATMARK until data has been consumed past the mark.
 *  - a message with MSGMARKNEXT set (indicating that the
 *    first byte of the next message constitutes the mark). When
 *    the last byte of the MSGMARKNEXT message is consumed in
 *    the stream head the stream head sets STRATMARK. This flag
 *    is cleared when at least one byte is read. (Note that
 *    the MSGMARKNEXT messages can be of zero length when there
 *    is no previous data to which the marknext can be attached.)
 *
 * While the T_EXDATA_IND method is the common case which is used
 * with all TPI transports, the MSGMARKNEXT method is needed to
 * indicate the mark when e.g. the TCP urgent byte has not been
 * received yet but the TCP urgent pointer has made TCP generate
 * the M_PCSIG/SIGURG.
 *
 * The signal (the M_PCSIG carrying the SIGURG) and the mark
 * indication can not be delivered as a single message, since
 * the signal should be delivered as high priority and any mark
 * indication must flow with the data. This implies that immediately
 * when the SIGURG has been delivered if the stream head queue is
 * empty it is impossible to determine if this will be the position
 * of the mark. This race condition is resolved by using MSGNOTMARKNEXT
 * messages and the STRNOTATMARK flag in the stream head. The
 * SIOCATMARK code calls the stream head to wait for either a
 * non-empty queue or one of the STR*ATMARK flags being set.
 * This implies that any transport that is sending M_PCSIG(SIGURG)
 * should send the appropriate MSGNOTMARKNEXT message (which can be
 * zero length) after sending an M_PCSIG to prevent SIOCATMARK
 * from sleeping unnecessarily.
