/*
 * This file defines pre-defined and system common named pipes.
 *
 * Named pipes are a simple IPC mechanism supported by Windows 9x, NT
 * and 2000. The Windows named pipe implementation supports reliable
 * one-way and two-way transport independent network messaging. The
 * names follow the universal naming convention (UNC) defined for the
 * Windows redirector: \\[server]\[share]\[path]name. There is a good
 * overview of named pipes in Network Programming for Microsoft Windows
 * Chapter 4. The redirector is described in Chapter 2. UNC names are
 * case-insensitive.

 *
 * Microsoft RPC, which is derived from DCE RPC, uses SMB named pipes
 * as its transport mechanism. In addition to the pipe used to open
 * each connection, a named pipe also appears in the bind response as
 * a secondary address port. Sometimes the secondary address port is
 * the same and sometimes it is different. The following associations
 * have been observed.
 *
 *		LSARPC		lsass
 *		NETLOGON	lsass
 *		SAMR		lsass
 *		SPOOLSS		spoolss
 *		SRVSVC		ntsvcs
 *		SVCCTL		ntsvcs
 *		WINREG		winreg
 *		WKSSVC		ntsvcs
 *		EVENTLOG	ntsvcs
 *		LLSRPC		llsrpc
 *

 * references.
