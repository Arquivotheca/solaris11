 * Mailslots are a one-way, unreliable IPC mechanism that allows a
 * client to send or broadcast messages to a server. The names follow
 * the same universal naming convention (UNC) used with named pipes:
 * \\server\mailslot\name, \\.\mailslot\name etc. There is a good
 * overview of mailslots, including limitations of NT and Windows 2000,
 * in Network Programming for Microsoft Windows Chapter 3.
