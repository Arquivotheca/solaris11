 * Processor Groups: Hardware sharing relationship layer
 *
 * This file implements an extension to Processor Groups to capture
 * hardware sharing relationships existing between logical CPUs. Examples of
 * hardware sharing relationships include shared caches on some CMT
 * procesoor architectures, or shared local memory controllers on NUMA
 * based system architectures.
 *
 * The pghw_t structure represents the extended PG. The first member
 * of the structure is the generic pg_t with the pghw specific members
 * following. The generic pg_t *must* remain the first member of the
 * structure as the code uses casting of structure references to access
 * the generic pg_t structure elements.
 *
 * In addition to the generic CPU grouping, physical PGs have a hardware
 * sharing relationship enumerated "type", and an instance id. The enumerated
 * type is defined by the pghw_type_t enumeration, while the instance id
 * uniquely identifies the sharing instance from among others of the same
 * hardware sharing type.
 *
 * The physical PGs are organized into an overall hierarchy, and are tracked
 * in a number of different per CPU, and per pghw_type_t type groups.
 * As an example:
 *

 * | pg_hw     |
 * | (group_t) |
 * -------------

 *
 * The top level pg_hw is a group of "hwset" groups. Each hwset holds of group
 * of physical PGs of the same hardware sharing type. Within each hwset, the
 * PG's instance id uniquely identifies the grouping relationshsip among other
 * groupings of the same sharing type. The instance id for a grouping is
 * platform defined, and in some cases may be used by platform code as a handle
 * to search for a particular relationship instance.
 *
 * Each physical PG (by virtue of the embedded pg_t) contains a group of CPUs
 * that participate in the sharing relationship. Each CPU also has associated
 * with it a grouping tracking the PGs in which the CPU belongs. This can be
 * used to iterate over the various relationships in which the CPU participates
 * (the CPU's chip, cache, lgroup, etc.).
 *
 * The hwsets are created dynamically as new hardware sharing relationship types
 * are instantiated. They are never destroyed, as once a given relationship
 * type appears in the system, it is quite likely that at least one instance of
 * that relationship will always persist as long as the system is running.
