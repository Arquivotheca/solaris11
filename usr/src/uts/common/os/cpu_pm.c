/*
 * Solaris Event Based CPU Power Manager
 *
 * This file implements platform independent event based CPU power management.
 * When CPUs are configured into the system, the CMT scheduling subsystem will
 * query the platform to determine if the CPU belongs to any power management
 * domains. That is, sets of CPUs that share power management states.
 *
 * Active Power Management domains represent a group of CPUs across which the
 * Operating System can request speed changes (which may in turn result
 * in voltage changes). This allows the operating system to trade off
 * performance for power savings.
 *
 * Idle Power Management domains can enter power savings states when they are
 * unutilized. These states allow the Operating System to trade off power
 * for performance (in the form of latency to transition from the idle state
 * to an active one).
 *
 * For each active and idle power domain the CMT subsystem instantiates, a
 * cpupm_domain_t structure is created. As the dispatcher schedules threads
 * to run on the system's CPUs, it will also track the utilization of the
 * enumerated power domains. Significant changes in utilization will result
 * in the dispatcher sending the power manager events that relate to the
 * utilization of the power domain. The power manager recieves the events,
 * and in the context of the policy objectives in force, may decide to request
 * the domain's power/performance state be changed.
 *
 * Under the "elastic" CPUPM policy, when the utilization rises, the CPU power
 * manager will request the CPUs in the domain run at their fastest (and most
 * power consuming) state. When the domain becomes idle (utilization at zero),
 * the power manager will request that the CPUs run at a speed that saves the
 * most power.
 *
 * The advantage of this scheme, is that the CPU power manager working with the
 * dispatcher can be extremely responsive to changes in utilization. Optimizing
 * for performance in the presence of utilization, and power savings in the
 * presence of idleness. Such close collaboration with the dispatcher has other
 * benefits that will play out in the form of more sophisticated power /
 * performance policy in the near future.
 *
 * Avoiding state thrashing in the presence of transient periods of utilization
 * and idleness while still being responsive to non-transient periods is key.
 * The power manager implements a "governor" that is used to throttle
 * state transitions when a significant amount of transient idle or transient
 * work is detected.
 *
 * Kernel background activity (e.g. taskq threads) are by far the most common
 * form of transient utilization. Ungoverned in the face of this utililzation,
 * hundreds of state transitions per second would result on an idle system.
 *
 * Transient idleness is common when a thread briefly yields the CPU to
 * wait for an event elsewhere in the system. Where the idle period is short
 * enough, the overhead associated with making the state transition doesn't
 * justify the power savings.
 *
 * The following is the state machine for the governor implemented by
 * cpupm_utilization_event():
 *
 *         ----->---tw---->-----
 *        /                     \
 *      (I)-<-ti-<-     -<-ntw-<(W)
 *       |         \   /         |
 *       \          \ /          /
 *        >-nti/rm->(D)--->-tw->-
 * Key:
 *
 * States
 * - (D): Default (ungoverned)
 * - (W): Transient work governed
 * - (I): Transient idle governed
 * State Transitions
 * - tw: transient work
 * - ti: transient idleness
 * - ntw: non-transient work
 * - nti: non-transient idleness
 * - rm: thread remain event
