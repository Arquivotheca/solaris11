/*
 * When the operating system detects that it is in an invalid state, a panic
 * is initiated in order to minimize potential damage to user data and to
 * facilitate debugging.  There are three major tasks to be performed in
 * a system panic: recording information about the panic in memory (and thus
 * making it part of the crash dump), synchronizing the file systems to
 * preserve user file data, and generating the crash dump.  We define the
 * system to be in one of four states with respect to the panic code:
 *
 * CALM    - the state of the system prior to any thread initiating a panic
 *
 * QUIESCE - the state of the system when the first thread to initiate
 *           a system panic records information about the cause of the panic
 *           and renders the system quiescent by stopping other processors
 *
 * SYNC    - the state of the system when we synchronize the file systems
 * DUMP    - the state when we generate the crash dump.
 *
 * The transitions between these states are irreversible: once we begin
 * panicking, we only make one attempt to perform the actions associated with
 * each state.
 *
 * The panic code itself must be re-entrant because actions taken during any
 * state may lead to another system panic.  Additionally, any Solaris
 * thread may initiate a panic at any time, and so we must have synchronization
 * between threads which attempt to initiate a state transition simultaneously.
 * The panic code makes use of a special locking primitive, a trigger, to
 * perform this synchronization.  A trigger is simply a word which is set
 * atomically and can only be set once.  We declare three triggers, one for
 * each transition between the four states.  When a thread enters the panic
 * code it attempts to set each trigger; if it fails it moves on to the
 * next trigger.  A special case is the first trigger: if two threads race
 * to perform the transition to QUIESCE, the losing thread may execute before
 * the winner has a chance to stop its CPU.  To solve this problem, we have
 * the loser look ahead to see if any other triggers are set; if not, it
 * presumes a panic is underway and simply spins.  Unfortunately, since we
 * are panicking, it is not possible to know this with absolute certainty.
 *
 * There are two common reasons for re-entering the panic code once a panic
 * has been initiated: (1) after we debug_enter() at the end of QUIESCE,
 * the operator may type "sync" instead of "go", and the PROM's sync callback
 * routine will invoke panic(); (2) if the clock routine decides that sync
 * or dump is not making progress, it will invoke panic() to force a timeout.
 * The design assumes that a third possibility, another thread causing an
 * unrelated panic while sync or dump is still underway, is extremely unlikely.
 * If this situation occurs, we may end up triggering dump while sync is
 * still in progress.  This third case is considered extremely unlikely because
 * all other CPUs are stopped and low-level interrupts have been blocked.
 *
 * The panic code is entered via a call directly to the vpanic() function,
 * or its varargs wrappers panic() and cmn_err(9F).  The vpanic routine
 * is implemented in assembly language to record the current machine
 * registers, attempt to set the trigger for the QUIESCE state, and
 * if successful, switch stacks on to the panic_stack before calling into
 * the common panicsys() routine.  The first thread to initiate a panic
 * is allowed to make use of the reserved panic_stack so that executing
 * the panic code itself does not overwrite valuable data on that thread's
 * stack *ahead* of the current stack pointer.  This data will be preserved
 * in the crash dump and may prove invaluable in determining what this
 * thread has previously been doing.  The first thread, saved in panic_thread,
 * is also responsible for stopping the other CPUs as quickly as possible,
 * and then setting the various panic_* variables.  Most important among
 * these is panicstr, which allows threads to subsequently bypass held
 * locks so that we can proceed without ever blocking.  We must stop the
 * other CPUs *prior* to setting panicstr in case threads running there are
 * currently spinning to acquire a lock; we want that state to be preserved.
 * Every thread which initiates a panic has its T_PANIC flag set so we can
 * identify all such threads in the crash dump.
 *
 * The panic_thread is also allowed to make use of the special memory buffer
 * panicbuf, which on machines with appropriate hardware is preserved across
 * reboots.  We allow the panic_thread to store its register set and panic
 * message in this buffer, so even if we fail to obtain a crash dump we will
 * be able to examine the machine after reboot and determine some of the
 * state at the time of the panic.  If we do get a dump, the panic buffer
 * data is structured so that a debugger can easily consume the information
 * therein (see <sys/panic.h>).
 *
 * Each platform or architecture is required to implement the functions
 * panic_savetrap() to record trap-specific information to panicbuf,
 * panic_saveregs() to record a register set to panicbuf, panic_stopcpus()
 * to halt all CPUs but the panicking CPU, panic_quiesce_hw() to perform
 * miscellaneous platform-specific tasks *after* panicstr is set,
 * panic_showtrap() to print trap-specific information to the console,
 * and panic_dump_hw() to perform platform tasks prior to calling dumpsys().
 *
 * A Note on Word Formation, courtesy of the Oxford Guide to English Usage:
 *
 * Words ending in -c interpose k before suffixes which otherwise would
 * indicate a soft c, and thus the verb and adjective forms of 'panic' are
 * spelled "panicked", "panicking", and "panicky" respectively.  Use of
 * the ill-conceived "panicing" and "panic'd" is discouraged.
