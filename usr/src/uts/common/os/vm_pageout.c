	 * scanned per sec using ~10% of processor time.  Since this
	 * value depends on the processor, MMU, Mhz etc., it is
	 * difficult to determine it in a generic manner for all
	 * architectures.
	 *
	 * Instead of trying to determine the number of pages scanned
	 * per sec for every processor, fastscan is set to be the smaller
	 * of 1/2 of memory or MAXHANDSPREADPAGES and the sampling
	 * time is limited to ~4% of processor time.
	 *
	 * Setting fastscan to be 1/2 of memory allows pageout to scan
	 * all of memory in ~2 secs.  This implies that user pages not
	 * accessed within 1 sec (assuming, handspreadpages == fastscan)
	 * can be reclaimed when free memory is very low.  Stealing pages
	 * not accessed within 1 sec seems reasonable and ensures that
	 * active user processes don't thrash.
	 *
	 * Smaller values of fastscan result in scanning fewer pages
	 * every second and consequently pageout may not be able to free
	 * sufficient memory to maintain the minimum threshold.  Larger
	 * values of fastscan result in scanning a lot more pages which
	 * could lead to thrashing and higher CPU usage.
	 *
	 * Fastscan needs to be limited to a maximum value and should not
	 * scale with memory to prevent pageout from consuming too much
	 * time for scanning on slow CPU's and avoid thrashing, as a
	 * result of scanning too many pages, on faster CPU's.
	 * The value of 64 Meg was chosen for MAXHANDSPREADPAGES
	 * (the upper bound for fastscan) based on the average number
	 * of pages that can potentially be scanned in ~1 sec (using ~4%
	 * of the CPU) on some of the following machines that currently
	 * run Solaris 2.x:
	 *
	 *			average memory scanned in ~1 sec
	 *
	 *	25 Mhz SS1+:		23 Meg
	 *	LX:			37 Meg
	 *	50 Mhz SC2000:		68 Meg
	 *
	 *	40 Mhz 486:		26 Meg
	 *	66 Mhz 486:		42 Meg
	 *
	 * When free memory falls just below lotsfree, the scan rate
	 * goes from 0 to slowscan (i.e., pageout starts running).  This
	 * transition needs to be smooth and is achieved by ensuring that
	 * pageout scans a small number of pages to satisfy the transient
	 * memory demand.  This is set to not exceed 100 pages/sec (25 per
	 * wakeup) since scanning that many pages has no noticible impact
	 * on system performance.
	 *
	 * In addition to setting fastscan and slowscan, pageout is
	 * limited to using ~4% of the CPU.  This results in increasing
	 * the time taken to scan all of memory, which in turn means that
	 * user processes have a better opportunity of preventing their
	 * pages from being stolen.  This has a positive effect on
	 * interactive and overall system performance when memory demand
	 * is high.
	 *
	 * Thus, the rate at which pages are scanned for replacement will
	 * vary linearly between slowscan and the number of pages that
	 * can be scanned using ~4% of processor time instead of varying
	 * linearly between slowscan and fastscan.
	 *
	 * Also, the processor time used by pageout will vary from ~1%
	 * at slowscan to ~4% at fastscan instead of varying between
	 * ~1% at slowscan and ~10% at fastscan.
	 *
	 * The values chosen for the various VM parameters (fastscan,
	 * handspreadpages, etc) are not universally true for all machines,
	 * but appear to be a good rule of thumb for the machines we've
	 * tested.  They have the following ranges:
	 *
	 *	cpu speed:	20 to 70 Mhz
	 *	page size:	4K to 8K
	 *	memory size:	16M to 5G
	 *	page scan rate:	4000 - 17400 4K pages per sec
	 *
	 * The values need to be re-examined for machines which don't
	 * fall into the various ranges (e.g., slower or faster CPUs,
	 * smaller or larger pagesizes etc) shown above.
	 *
	 * On an MP machine, pageout is often unable to maintain the
	 * minimum paging thresholds under heavy load.  This is due to
	 * the fact that user processes running on other CPU's can be
	 * dirtying memory at a much faster pace than pageout can find
	 * pages to free.  The memory demands could be met by enabling
	 * more than one CPU to run the clock algorithm in such a manner
	 * that the various clock hands don't overlap.  This also makes
	 * it more difficult to determine the values for fastscan, slowscan
	 * and handspreadpages.
	 *
	 * The swapper is currently used to free up memory when pageout
	 * is unable to meet memory demands by swapping out processes.
	 * In addition to freeing up memory, swapping also reduces the
	 * demand for memory by preventing user processes from running
	 * and thereby consuming memory.
