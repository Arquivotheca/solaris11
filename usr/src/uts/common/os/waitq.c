/*
 * Operations on waitq_t structures.
 *
 * A wait queue is a singly linked NULL-terminated list with doubly
 * linked circular sublists.  The singly linked list is in descending
 * priority order and FIFO for threads of the same priority.  It links
 * through the t_link field of the thread structure.  The doubly linked
 * sublists link threads of the same priority.  They use the t_priforw
 * and t_priback fields of the thread structure.
 *
 * Graphically (with priorities in parens):
 *
 *         ________________           _______                   _______
 *        /                \         /       \                 /       \
 *        |                |         |       |                 |       |
 *        v                v         v       v                 v       v
 *     t1(60)-->t2(60)-->t3(60)-->t4(50)-->t5(50)-->t6(30)-->t7(0)-->t8(0)
 *        ^      ^  ^      ^         ^       ^       ^  ^      ^       ^
 *        |      |  |      |         |       |       |  |      |       |
 *        \______/  \______/         \_______/       \__/      \_______/
 *
 * There are three interesting operations on a waitq list: inserting
 * a thread into the proper position according to priority; removing a
 * thread given a pointer to it; and walking the list, possibly
 * removing threads along the way.  This design allows all three
 * operations to be performed efficiently and easily.
 *
 * To insert a thread, traverse the list looking for the sublist of
 * the same priority as the thread (or one of a lower priority,
 * meaning there are no other threads in the list of the same
 * priority).  This can be done without touching all threads in the
 * list by following the links between the first threads in each
 * sublist.  Given a thread t that is the head of a sublist (the first
 * thread of that priority found when following the t_link pointers),
 * t->t_priback->t_link points to the head of the next sublist.  It's
 * important to do this since a waitq may contain thousands of
 * threads.
 *
 * Removing a thread from the list is also efficient.  First, the
 * t_waitq field contains a pointer to the waitq on which a thread
 * is waiting (or NULL if it's not on a waitq).  This is used to
 * determine if the given thread is on the given waitq without
 * searching the list.  Assuming it is, if it's not the head of a
 * sublist, just remove it from the sublist and use the t_priback
 * pointer to find the thread that points to it with t_link.  If it is
 * the head of a sublist, search for it by walking the sublist heads,
 * similar to searching for a given priority level when inserting a
 * thread.
 *
 * To walk the list, simply follow the t_link pointers.  Removing
 * threads along the way can be done easily if the code maintains a
 * pointer to the t_link field that pointed to the thread being
 * removed.
