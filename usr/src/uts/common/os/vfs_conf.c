/*
 * WARNING: THE POSITIONS OF FILESYSTEM TYPES IN THIS TABLE SHOULD NOT
 * BE CHANGED. These positions are used in generating fsids and
 * fhandles.  Thus, changing positions will cause a server to change
 * the fhandle it gives out for a file.  It is okay to reuse formerly
 * used slots, just be sure that we're not going to start supporting
 * the former owner of the slot again.
 *
 * Since there's been some question about whether the above comment is
 * true, let's provide more detail.  Most filesystems call
 * vfs_make_fsid with two arguments that go into making the fsid: the
 * dev number, and the fs type number - which is the offset of the
 * filesystem's entry in the below table.  If you would like to check
 * if the position of the filesystem in this table still affects the
 * fsid, just check what arguments filesystems are calling
 * vfs_make_fsid with.
 *
 * The scenario we're trying to prevent here is:
 *
 * NFS server gets upgraded to new kernel version with different vfssw
 * Clients are -not- rebooted, still retain filehandles
 * NFS server boots up and now the fsid of an exported fs is different
 *  --> Clients get stale file handle errors
