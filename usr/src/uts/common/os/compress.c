 *
 * This compression algorithm is a derivative of LZRW1, which I'll call
 * LZJB in the classic LZ* spirit.  All LZ* (Lempel-Ziv) algorithms are
 * based on the same basic principle: when a "phrase" (sequences of bytes)
 * is repeated in a data stream, we can save space by storing a reference to
 * the previous instance of that phrase (a "copy item") rather than storing
 * the phrase itself (a "literal item").  The compressor remembers phrases
 * in a simple hash table (the "Lempel history") that maps three-character
 * sequences (the minimum match) to the addresses where they were last seen.
 *
 * A copy item must encode both the length and the location of the matching
 * phrase so that decompress() can reconstruct the original data stream.
 * For example, here's how we'd encode "yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah"
 * (with "_" replacing spaces for readability):
 *
 * Original:
 *
 * y a d d a _ y a d d a _ y a d d a , _ b l a h _ b l a h _ b l a h
 *
 * Compressed:
 *
 * y a d d a _ 6 11 , _ b l a h 5 10
 *
 * In the compressed output, the "6 11" simply means "to get the original
 * data, execute memmove(ptr, ptr - 6, 11)".  Note that in this example,
 * the match at "6 11" actually extends beyond the current location and
 * overlaps it.  That's OK; like memmove(), decompress() handles overlap.
 *
 * There's still one more thing decompress() needs to know, which is how to
 * distinguish literal items from copy items.  We encode this information
 * in an 8-bit bitmap that precedes each 8 items of output; if the Nth bit
 * is set, then the Nth item is a copy item.  Thus the full encoding for
 * the example above would be:
 *
 * 0x40 y a d d a _ 6 11 , 0x20 _ b l a h 5 10
 *
 * Finally, the "6 11" isn't really encoded as the two byte values 6 and 11
 * in the output stream because, empirically, we get better compression by
 * dedicating more bits to offset, fewer to match length.  LZJB uses 6 bits
 * to encode the match length, 10 bits to encode the offset.  Since copy-item
 * encoding consumes 2 bytes, we don't generate copy items unless the match
 * length is at least 3; therefore, we can store (length - 3) in the 6-bit
 * match length field, which extends the maximum match from 63 to 66 bytes.
 * Thus the 2-byte encoding for a copy item is as follows:
 *
 *	byte[0] = ((length - 3) << 2) | (offset >> 8);
 *	byte[1] = (uint8_t)offset;
 *
 * In our example above, an offset of 6 with length 11 would be encoded as:
 *
 *	byte[0] = ((11 - 3) << 2) | (6 >> 8) = 0x20
 *	byte[1] = (uint8_t)6 = 0x6
 *
 * Similarly, an offset of 5 with length 10 would be encoded as:
 *
 *	byte[0] = ((10 - 3) << 2) | (5 >> 8) = 0x1c
 *	byte[1] = (uint8_t)5 = 0x5
 *
 * Putting it all together, the actual LZJB output for our example is:
 *
 * 0x40 y a d d a _ 0x2006 , 0x20 _ b l a h 0x1c05
 *
 * The main differences between LZRW1 and LZJB are as follows:
 *
 * (1) LZRW1 is sloppy about buffer overruns.  LZJB never reads past the
 *     end of its input, and never writes past the end of its output.
 *
 * (2) LZJB allows a maximum match length of 66 (vs. 18 for LZRW1), with
 *     the trade-off being a shorter look-behind (1K vs. 4K for LZRW1).
 *
 * (3) LZJB records only the low-order 16 bits of pointers in the Lempel
 *     history (which is all we need since the maximum look-behind is 1K),
 *     and uses only 256 hash entries (vs. 4096 for LZRW1).  This makes
 *     the compression hash small enough to allocate on the stack, which
 *     solves two problems: (1) it saves 64K of kernel/cprboot memory,
 *     and (2) it makes the code MT-safe without any locking, since we
 *     don't have multiple threads sharing a common hash table.
 *
 * (4) LZJB is faster at both compression and decompression, has a
 *     better compression ratio, and is somewhat simpler than LZRW1.
 *
 * Finally, note that LZJB is non-deterministic: given the same input,
 * two calls to compress() may produce different output.  This is a
 * general characteristic of most Lempel-Ziv derivatives because there's
 * no need to initialize the Lempel history; not doing so saves time.
