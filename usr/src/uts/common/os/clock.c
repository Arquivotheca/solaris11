 * The service historically provided by the lbolt and lbolt64 variables has

 * original symbols removed from the system. The once clock driven variables are
 * now implemented in an event driven fashion, backed by gethrtime() coarsed to
 * the appropriate clock resolution. The default event driven implementation is
 * complemented by a cyclic driven one, active only during periods of intense
 * activity around the DDI lbolt routines, when a lbolt specific cyclic is
 * reprogramed to fire at a clock tick interval to serve consumers of lbolt who
 * rely on the original low cost of consulting a memory position.
 *
 * The implementation uses the number of calls to these routines and the
 * frequency of these to determine when to transition from event to cyclic
 * driven and vice-versa. These values are kept on a per CPU basis for
 * scalability reasons and to prevent CPUs from constantly invalidating a single
 * cache line when modifying a global variable. The transition from event to
 * cyclic mode happens once the thresholds are crossed, and activity on any CPU
 * can cause such transition.
 *
 * The lbolt_hybrid function pointer is called by ddi_get_lbolt() and
 * ddi_get_lbolt64(), and will point to lbolt_event_driven() or
 * lbolt_cyclic_driven() according to the current mode. When the thresholds
 * are exceeded, lbolt_event_driven() will reprogram the lbolt cyclic to
 * fire at a nsec_per_tick interval and increment an internal variable at
 * each firing. lbolt_hybrid will then point to lbolt_cyclic_driven(), which
 * will simply return the value of such variable. lbolt_cyclic() will attempt
 * to shut itself off at each threshold interval (sampling period for calls
 * to the DDI lbolt routines), and return to the event driven mode, but will
 * be prevented from doing so if lbolt_cyclic_driven() is being heavily used.
 *
 * lbolt_bootstrap is used during boot to serve lbolt consumers who don't wait
 * for the cyclic subsystem to be intialized.

 * integrates successive PPS phase differences and calculates the
 * frequency offset. This is used in clock() to discipline the CPU
 * clock oscillator so that intrinsic frequency error is cancelled out.
 * The code requires the caller to capture the time and hardware counter
 * value at the on-time PPS signal transition.
 *
 * Note that, on some Unix systems, this routine runs at an interrupt
 * priority level higher than the timer interrupt routine clock().
 * Therefore, the variables used are distinct from the clock()
 * variables, except for certain exceptions: The PPS frequency pps_freq
 * and phase pps_offset variables are determined by this routine and
 * updated atomically. The time_tolerance variable can be considered a
 * constant, since it is infrequently changed, and then only when the
 * PPS signal is disabled. The watchdog counter pps_valid is updated
 * once per second by clock() and is atomically cleared in this
 * routine.
 *
 * tvp is the time of the last tick; usec is a microsecond count since the
 * last tick.
 *
 * Note: In Solaris systems, the tick value is actually given by
 *       usec_per_tick.  This is called from the serial driver cdintr(),
