# rdc_bitmap_mode
# - Sets the mode of the RDC bitmap operation, acceptable values are:
#   0 - autodetect bitmap mode depending on the state of SDBC (default).
#   1 - force bitmap writes for every write operation, so an update resync
#       can be performed after a crash or reboot.
#   2 - only write the bitmap on shutdown, so a full resync is
#       required after a crash, but an update resync is required after
#       a reboot.
#
rdc_bitmap_mode=1;

#
# rdc_max_sets
# - Configure the maximum number of RDC sets that can be enabled on
#   this host.  The actual maximum number of sets that can be enabled
#   will be the minimum of this value and nsc_max_devices (see
#   nsctl.conf) at the time the rdc kernel module is loaded.
#
rdc_max_sets=64;

#
# rdc_health_thres
# - Set the timeout (in seconds) for RDC health monitoring. If IPMP is in
#   use over the RDC link this value should be set higher than in.mpathd's
#   timeout.
#
#rdc_health_thres=20;
