 * Device Contracts
 * -----------------
 * This file contains the core code for the device contracts framework.
 * A device contract is an agreement or a contract between a process and
 * the kernel regarding the state of the device. A device contract may be
 * created when a relationship is formed between a device and a process
 * i.e. at open(2) time, or it may be created at some point after the device
 * has been opened. A device contract once formed may be broken by either party.
 * A device contract can be broken by the process by an explicit abandon of the
 * contract or by an implicit abandon when the process exits. A device contract
 * can be broken by the kernel either asynchronously (without negotiation) or
 * synchronously (with negotiation). Exactly which happens depends on the device
 * state transition. The following state diagram shows the transitions between
 * device states. Only device state transitions currently supported by device
 * contracts is shown.
 *
 *                              <-- A -->
 *                       /-----------------> DEGRADED
 *                       |                      |
 *                       |                      |
 *                       |                      | S
 *                       |                      | |
 *                       |                      | v
 *                       v       S -->          v
 *                      ONLINE ------------> OFFLINE
 *
 *
 * In the figure above, the arrows indicate the direction of transition. The
 * letter S refers to transitions which are inherently synchronous i.e.
 * require negotiation and the letter A indicates transitions which are
 * asynchronous i.e. are done without contract negotiations. A good example
 * of a synchronous transition is the ONLINE -> OFFLINE transition. This
 * transition cannot happen as long as there are consumers which have the
 * device open. Thus some form of negotiation needs to happen between the
 * consumers and the kernel to ensure that consumers either close devices
 * or disallow the move to OFFLINE. Certain other transitions such as
 * ONLINE --> DEGRADED for example, are inherently asynchronous i.e.
 * non-negotiable. A device that suffers a fault that degrades its
 * capabilities will become degraded irrespective of what consumers it has,
 * so a negotiation in this case is pointless.
 *
 * The following device states are currently defined for device contracts:
 *
 *      CT_DEV_EV_ONLINE
 *              The device is online and functioning normally
 *      CT_DEV_EV_DEGRADED
 *              The device is online but is functioning in a degraded capacity
 *      CT_DEV_EV_OFFLINE
 *              The device is offline and is no longer configured
 *
 * A typical consumer of device contracts starts out with a contract
 * template and adds terms to that template. These include the
 * "acceptable set" (A-set) term, which is a bitset of device states which
 * are guaranteed by the contract. If the device moves out of a state in
 * the A-set, the contract is broken. The breaking of the contract can
 * be asynchronous in which case a critical contract event is sent to the
 * contract holder but no negotiations take place. If the breaking of the
 * contract is synchronous, negotations are opened between the affected
 * consumer and the kernel. The kernel does this by sending a critical
 * event to the consumer with the CTE_NEG flag set indicating that this
 * is a negotiation event. The consumer can accept this change by sending
 * a ACK message to the kernel. Alternatively, if it has the necessary
 * privileges, it can send a NACK message to the kernel which will block
 * the device state change. To NACK a negotiable event, a process must
 * have the {PRIV_SYS_DEVICES} privilege asserted in its effective set.
 *
 * Other terms include the "minor path" term, specified explicitly if the
 * contract is not being created at open(2) time or specified implicitly
 * if the contract is being created at open time via an activated template.
 *
 * A contract event is sent on any state change to which the contract
 * owner has subscribed via the informative or critical event sets. Only
 * critical events are guaranteed to be delivered. Since all device state
 * changes are controlled by the kernel and cannot be arbitrarily generated
 * by a non-privileged user, the {PRIV_CONTRACT_EVENT} privilege does not
 * need to be asserted in a process's effective set to designate an event as
 * critical. To ensure privacy, a process must either have the same effective
 * userid as the contract holder or have the {PRIV_CONTRACT_OBSERVER} privilege
 * asserted in its effective set in order to observe device contract events
 * off the device contract type specific endpoint.
 *
 * Yet another term available with device contracts is the "non-negotiable"
 * term. This term is used to pre-specify a NACK to any contract negotiation.
 * This term is ignored for asynchronous state changes. For example, a
 * provcess may have the A-set {ONLINE|DEGRADED} and make the contract
 * non-negotiable. In this case, the device contract framework assumes a
 * NACK for any transition to OFFLINE and blocks the offline. If the A-set
 * is {ONLINE} and the non-negotiable term is set, transitions to OFFLINE
 * are NACKed but transitions to DEGRADE succeed.
 *
 * The OFFLINE negotiation (if OFFLINE state is not in the A-set for a contract)
 * happens just before the I/O framework attempts to offline a device
 * (i.e. detach a device and set the offline flag so that it cannot be
 * reattached). A device contract holder is expected to either NACK the offline
 * (if privileged) or release the device and allow the offline to proceed.
 *
 * The DEGRADE contract event (if DEGRADE is not in the A-set for a contract)
 * is generated just before the I/O framework transitions the device state
 * to "degraded" (i.e. DEVI_DEVICE_DEGRADED in I/O framework terminology).
 *
 * The contract holder is expected to ACK or NACK a negotiation event
 * within a certain period of time. If the ACK/NACK is not received
 * within the timeout period, the device contract framework will behave
 * as if the contract does not exist and will proceed with the event.
 *
 * Unlike a process contract a device contract does not need to exist
 * once it is abandoned, since it does not define a fault boundary. It
 * merely represents an agreement between a process and the kernel
 * regarding the state of the device. Once the process has abandoned
 * the contract (either implicitly via a process exit or explicitly)
 * the kernel has no reason to retain the contract. As a result
 * device contracts are neither inheritable nor need to exist in an
 * orphan state.
 *
 * A device unlike a process may exist in multiple contracts and has
 * a "life" outside a device contract. A device unlike a process
 * may exist without an associated contract. Unlike a process contract
 * a device contract may be formed after a binding relationship is
 * formed between a process and a device.
 *
 *	IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 *	====================
 * DATA STRUCTURES
 * ----------------
 * 	The heart of the device contracts implementation is the device contract
 * 	private cont_device_t (or ctd for short) data structure. It encapsulates
 * 	the generic contract_t data structure and has a number of private
 *	fields.
 * 	These include:
 *		cond_minor: The minor device that is the subject of the contract
 *		cond_aset:  The bitset of states which are guaranteed by the
 *			   contract
 *		cond_noneg: If set, indicates that the result of negotiation has
 *			    been predefined to be a NACK
 * 	In addition, there are other device identifiers such the devinfo node,
 * 	dev_t and spec_type of the minor node. There are also a few fields that
 * 	are used during negotiation to maintain state. See
 *		uts/common/sys/contract/device_impl.h
 * 	for details.
 * 	The ctd structure represents the device private part of a contract of
 * 	type "device"
 *
 * 	Another data structure used by device contracts is ctmpl_device. It is
 * 	the device contracts private part of the contract template structure. It
 *	encapsulates the generic template structure "ct_template_t" and includes
 *	the following device contract specific fields
 *		ctd_aset:   The bitset of states that should be guaranteed by a
 *			    contract
 *		ctd_noneg:  If set, indicates that contract should NACK a
 *			    negotiation
 *		ctd_minor:  The devfs_path (without the /devices prefix) of the
 *			    minor node that is the subject of the contract.
 *
 * ALGORITHMS
 * ---------
 * There are three sets of routines in this file
 * 	Template related routines
 * 	-------------------------
 *	These routines provide support for template related operations initated
 *	via the generic template operations. These include routines that dup
 *	a template, free it, and set various terms in the template
 *	(such as the minor node path, the acceptable state set (or A-set)
 *	and the non-negotiable term) as well as a routine to query the
 *	device specific portion of the template for the abovementioned terms.
 *	There is also a routine to create (ctmpl_device_create) that is used to
 *	create a contract from a template. This routine calls (after initial
 *	setup) the common function used to create a device contract
 *	(contract_device_create).
 *
 *	core device contract implementation
 *	----------------------------------
 *	These routines support the generic contract framework to provide
 *	functionality that allows contracts to be created, managed and
 *	destroyed. The contract_device_create() routine is a routine used
 *	to create a contract from a template (either via an explicit create
 *	operation on a template or implicitly via an open with an
 *	activated template.). The contract_device_free() routine assists
 *	in freeing the device contract specific parts. There are routines
 *	used to abandon (contract_device_abandon) a device contract as well
 *	as a routine to destroy (which despite its name does not destroy,
 *	it only moves a contract to a dead state) a contract.
 *	There is also a routine to return status information about a
 *	contract - the level of detail depends on what is requested by the
 *	user. A value of CTD_FIXED only returns fixed length fields such
 *	as the A-set, state of device and value of the "noneg" term. If
 *	CTD_ALL is specified, the minor node path is returned as well.
 *
 *	In addition there are interfaces (contract_device_ack/nack) which
 *	are used to support negotiation between userland processes and
 *	device contracts. These interfaces record the acknowledgement
 *	or lack thereof for negotiation events and help determine if the
 *	negotiated event should occur.
 *
 *	"backend routines"
 *	-----------------
 *	The backend routines form the interface between the I/O framework
 *	and the device contract subsystem. These routines, allow the I/O
 *	framework to call into the device contract subsystem to notify it of
 *	impending changes to a device state as well as to inform of the
 *	final disposition of such attempted state changes. Routines in this
 *	class include contract_device_offline() that indicates an attempt to
 *	offline a device, contract_device_degrade() that indicates that
 *	a device is moving to the degraded state and contract_device_negend()
 *	that is used by the I/O framework to inform the contracts subsystem of
 *	the final disposition of an attempted operation.
 *
 *	SUMMARY
 *	-------
 *      A contract starts its life as a template. A process allocates a device
 *	contract template and sets various terms:
 *		The A-set
 *		The device minor node
 *		Critical and informative events
 *		The noneg i.e. no negotition term
 *	Setting of these terms in the template is done via the
 *	ctmpl_device_set() entry point in this file. A process can query a
 *	template to determine the terms already set in the template - this is
 *	facilitated by the ctmpl_device_get() routine.
 *
 *	Once all the appropriate terms are set, the contract is instantiated via
 *	one of two methods
 *	- via an explicit create operation - this is facilitated by the
 *	  ctmpl_device_create() entry point
 *	- synchronously with the open(2) system call - this is achieved via the
 *	  contract_device_open() routine.
 *	The core work for both these above functions is done by
 *	contract_device_create()
 *
 *	A contract once created can be queried for its status. Support for
 *	status info is provided by both the common contracts framework and by
 *	the "device" contract type. If the level of detail requested is
 *	CTD_COMMON, only the common contract framework data is used. Higher
 *	levels of detail result in calls to contract_device_status() to supply
 *	device contract type specific status information.
 *
 *	A contract once created may be abandoned either explicitly or implictly.
 *	In either case, the contract_device_abandon() function is invoked. This
 * 	function merely calls contract_destroy() which moves the contract to
 *	the DEAD state. The device contract portion of destroy processing is
 *	provided by contract_device_destroy() which merely disassociates the
 *	contract from its device devinfo node. A contract in the DEAD state is
 *	not freed. It hanbgs around until all references to the contract are
 *	gone. When that happens, the contract is finally deallocated. The
 *	device contract specific portion of the free is done by
 *	contract_device_free() which finally frees the device contract specific
 *	data structure (cont_device_t).
 *
 *	When a device undergoes a state change, the I/O framework calls the
 *	corresponding device contract entry point. For example, when a device
 *	is about to go OFFLINE, the routine contract_device_offline() is
 *	invoked. Similarly if a device moves to DEGRADED state, the routine
 *	contract_device_degrade() function is called. These functions call the
 *	core routine contract_device_publish(). This function determines via
 *	the function is_sync_neg() whether an event is a synchronous (i.e.
 *	negotiable) event or not. In the former case contract_device_publish()
 *	publishes a CTE_NEG event and then waits in wait_for_acks() for ACKs
 *	and/or NACKs from contract holders. In the latter case, it simply
 *	publishes the event and does not wait. In the negotiation case, ACKs or
 *	NACKs from userland consumers results in contract_device_ack_nack()
 *	being called where the result of the negotiation is recorded in the
 *	contract data structure. Once all outstanding contract owners have
 *	responded, the device contract code in wait_for_acks() determines the
 *	final result of the negotiation. A single NACK overrides all other ACKs
 *	If there is no NACK, then a single ACK will result in an overall ACK
 *	result. If there are no ACKs or NACKs, then the result CT_NONE is
 *	returned back to the I/O framework. Once the event is permitted or
 *	blocked, the I/O framework proceeds or aborts the state change. The
 *	I/O framework then calls contract_device_negend() with a result code
 *	indicating final disposition of the event. This call releases the
 *	barrier and other state associated with the previous negotiation,
 *	which permits the next event (if any) to come into the device contract
 *	framework.
 *
 *	Finally, a device that has outstanding contracts may be removed from
 *	the system which results in its devinfo node being freed. The devinfo
 *	free routine in the I/O framework, calls into the device contract
 *	function - contract_device_remove_dip(). This routine, disassociates
 *	the dip from all contracts associated with the contract being freed,
 *	allowing the devinfo node to be freed.
 *
 * LOCKING
 * ---------
 * 	There are four sets of data that need to be protected by locks
 *
 *	i) device contract specific portion of the contract template - This data
 *	is protected by the template lock ctmpl_lock.
 *
 *	ii) device contract specific portion of the contract - This data is
 *	protected by the contract lock ct_lock
 *
 *	iii) The linked list of contracts hanging off a devinfo node - This
 *	list is protected by the per-devinfo node lock devi_ct_lock
 *
 *	iv) Finally there is a barrier, controlled by devi_ct_lock, devi_ct_cv
 *	and devi_ct_count that controls state changes to a dip
 *
 *	The template lock is independent in that none of the other locks in this
 *	file may be taken while holding the template lock (and vice versa).
 *
 *	The remaining three locks have the following lock order
 *
 *	devi_ct_lock  -> ct_count barrier ->  ct_lock

 * negotiations are complete.
 *
 * When an event occurs on a minor node, this routine walks the list of
 * contracts hanging off a devinfo node and for each contract on the affected
 * dip, evaluates the following cases
 *
 *	a. an event that is synchronous, breaks the contract and NONEG not set
 *		- bumps up the outstanding negotiation counts on the dip
 *		- marks the dip as undergoing negotiation (devi_ct_neg)
 *		- event of type CTE_NEG is published
 *	b. an event that is synchronous, breaks the contract and NONEG is set
 *		- sets the final result to CT_NACK, event is blocked
 *		- does not publish an event
 *	c. event is asynchronous and breaks the contract
 *		- publishes a critical event irrespect of whether the NONEG
 *		  flag is set, since the contract will be broken and contract
 *		  owner needs to be informed.
 *	d. No contract breakage but the owner has subscribed to the event
 *		- publishes the event irrespective of the NONEG event as the
 *		  owner has explicitly subscribed to the event.
 *	e. NEGEND event
 *		- publishes a critical event. Should only be doing this if
 *		  if NONEG is not set.
 *	f. all other events
 *		- Since a contract is not broken and this event has not been
 *		  subscribed to, this event does not need to be published for
 *		  for this contract.
 *
 *	Once an event is published, what happens next depends on the type of
 *	event:
 *
 *	a. NEGEND event
 *		- cleanup all state associated with the preceding negotiation
 *		  and return CT_ACK to the caller of contract_device_publish()
 *	b. NACKed event
 *		- One or more contracts had the NONEG term, so the event was
 *		  blocked. Return CT_NACK to the caller.
 *	c. Negotiated event
 *		- Call wait_for_acks() to wait for responses from contract
 *		holders. The end result is either CT_ACK (event is permitted),
 *		CT_NACK (event is blocked) or CT_NONE (no contract owner)
 *		responded. This result is returned back to the caller.
 *	d. All other events
 *		- If the event was asynchronous (i.e. not negotiated) or
 *		a contract was not broken return CT_ACK to the caller.
