/*
 * map_addr_proc() is the routine called when the system is to
 * choose an address for the user.  We will pick an address
 * range which is just below the current stack limit.  The
 * algorithm used for cache consistency on machines with virtual
 * address caches is such that offset 0 in the vnode is always
 * on a shm_alignment'ed aligned address.  Unfortunately, this
 * means that vnodes which are demand paged will not be mapped
 * cache consistently with the executable images.  When the
 * cache alignment for a given object is inconsistent, the
 * lower level code must manage the translations so that this
 * is not seen here (at the cost of efficiency, of course).
 *
 * Every mapping will have a redzone of a single page on either side of
 * the request. This is done to leave one page unmapped between segments.
 * This is not required, but it's useful for the user because if their
 * program strays across a segment boundary, it will catch a fault
 * immediately making debugging a little easier.  Currently the redzone
 * is mandatory.
 *
 *
 * addrp is a value/result parameter.
 *	On input it is a hint from the user to be used in a completely
 *	machine dependent fashion.  For MAP_ALIGN, addrp contains the
 *	minimal alignment, which must be some "power of two" multiple of
 *	pagesize.
 *
 *	On output it is NULL if no address can be found in the current
 *	processes address space or else an address that is currently
 *	not mapped for len bytes with a page of red zone on either side.
 *	If vacalign is true, then the selected address will obey the alignment
 *	constraints of a vac machine based on the given off value.
