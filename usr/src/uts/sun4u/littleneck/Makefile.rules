#	This Makefile defines the build rules for the directory 
#	uts/sun4u/littleneck and its children.
#
#	The following two-level ordering must be maintained in this file.
#	  Lines are sorted first in order of decreasing specificity based on
#	  the first directory component.  That is, sun4u rules come before
#	  sparc rules come before common rules.
#
#	  Lines whose initial directory components are equal are sorted
#	  alphabetically by the remaining components.

#
#	Section 1a: C object build rules
#
