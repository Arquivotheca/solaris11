# Configuration file for "rmc_comm" driver
#

#
# The following are needed by our parent (ebus), but OBP should
# have already created them.  So they should only be specified
# here if you have an old version of OBP that didn't do this ...
#
#device_type = "serial";
#interrupts = 1;

#
# Various debugging options interpreted by the rmc_comm driver itself ...
#
# 'baud-rate' (int) specifies the speed of the serial link between
# the host and the RMC.  Obviously, it must be the same as the value
# selected by the RMC; getting it wrong will prevent any communication
# with the RMC.  The default is 38400, which is the value used by the
# standard version of the RMC firmware.
#
#baud-rate = 38400;
#
# 'debug' (int) is a bit-mask for turning on various traces from
# different parts of the driver.  Only available if the driver
# was compiled with DEBUG enabled.
#
#debug = 0;
