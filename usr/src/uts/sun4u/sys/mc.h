/*
 * Interface of Memory Controller driver
 *
 * Logical view: memory -> segment -> bank -> device group -> device
 * physical view: mc -> device group -> device
 *
 * MCIOC_MEM, MCIOC_SEG, MCIOC_CTRLCONF, MCIOC_CONTROL are
 * associated with various length struct. If given number is less than the
 * number in kernel, kernel will update the number and return EINVAL so that
 * user could allocate enough space for the struct and fill the right number
 * of ids at the struct.
 *
 * All varaiable number ids will be paired, global and local. Global id is
 * unique in the same object list and local id is only unique to
 * its upper layer. For instance, one memory module group has N memory modules.
 * local ids of this memory module group is from 0 to N - 1, but global id
 * is unique in all memory modules. So global id will be the key in the list
 * and pass it to driver to search. Local id will be returned to user
 * application via ioctl.
