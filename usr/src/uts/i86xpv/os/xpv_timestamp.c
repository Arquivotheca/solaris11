/*
 * On the hypervisor, we have a virtualized system time based upon the
 * information provided for each VCPU, which is updated every time it is
 * scheduled onto a real CPU.  Thus, none of the traditional code in
 * i86pc/os/timestamp.c applies, our gethrtime() implementation is run through
 * the PSM, and there is no scaling step to apply.
 *
 * However, the platform does not guarantee monotonicity; thus we have to fake
 * this up, which is a deeply unpleasant thing to have to do.
 *
 * Note that the virtualized interface still relies on the current TSC to
 * calculate the time in nanoseconds since the VCPU was scheduled, and is thus
 * subject to all the problems with that.  For the most part, the hypervisor is
 * supposed to deal with them.
 *
 * Another wrinkle involves suspend/resume/migration.  If we come back and time
 * is apparently less, we may have resumed on a different machine or on the
 * same machine after a reboot.  In this case we need to maintain an addend to
 * ensure time continues reasonably.  Otherwise we could end up taking a very
 * long time to expire cyclics in the heap.  Thus we have two functions:
 *
 * xpv_getsystime()
 *
 *	The unadulterated system time from the hypervisor.  This is only to be
 *	used when programming the hypervisor (setting a timer or calculating
 *	the TOD).
 *
 * xpv_gethrtime()
 *
 *	This is the monotonic hrtime counter to be used by everything else such
 *	as the cyclic subsystem.  We should never pass an hrtime directly into
 *	a hypervisor interface, as hrtime_addend may well be non-zero.
