 * MAXVINTRS is the number of interrupts we require to be allocated
 * in the system intr_vec_table in addition to the hardware interrupts.
 * These interrupts will be used by the sun4v cnex driver for its Logical
 * Domain Channels. Each LDC requires a pair of interrupts, (RX/TX),
 * and the total number of interrupts required will depend on the
 * resources available to the system (CPUs, memory, etc) and how
 * the system domains are configured, (number of virtual disks/networks
 * per domain etc).
 *
 * The service domain requires (at least) a console LDC, Domain Services
 * LDCs, vdisk LDC and vnet LDC per guest domain. It also requires a small
 * number of LDCs for communications with the SP etc.
 *
 * The number of LDCs required is ~(N * 4 + a few more) where N is the
 * possible maximum guest domains. The current possible maximum
 * number of domains is 512, so we require ~2048 LDCs. And as
 * each LDC requires a pair of interrupts we need to add the
 * capacity for ~4096 interrupts to the system interrupt table.
 *
 * We start allocating the LDC interrupts at MINVINTR_COOKIE.
