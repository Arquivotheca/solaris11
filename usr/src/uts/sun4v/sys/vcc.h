/*
 * vcc and vntsd exchange information using ioctl commands. When vntsd starts,
 * it uses VCC_NUM_CONSOLE to get number of existing ports and
 * VCC_CONS_TBL to obtain the table of existing consoles. In this table,
 * vcc returns information about each of the console ports using vcc_console_t
 * structure. Vntsd then sleeps on polling vcc control port.
 *
 * When there is a change in configuration, such as addtion or deletion
 * of a console port, vcc wakes up vntsd via the poll events. Subsequently,
 * vntsd uses VCC_INQUIRY ioctl to determine the reason for wakeup. In
 * response to the inquiry, vcc provides a vcc_response_t structure
 * containing reason and port number.
 *
 * If a port is being added or updated (group change), vntsd uses
 * VCC_CONS_INFO ioctl with port number to obtain configuration of
 * the port.
 *
 * If the port is being deleted, vntsd uses VCC_DEL_CONS_OK ioctl to notify
 * vcc after its clean up is done. Vcc subsequently tears down
 * its internal configuration and remove the associated TTY minor node.
 *
 * Only one open is allowd for each vcc port. If vntsd opens a port that is
 * already open, vntsd will use VNTSD_FORCE_CLOSE to take port from other
 * application
