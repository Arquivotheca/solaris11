/*
 * Functions used for executing the I²C protocol.
 *
 * Caller should provide a vector of function calls which can
 * be called to perform the following low-level functions:
 *
 *	set_scl()	set SCL line 0 or 1
 *	set_sda()	set SDA line 0 or 1
 *	get_scl()	return SCL line
 *	get_sda()	return SDA line
 *	ddc_clk()	wait for 'n' clock periods.  'n' is usually 1
 *			and the period is typically 2.5-40 µsec, but this
 *			value is up to the implementation.  One bus cycle
 *			is four clock periods, so the minimum allowable
 *			period is 2.5 µsec (100 kHz bus clock).
 *	clock_interval	integer field specifying the clock period in µsec.
 *	clock_stretch	integer field specifying maximum clock stretch
 *			time in µsec.  Typically 10000.
 *
 * All functions accept two arbitrary arguments which may be used
 * to pass one pointer and one integer value.  These might typically
 * be used to pass a device softc structure and a unit number.
 *
 * All functions which return an int will return 0 on success, error code
 * on failure.
 *
 * Caller should use mutex locking to ensure that two threads do not
 * attempt to simultaneously access the device.  The regular device
 * mutex should usually not be used for this purpose if avoidable, as this
 * protocol can take a considerable amount of time to execute.
