/*
 * mutex_enter() assumes that the mutex is adaptive and tries to grab the
 * lock by doing an ldstub on byte 0 of the mutex.  If the ldstub fails,
 * it means that either (1) the lock is a spin lock, or (2) the lock is
 * adaptive but already held.  mutex_vector_enter() distinguishes these
 * cases by looking at the mutex type, which is byte 7 for both types.
 *
 * Once the lock byte is set for an adaptive lock, the owner is stuffed
 * into the remaining 24 bits such that the owner word is 0xff:owner24.
 * This works because a thread pointer only has 24 significant bits: the
 * upper 3 bits are 111 (since all kernel addresses are above 0xe0000000),
 * and the lower 5 bits are zero (because threads are 32-byte aligned).
