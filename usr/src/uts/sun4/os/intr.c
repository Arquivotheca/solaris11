 *	Weighted interrupt distribution provides two things: "spread" of weight

 *
 *	An interrupt weight is a subjective number that represents the
 *	percentage of a CPU required to service a device's interrupts: the
 *	default weight is 0% (however the algorithm still maintains
 *	round-robin), a network interface controller (NIC) may have a large
 *	weight (35%). Interrupt weight only has meaning relative to the
 *	interrupt weight of other devices: a CPU can be weighted more than
 *	100%, and a single device might consume more than 100% of a CPU.
 *
 *	A coarse interrupt weight can be defined by the parent nexus driver
 *	based on bus specific information, like pci class codes. A nexus
 *	driver that supports device interrupt weighting for its children
 *	should call intr_dist_cpuid_add/rem_device_weight(), which adds
 *	and removes the weight of a device from the CPU that an interrupt
 *	is directed at.  The quality of initialization improves when the
 *	device interrupt weights more accuracy reflect actual run-time weights,
 *	and as the assignments are ordered from is heavy to light.
 *
 *	The implementation also supports interrupt weight being specified in
 *	driver.conf files via the property "ddi-intr-weight", which takes
 *	precedence over the nexus supplied weight.  This support is added to
 *	permit possible tweaking in the product in response to customer
 *	problems. This is not a formal or committed interface.
 *
 *	While a weighted approach chooses the CPU providing the best spread
 *	given past weights, less than optimal isolation can result in cases
 *	where heavy weight devices show up last. The nexus driver's interrupt
 *	redistribution logic should use intr_dist_add/rem_weighted so that
