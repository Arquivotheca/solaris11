/*
 * Debugging macros
 *
 * The DPRINTF macro can be used by setting the debug_print_level to the
 * appropriate debugging level.  The debug levels are defined in each source
 * file where this header file is included.  The scoping of debug_info,
 * and debug_print_level is to the file which included the header file.
 * If multiple levels need to be output, the values can be 'ored'
 * together into debug_print_level.  If debug_print_line's bit 1 is set, the
 * line number of the debugging statement is printed out. If it has
 * bit 2 set, the macro will drop into either the debugger or the OBP PROM.
