/*
 * Locking strategy for high-resolution timing services
 *
 * We generally construct timestamps from two or more components:
 * a hardware time source and one or more software time sources.
 * These components cannot all be loaded simultaneously, so we need
 * some sort of locking strategy to generate consistent timestamps.
 *
 * To minimize lock contention and cache thrashing we employ the
 * weakest possible synchronization model: writers (rare) serialize
 * on an acquisition-counting mutex, described below; readers (common)
 * execute in parallel with no synchronization at all -- they don't
 * exclude other readers, and they don't even exclude writers.  Instead,
 * readers just examine the writer lock's value before and after loading
 * all the components of a timestamp to detect writer intervention.
 * In the rare case when a writer does intervene, the reader will
 * detect it, discard the timestamp and try again.
 *
 * The writer lock, hrt->hres_lock, is a 32-bit integer consisting of an
 * 8-bit lock and a 24-bit acquisition count.  To acquire the lock we
 * set the lock field with ldstub, which sets the low-order 8 bits to
 * 0xff; to clear the lock, we increment it, which simultaneously clears
 * the lock field (0xff --> 0x00) and increments the acquisition count
 * (due to carry into bit 8).  Thus each acquisition transforms hrt->hres_lock
 * from N:0 to N:ff, and each release transforms N:ff into (N+1):0.
 *
 * Readers can detect writer intervention by loading hrt->hres_lock before
 * and after loading the time components they need; if either lock value
 * contains 0xff in the low-order bits (lock held), or if the lock values
 * are not equal (lock was acquired and released), a writer intervened
 * and the reader must try again.  If the lock values are equal and the
 * low-order 8 bits are clear, the timestamp must be valid.  We can check
 * both of these conditions with a single compare instruction by checking
 * whether old_hres_lock & ~1 == new_hres_lock, as illustrated by the
 * following table of all possible lock states:
 *
 *	initial	& ~1	final		result of compare
 *	------------	-----		-----------------
 *	now:00		now:00		valid
 *	now:00		now:ff		invalid
 *	now:00		later:00	invalid
 *	now:00		later:ff	invalid
 *	now:fe		now:ff		invalid
 *	now:fe		later:00	invalid
 *	now:fe		later:ff	invalid
 *
 * Implementation considerations:
 *
 * (1) Load buffering.
 *
 * On a CPU that does load buffering we must ensure that the load of
 * hres_lock completes before the load of any timestamp components.
 * This is essential *even on a CPU that does in-order loads* because
 * accessing the hardware time source may not involve a memory reference
 * (e.g. rd %tick).  A convenient way to address this is to clear the
 * lower bit (andn with 1) of the old lock value right away, since this
 * generates a dependency on the load of hrt->hres_lock.  We have to do this
 * anyway to perform the lock comparison described above.
 *
 * (2) Out-of-order loads.
 *
 * On a CPU that does out-of-order loads we must ensure that the loads
 * of all timestamp components have completed before we load the final
 * value of hrt->hres_lock.  This can be done either by generating load
 * dependencies on the timestamp components or by membar #LoadLoad.
 *
 * (3) Interaction with the high level cyclic handler, hres_tick().
 *
 * One unusual property of hrt->hres_lock is that it's acquired in a high
 * level cyclic handler, hres_tick().  Thus, hrt->hres_lock must be acquired
 * at CBE_HIGH_PIL or higher to prevent single-CPU deadlock.
 *
 * (4) Cross-calls.
 *
 * If a cross-call happens while one CPU has hrt->hres_lock and another is
 * trying to acquire it in the clock interrupt path, the system will
 * deadlock: the first CPU will never release hrt->hres_lock since it's
 * waiting to be released from the cross-call, and the cross-call can't
 * complete because the second CPU is spinning on hrt->hres_lock with traps
 * disabled.  Thus cross-calls must be blocked while holding hrt->hres_lock.
 *
 * Together, (3) and (4) imply that hrt->hres_lock should only be acquired
 * at PIL >= max(XCALL_PIL, CBE_HIGH_PIL), or while traps are disabled.

/*
 * Convert hi-res native time (V9's %tick in our case) into nanoseconds.
 *
 * The challenge is to multiply a %tick value by (NANOSEC / sys_tick_freq)
 * without using floating point and without overflowing 64-bit integers.
 * We assume that all sun4u systems will have a 16 nsec or better clock
 * (i.e. faster than 62.5 MHz), which means that (ticks << 4) has units
 * greater than one nanosecond, so converting from (ticks << 4) to nsec
 * requires multiplication by a rational number, R, between 0 and 1.
 * To avoid floating-point we precompute (R * 2^32) during boot and
 * stash this away in nsec_scale.  Thus we can compute (tick * R) as
 * (tick * nsec_scale) >> 32, which is accurate to about 1 part per billion.
 *
 * To avoid 64-bit overflow when multiplying (tick << 4) by nsec_scale,
 * we split (tick << 4) into its high and low 32-bit pieces, H and L,
 * multiply each piece separately, and add up the relevant bits of the
 * partial products.  Putting it all together we have:
 *
 * nsec = (tick << 4) * R
 *	= ((tick << 4) * nsec_scale) >> 32
 *	= ((H << 32) + L) * nsec_scale) >> 32
 *	= (H * nsec_scale) + ((L * nsec_scale) >> 32)
 *
 * The last line is the computation we actually perform: it requires no
 * floating point and all intermediate results fit in 64-bit registers.
 *
 * Note that we require that tick is less than (1 << (64 - NSEC_SHIFT));
 * greater values will result in overflow and misbehavior (not that this
 * is a serious problem; (1 << (64 - NSEC_SHIFT)) nanoseconds is over
 * thirty-six years).  Nonetheless, clients may wish to be aware of this
 * limitation; NATIVE_TIME_MAX() returns this maximum native time.
 *
 * We provide two versions of this macro: a "full-service" version that
 * just converts ticks to nanoseconds and a higher-performance version that
 * expects the scaling factor nsec_scale as its second argument (so that
 * callers can distance the load of nsec_scale from its use).  Note that
 * we take a fast path if we determine the ticks to be less than 32 bits
 * (as it often is for the delta between %tick values for successive
 * firings of the hres_tick() cyclic).
 *
 * Note that in the 32-bit path we don't even bother clearing NPT.
 * We get away with this by making hardclk.c ensure than nsec_scale
 * is even, so we can take advantage of the associativity of modular
 * arithmetic: multiplying %tick by any even number, say 2*n, is
 * equivalent to multiplying %tick by 2, then by n.  Multiplication
 * by 2 is equivalent to shifting left by one, which clears NPT.
 *
 * Finally, note that the macros use the labels "6:" and "7:"; these
 * labels must not be used across an invocation of either macro.
