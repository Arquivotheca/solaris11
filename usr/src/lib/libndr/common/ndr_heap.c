/*
 * NDR heap management. The heap is used for temporary storage by
 * both the client and server side library routines.  In order to
 * support the different requirements of the various RPCs, the heap
 * can grow dynamically if required.  We start with a single block
 * and perform sub-allocations from it.  If an RPC requires more space
 * we will continue to add it a block at a time.  This means that we
 * don't hog lots of memory on every call to support the few times
 * that we actually need a lot heap space.
 *
 * Note that there is no individual free function.  Once space has been
 * allocated, it remains allocated until the heap is destroyed.  This
 * shouldn't be an issue because the heap is being filled with data to
 * be marshalled or unmarshalled and we need it all to be there until
 * the point that the entire heap is no longer required.
