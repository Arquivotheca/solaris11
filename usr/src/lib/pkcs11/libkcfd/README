This is a filter library that's used exclusively by kcfd;
it's 32-bit-only because kcfd is 32-bit-only.

libkcfd forces interposition of pkcs11_softtoken.so.1 into libkmf
when used by kcfd as part of the Cryptographic Framework's FIPS-140
project, to ensure that only pkcs11_softtoken.so.1 is used for
validation of the FIPS-140 boundary.

libelfsign could not be the interposer, because it would prevent
the elfsign(1) command from accessing actual PKCS#11 tokens when using
the -T option.
