/*
 * This functions supplements the gsscred table.
 *
 * First, it provides the mapping for root principal
 * entries.  The uid mapping returned is that of 0.
 * The name must be of the form root/... or root@...
 * or host/... (no host@... mapped to 0 cuz host could
 * be the name of a normal user)
 * or in Kerberos terms, the first component must be root or host.
 *
 * Second, it provides the mapping for normal user principals
 * using the passwd tbl.  Thus, the gsscred table is not normally
 * needed for the krb5 mech (though libgss will use it if this
 * routine fails).
 *
 * GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned on success.
 * GSS_S_FAILURE is returned on failure.
