<body>
When Administer VRRP is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants
authorization to administrate the VRRP service, which is provided by the
vrrpd(1M) daemon.  In particularly, the user is allowed to create, delete,
modify, disable, re-enable VRRP routers using the vrrpadm(1M) command.
<p>
Note, querying configuration and state information of a VRRP router using
vrrpadm(1M) doesn't require the Administer VRRP authorization.
