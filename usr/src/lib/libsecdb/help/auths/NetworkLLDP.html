<body>
When Administer LLDP is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants
authorization to administrate the LLDP service, which is provided by the
lldpd(1M) daemon.  In particularly, the user is allowed to start/stop the LLDP
agent, define the TLVs to be advertised, configure the TLVs being advertised,
using the lldpadm(1M) command.
<p>
Note, querying configuration and local/remote information of a LLDP agent using
lldpadm(1M) doesn't require the Administer LLDP authorization.
