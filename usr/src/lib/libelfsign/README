Note that this library does not have a spec file.

There are no interfaces in this library that are public so an abi_
library for appcert and friends doesn't make any sense.  If the APIs
here are ever elevated to a public taxonomy then a spec file needs to
be introduced.

A 64 bit version of this library does not exist.
That isn't an issue since kcfd(1m) and elfsign(1) are 32 bit
applications and are the only consumers.
