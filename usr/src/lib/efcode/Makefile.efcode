# Common build rules for efcode shared objects.

# For historical reasons, these shared objects aren't explicitly versioned, so
# turn off VERS and LIBLINKS (VERS must be cleared before the inclusion of
# Makefile.lib, and LIBLINKS must be cleared afterwards).  Also, because of
# the weird alternate naming scheme, we must define our own symlink macros.
