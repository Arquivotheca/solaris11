 *
 * These controls may only be applied to a subscription handle

 * If you require different properties per subscription then use multiple

 * in a serialized fashion on a single thread dedicated to the subscription.
 * If multiple subscriptions are established then each has a dedicated
 * delivery thread - fmev_shdlctl_serialize arranges that only one of these
 * threads services a callback at any one time.
 *
 * fmev_shdlctl_thrattr() allows you to provide thread attributes for use
 * in pthread_create() when server threads are created.  The attributes
 * are not copied - the pthread_attr_t object passed must exist for

 * after pthread_create.  This mask only applies if fmev_shdlctl_thrcreate()
 * is not in use on this handle.

 * Event access.  In the common case that the event is processed to

 * use fmev_attr_list to access the nvlist of event attributes,
 * with no responsibility for freeing the event or the nvlist; for
 * convenience, fmev_class and fmev_timestamp can both be used to
 * look inside an event without having to work with the attribute list (and
 * the callback receives the class as an argument).
 *
 * See libnvpair(3LIB) for interfaces to access an nvlist_t.
 *
 * The remaining interfaces apply in the case that event handling will
 * continue beyond the context of the event callback in which it is received.
 *
 * The fmev_t handle received in a callback is reference-counted;
 * the initial reference count on entry to the callback is 1, and the
 * count is always decremented when the callback completes.  To continue
 * to operate on a received event outside of the context of the callback
 * in which it is first received, take an fmev_hold during the callback
 * and later fmev_rele to release your hold (and free the event if the count
 * drops to 0).
 *
 * To access attributes of an event use fmev_attr_list to receive
 * an nvlist_t pointer valid for the same lifetime as the event itself (i.e.,
 * until its reference count drops to zero).
 *
 * If changes are made to a received fmev_t (discouraged) then all who
 * have a hold on the event share the change.  To obtain an independent
 * copy of an fmev_t, with a reference count of 1, use fmev_dup.  When
 * finished with the copy decrement the reference count
 * using fmev_rele - the event will be freed if the count reaches 0.
 *
 * For convenience you can retrieve the class of an event using fmev_class
 * (it's also available as an argument to a callback, and within the
 * event attribute list).  The string returned by fmev_class is valid for
 * the same lifetime as the event itself.
 *
 * The time at which a protocol event was generated is available via
 * fmev_timespec; tv_sec has seconds since the epoch, and tv_nsec nanoseconds
 * past that second.  This can fail with FMEVERR_OVERFLOW if the seconds
 * value does not fit within a time_t;  you can retrieve the 64-bit second
 * and nanosecond values with fmev_time_sec and fmev_time_nsec.
 *
 * An FMRI in an event payload is typically in nvlist form, i.e
 * DATA_TYPE_NVLIST.  That form is useful for extracting individual
 * component fields, but that requires knowledge of the FMRI scheme and
 * Public commitment thereof.  FMRIs are typically Private, but in some
 * cases they can be descriptive such as in listing the ASRU(s) affected
 * by a fault; so we offer an API member which will blindly render any
 * FMRI in its string form.  Use fmev_shdl_nvl2str to format an nvlist_t
 * as a string (if it is recognized as an FMRI); the caller is responsible
 * for freeing the returned string using fmev_shdl_strfree.  If
 * fmev_shdl_nvl2str fails it will return NULL with fmev_errno set -
 * FMEVERR_INVALIDARG if the nvlist_t does not appear to be a valid/known FMRI,
 * FMEVERR_ALLOC if an allocation for memory for the string failed.
 *
 * fmev_ev2shdl will return the fmev_shdl_t with which a received fmev_t
 * is associated.  It should only be used in an event delivery callback
 * context and for the event received in that callback.

/*
 * Part B - Raw Event Publication
 * ======
 *
 * The following interfaces are private to the Solaris system and are
 * subject to change at any time without notice.  Applications using
 * these interfaces will fail to run on future releases.  The interfaces
 * should not be used for any purpose until they are publicly documented
 * for use outside of Sun.  These interface are *certain* to change
 * incompatibly, as the current interface is very much purpose-built for
 * a limited application.
 *
 * The interfaces below allow a process to publish a "raw" event
 * which will be transmitted to the fault manager and post-processed
 * into a full FMA protocol event.  The post-processing to be applied
 * is selected by a "ruleset" specified either implicitly or explicitly
 * at publication.  A ruleset will take the raw event (comprising
 * class, subclass, priority, raw payload) and mark it up into a full
 * protocol event; it may also augment the payload through looking up
 * details that would have been costly to compute at publication time.
 *
 * In this first implementation event dispatch is synchronous and blocking,
 * and not guaranteed to be re-entrant.  This limits the call sites
 * at which publication calls can be placed, and also means that careful
 * thought is required before sprinkling event publication code throughout
 * common system libraries.  The dispatch mechanism amounts to some
 * nvlist chicanery followed by a sysevent_evc_publish.  A future revision
 * will relax the context from which one may publish, and add more-powerful
 * publication interfaces.
 *
 * Some publication interfaces (those ending in _nvl) accept a preconstructed
 * nvlist as raw event payload.  We require that such an nvlist be of type
 * NV_UNIQUE_NAME.  The publication interfaces all call nvlist_free on any
 * nvlist that is passed for publication.
 *
 * Other publication interfaces allow you to build up the raw event payload
 * by specifying the members in a varargs list terminated by FMEV_ARG_TERM.
 * Again we require that payload member names are unique (that is, you cannot
 * have two members with the same name but different datatype).  See
 * <sys/nvpair.h> for the data_type_t enumeration of types supported - but
 * note that DATA_TYPE_BOOLEAN is excluded (DATA_TYPE_BOOLEAN_VALUE is
 * supported).  A single-valued (non-array type) member is specified with 3
 * consecutive varargs as:
 *
 *	(char *)name, DATA_TYPE_foo, (type)value
 *
 * An array-valued member is specified with 4 consecutive varargs as:
 *
 *	(char *)name, DATA_TYPE_foo_ARRAY, (int)nelem, (type *)arrayptr
 *
 * The varargs list that specifies the nvlist must begin with an
 * integer that specifies the number of members that follow.  For example:
 *
 * uint32_t mode;
 * char *clientname;
 * uint32_t ins[NARGS];
 *
 * fmev_publish("class", "subclass", FMEV_LOPRI,
 *	3,
 *	"mode", DATA_TYPE_UINT32, mode,
 *	"client", DATA_TYPE_STRING, clientname,
 *	"ins", DATA_TYPE_UINT32_ARRAY, sizeof (ins) / sizeof (ins[0]), ins,
 *	FMEV_ARG_TERM);
 *
 * The following tables summarize the capabilities of the various
 * publication interfaces.
