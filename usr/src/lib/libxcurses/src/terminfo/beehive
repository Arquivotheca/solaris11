# beehive: BEEHIVE
#
# Reports are that most of these Beehive entries (except superbee) have not been
# tested and do not work right.  rmso is a trouble spot.  Be warned.
# set tab is ^F, clear (one) tab is ^V, no way to clear all tabs.
# Superbee - f1=escape, f2=^C.
# Note: there are at least 3 kinds of superbees in the world.  The sb1
# holds onto escapes and botches ^C's.  The sb2 is the best of the 3.
# The sb3 puts garbage on the bottom of the screen when you scroll with
# the switch in the back set to CRLF instead of AEP.  This description
# is tested on the sb2 but should work on all with either switch setting.
# The f1/f2 business is for the sb1 and the xsb can be taken out for
# the other two if you want to try to hit that tiny escape key.
# This description is tricky: being able to use cup depends on there being
# 2048 bytes of memory and the hairy ind string.
# Now that we have separate ind and cud1, I imagine this could be improved.
