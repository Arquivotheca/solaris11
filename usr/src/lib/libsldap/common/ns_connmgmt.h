 * and close them when all users are done using them. When a config change
 * notice is received, it will detach itself and allow a new ns_conn_mgmt be
 * created for the new configuration. The old config would still be used
 * by the detached ns_conn_mgmt. Both will be destroyed when all existing
 * conn_user are done. Any conn_user and MT connection created after the
 * configuration switch will use the new configuration.

 * the ns_conn_mgmt adds 1 to the count, any release of the ns_conn_mgmt
 * decrement the count by 1. The ns_conn_mgmt can not be freed until
 * the reference count becomes zero.
 *
 * Each ns_conn_mgmt references a native LDAP configuration. The config
 * component of this library always maintains a global configuration. It is

 * one, which is referred as the per connection management config. When

/*
 * For a connection management and the conn_mt connections it manages, it is
 * very helpful to know exactly when the Native LDAP configuration changes
 * and when the status of the configured servers change. If the config
 * changes, new connection management will be created. If servers go up
 * or down, conn_mt connections being used need to be dropped or switched.
 * For processes other than the main nscd, the changes has to be detected
 * in a less efficient way by libsldap. For the main nscd (not including
 * peruser nscd), the connection management which has active conn_mt
 * connections can rely on the ldap_cachemgr daemon to report if there's any
 * change in servers' status or if the native LDAP configuration has changed.
 *
 * The mechanism for reporting of the changes is a door call sent from
 * libsldap to ldap_cachemgr. The call will not be returned until changes
 * detected by ldap_cachemgr. When the change info is passed back to
 * libsldap, the change monitor thread will wake up from the door call
 * and process the notification. For servers went from up to down, the
 * associated MT connections will be closed, and then all conn_users'
 * state will be marked as closing. When a conn_user notices it, the
 * operations represented by that conn_user will be ended with error
 * info. When a more preferred server is up, MT connections using
 * less preferred servers will be marked as closed-when-all-user-done,
 * so that new connection will be opened and using the preferred server.
 * A configuration change causes the current connection management and
 * the configuration it uses to become detached but continually being
 * used by the old MT connections. Any new MT connection opened will
 * be put in a new connection management and uses the new configuration
 * immediately.
