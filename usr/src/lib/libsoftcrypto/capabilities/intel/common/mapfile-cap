# The only file that contains capabilities symbols is bignum_i386_asm.o,
# however this is a dependency of bignum_i386.o, which in turn is a dependency
# of pics/bignumimpl.o.  Only the last object exports any interfaces, hence
# we compile, and combine all three.  The resulting object is identified as a
# whole with the bignum_i386_asm.o capabilities flags.
#
# Note, the Studio assembler identifies bignum_i386_asm.o with its capability
# requirements - SSE2 and MMX.  Gnu's assembler does not.  These capability
# flags are defined here to ensure either assembler can be used, and a valid
# capabilities object is built for translating to a symbol capabilities object.
