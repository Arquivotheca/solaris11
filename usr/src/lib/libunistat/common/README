The error resource files in *.err of the subdirectories must only contain
embedded "%s" format descriptors for info to be edited into messages returned
from ioctls. Special "bytestream" data to be passed with status
(implementation TBD) is signified by "@@@" as the last three characters of
the  message text. Don't try to use this to pass a bytestream back via an
ioctl: it will just trigger an error.

After early development when the first creation of foreign language locale 
files by the company for a product takes place you are NOT free to make edits
to existing messages or their status code labels nor do any insertions. You
may ONLY ONLY ONLY append new lines to the end of the file.
