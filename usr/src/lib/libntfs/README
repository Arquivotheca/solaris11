This is the Solaris ON port of ntfsprogs v2.0.0
Please see http://www.linux-ntfs.org/ for more information.

ntfsprogs has been broken into two pieces: src/lib/libntfs and src/cmd/ntfsprogs

The Makefiles have all been replaced by ON Makefiles.

The common directory contains these subdirectories from ntfsprogs-2.0.0:
include and libntfs

$(SUBDIR)/config.status:	$(SUBDIR)/configure
	cd src; \
	MAKE=gmake ./configure CFLAGS=-I$(ROOT)/usr/include \
	LDFLAGS="-L$(ROOT)/lib -L$(ROOT)/usr/lib -Wl,-Bdirect -Wl,-M$(MAPFILE.NE
S) -Wl,-zignore" \
	--disable-dependency-tracking
