      filesystem if they are not present on the read write one. Data are
      written to the read-write filesystem. it's the same principle as the
      unionfs driver used in the well known Knoppix CDROM.

***** MythTVfs *****
Author: Kees Cook ( kees@outflux.net )
Homepage:
http://outflux.net/software/pkgs/mythtvfs-fuse/
  Description
      Designed to communicate with a MythTV backend server. It creates an
      overlay filesystem that encodes TV Program metadata (title, episode,
      description) into a filename so that systems that do not natively talk to
      MythTV can still get information about a given show. The initial design
      goal is to make it compatible with the in-filename metadata extraction
      capabilities that will (hopefully) be in future versions of
      Galleon
      .

      A user-space filesystem for the 20GB Rio Karma personal digital audio
      player, based on libkarma and FUSE. It provides most usual filesystem
      calls, including support for multiple, concurrent READ/WRITE. File
      properties such as size, permissions, creation and access times, are
      shown as regular file attributes. For all the other properties (codec,
      bit rate, times played, etc.), extended attributes are used. Therefore,
      full access to all the file data and metadata is granted using standart
      GNU-Linux tools.

 (not yet finished), download at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsfipi
  Description
      fsfipi: A framework supporting a cascade of filters, which modify the
      behaviour of a filesystem. Each filter uses the same interface for the
      higher level (i. e. the requests, what operations this filesystem shall
      do) and for the lower level interface (performing the file operations).
      Only the lowest level filter uses actual system calls to store files on
      the real file system (localfs) or there is a possibility of making sshfs-
      like lowest level filter. The only highest level filter now is
      fuse_interface, which implements a fuse filesystem daemon and sends the
      requests to the lower level filter.
      vaves: a filter for this framework, implementing a very configurable
      versioning file system.

  Description
      a simple way of managing a vast amount of data over multiple CD-R media
      by simulating all files on the CDs as if they were online on the
      harddisk. When a file is accessed, a dialog box asks for the correct CD.
      So any program can be used to acces the data without needing to know the
      files are on CD. Scripts are included for migrating data to CD (which was
      the more difficult work). Note that this project has not been updated
      since 3 years.

***** Cromfs *****
Author:
Joel_Yliluoma
Homepage:
http://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/cromfs.html
  Description
      Cromfs is a compressed read-only filesystem, similar to Cramfs and
      Squashfs. It uses the
      lzma
       compression algorithm.
      It splits each file into fixed-size blocks and compresses the blocks
      together in larger clusters, so that blocks from different files are
      compressed together for smaller size. Directories, inodes and block lists
      are also compressed. In some cases, it beats Squashfs by a factor of four
      in terms of compression power. On the flip side, it is noticeably slower
      than its peers, and requires more RAM.
