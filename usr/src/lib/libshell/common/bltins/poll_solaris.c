"[+NAME? poll - input/output multiplexing]"
"[+DESCRIPTION?The poll command provides applications with a mechanism "
	"for multiplexing input/output over a set of file descriptors. "
	"For each member of the array variable \bvar\b, "
	"poll examines the given file descriptor in the subscript \b.fd\b "
	"for the event(s) specified in the subscript \b.events\b."
	"The poll command identifies those file descriptors on which an "
	"application can read or write data, or on which certain events have "
	"occurred.]"
"[+?The \bvar\b argument specifies the file descriptors to be examined "
	"and the events of interest for each file descriptor. "
	"It is a array of structured variables with one member for each open "
	"file descriptor of interest. The array's members contain the following "
	"subscripts:]{"
		"[+?\b.fd\b       # file descriptor]"
		"[+?\b.events\b   # requested events]"
		"[+?\b.revents\b  # returned event]"
	"}"
"[+?The \bfd\b variable specifies an open file descriptor and the "
	"\bevents\b and \brevents\b members are strings constructed from "
	"a concatenation of the following event flags, separated by '|':]"
	"{ "
	"[+POLLIN?Data other than high priority data may be "
		"read without blocking. For STREAMS, this "
		"flag is set in revents even if the message "
		"is of zero length.]"
	"[+POLLRDNORM?Normal data (priority band equals 0) may be "
		"read without blocking. For STREAMS, this "
		"flag is set in revents even if the message "
		"is of zero length.]"
	"[+POLLRDBAND?Data from a non-zero priority band may be "
		"read without blocking. For STREAMS, this "
		"flag is set in revents even if the message "
		"is of zero length.]"
	"[+POLLPRI?High priority data may be received without "
		"blocking. For STREAMS, this flag is set in "
		"revents even if the message is of zero "
		"length.]"
	"[+POLLOUT?Normal data (priority band equals 0) may be "
		"written without blocking.]"
	"[+POLLWRNORM?The same as POLLOUT.]"
	"[+POLLWRBAND?Priority data (priority band > 0) may be "
		"written.  This event only examines bands "
		"that have been written to at least once.]"
	"[+POLLERR?An error has occurred on the device or "
		"stream.  This flag is only valid in the "
		"revents bitmask; it is not used in the "
		"events member.]"
	"[+POLLHUP?A hangup has occurred on the stream. This "
		"event and POLLOUT are mutually exclusive; a "
		"stream can never be writable if a hangup has "
		"occurred. However, this event and POLLIN, "
		", POLLRDBAND, or POLLPRI are not "
		"mutually exclusive. This flag is only valid "
		"in the revents bitmask; it is not used in "
		"the events member.]"
	"[+POLLNVAL?The specified fd value does not belong to an "
		"open file. This flag is only valid in the "
		"revents member; it is not used in the events "
		"member.]"
   "}"
"]"

"[+?If the value fd is less than 0, events is ignored and "
	"revents is set to 0 in that entry on return from poll.]"

"[+?The results of the poll query are stored in the revents "
	"member in the \bvar\b structure. POLL*-strings are set in the \brevents\b "
	"variable to indicate which of the requested events are true. "
	"If none are true, the \brevents\b will be an empty string when "
	"the poll command returns. The event flags "
	"POLLHUP, POLLERR, and POLLNVAL are always set in \brevents\b "
	"if the conditions they indicate are true; this occurs even "
	"though these flags were not present in events.]"

"[+?If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected "
	"file descriptor, poll waits at least timeout milliseconds "
	"for an event to occur on any of the selected file descriptors. "
	"On a computer where millisecond timing accuracy is not "
	"available, timeout is rounded up to the nearest legal value "
	"available on that system. If the value timeout is 0, poll "
	"returns immediately. If the value of timeout is -1, poll "
	"blocks until a requested event occurs or until the call is "
	"interrupted.]"

"[+?The poll function supports regular files, terminal and "
	"pseudo-terminal devices, STREAMS-based files, FIFOs and "
	"pipes. The behavior of poll on elements of fds that refer "
	"to other types of file is unspecified.]"

"[+?The poll function supports sockets.]"

"[+?A file descriptor for a socket that is listening for connections "
	"will indicate that it is ready for reading, once connections "
	"are available. A file descriptor for a socket that "
	"is connecting asynchronously will indicate that it is ready "
	"for writing, once a connection has been established.]"
 
"[+?Regular files always poll TRUE for reading and writing.]"

"[e:eventarray]:[fdcount?Upon successful completion, an indexed array "
	"of strings is returned which contains a list of array subscripts "
	"in the poll array which received events.]"
"[t:timeout]:[seconds?Timeout in seconds. If the value timeout is 0, "
	"poll returns immediately. If the value of timeout is -1, poll "
	"blocks until a requested event occurs or until the call is "
	"interrupted.]"
"[T:mtimeout]:[milliseconds?Timeout in milliseconds. If the value timeout is 0, "
	"poll returns immediately. If the value of timeout is -1, poll "
