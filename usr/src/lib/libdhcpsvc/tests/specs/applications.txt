		Enterprise: Application Layer Test Specification
		================================================

ABSTRACT

	This document describes a series of test specifications intended
to be used in the development of test suite(s) to validate the
application/service layer functionality described in Section 2.0 of the
Enterprise DHCP Service Architecture Specification (ARCH) [1]. There is
one test specification for each of the following application/service
layer components:

	* in.dhcpd	-	DHCP Service daemon

	* dhcpmgr	-	DHCP Manager GUI

	* dhcpconfig	-	CLI DHCP service bootstrap program

	* dhtadm	-	CLI dhcptab table management utility

	* pntadm	-	CLI dhcp network table(s) management
				utility

TEST APPLICATION

	Test suites(s) written to these specifications should be run
on the reference platform of each of the supported architectures
(sparcv8, sparcv9, IA32, IA64) for each build of the ON consolidation.
See "Enterprise Reference platforms" [1].
