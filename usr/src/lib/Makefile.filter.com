# Makefile.filter.com and Makefile.filter.targ provide centralized Makefiles
# for driving the creation of standard shared object filters.  This class of
# filter contains absolutely no implementation (code), instead associating all
# symbol definitions to an alternative shared object (filtee).
#
# Standard filters are commonly used to preserve previously documented system
# interfaces when moving symbol definitions from one library to another.  They
# are analogous to the way symbolic links are used in the system to preserve
# well known file names.  For example, the Unified Process Model folded threads
# processing into libc.so.1, and left standard filters /lib/lib[p]thread.so.1
# in place.  These filters are built under usr/src/lib/lib[p]thread, and serve
# as typical examples.
#
# A typical Makefile.com for building a standard filter library contains:
#
#   % cat Makefile.com
#   ...
#   LIBRARY =	   libxxxx.a
#   VERS =	   .1
#
#   include	   $(SRC)/lib/Makefile.rootfs		(1)
#
#   LIBS +=	   $(LINTLIB)				(2)
#   DYNFLAGS +=	   -F filtee				(3)
#   MAPFILEDIR =   .					(4)
#
# 1.  Use Makefile.rootfs when destination is /lib (rather than /usr/lib).
# 2.  Add LINTLIB when a lint library is produced.
# 3.  Customize DYNFLAGS to indicate filtee name.
# 4.  Change MAPFILEDIR if mapfiles are not under ../common.
#
# The typical use of Makefile.filter.com and Makefile.filter.targ is through
# inclusion from a standard filters machine specific Makefiles:
#
#   % cat $(MACH)/Makefile
#   ...
#   include	   $(SRC)/lib/Makefile.filter.com
#   include	   ../Makefile.com
#   include	   (SRC)/lib/Makefile.lib.64		(1)
#
#   DYNFLAGS +=	   -h libyyyyy.so.1			(2)
#
#   install	   all $(ROOT......
#
#   include	   $(SRC)/lib/Makefile.filter.targ
#
# 1.  Use Makefile.lib.64 for 64-bit builds.
# 2.  Customize DYNFLAGS for $MACH if necessary.  
#

include	   	$(SRC)/lib/Makefile.lib

# Define common flags, that override or append to Makefile.lib rules.
