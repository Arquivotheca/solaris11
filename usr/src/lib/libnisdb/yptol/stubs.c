/*
 * DESCRIPTION:	The N2L system is dependent on a number of utility functions
 *		supplied by NIS object code (under cmd/ypcmd). When libnisdb
 *		is loaded by executable other than those built under
 *		cmd/ypcmd these would be undefined. To prevent this happening
 *		the stubs in this file contain weak definitions on these
 *		functions. In the NIS case these weak definitions will be
 *		overridden by the real ones.
 *
 *		The functions in this file will never be called. NIS will have
 *		overridden them and nothing else should call yptol. If they are
 *		called then there is a bug in the build system.
 *
 *		Note : This is not elegant but it is a way of dealing with
 *		preexisting code structure.
