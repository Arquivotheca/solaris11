 * DESCRIPTION: Contains the top level shim hook functions. These must have
 *		identical interfaces to the equivalent standard dbm calls.
 *
 *		Unfortunately many of these will do a copy of a datum structure
 *		on return. This is a side effect of the original DBM function
 *		being written to pass structures rather than pointers.
 *
 * NOTE :	There is a major bug/feature in dbm. A key obtained by
 *		dbm_nextkey() of dbm_firstkey() cannot be passed to dbm_store().
 *		When the store occurs dbm's internal memory get's reorganized
 *		and the static strings pointed to by the key are destroyed. The
 *		data is then stored in the wrong place. We attempt to get round
 *		this by dbm_firstkey() and dbm_nextkey() making a copy of the
 *		key data in malloced memory. This is freed when map_ctrl is
 *		freed.
