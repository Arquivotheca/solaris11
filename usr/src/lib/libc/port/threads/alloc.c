 * This is a small and simple power of two memory allocator that is
 * used internally by libc.  Allocations are fast and memory is never
 * returned to the system, except for allocations of 64 Kbytes and larger,
 * which are simply mmap()ed and munmap()ed as needed.  Smaller allocations
 * (minimum size is 64 bytes) are obtained from mmap() of 64K chunks
 * broken up into unit allocations and maintained on free lists.
 * The interface requires the caller to keep track of the size of an
 * allocated block and to pass that size back when freeing a block.
 *
 * This allocator is called during initialization, from code called
 * from the dynamic linker, so it must not call anything that might
 * re-invoke the dynamic linker to resolve a symbol.  That is,
 * it must only call functions that are wholly private to libc.
 *
 * Also, this allocator must be unique across all link maps
 * because pointers returned by lmalloc() are stored in the
 * thread structure, which is constant across all link maps.
 *
 * Memory blocks returned by lmalloc() are initialized to zero.

 * 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, giving them initial numbers of elements
 * 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1, respectively.  The remaining 12K is cut
 * into one 4K buffer for bucket 6 and one 8K buffer for bucket 7.
 *
 * This results in almost all simple single-threaded processes,
 * such as those employed in the kenbus test suite, having to
 * allocate only this one 24K block during their lifetimes.
