/*
 *	mktemp() expects a string with up to six trailing 'X's.
 *	These will be overlaid with letters, digits and symbols from
 *	the portable filename character set.  If every combination thus
 *	inserted leads to an existing file name, the string is shortened
 *	to length zero and a pointer to a null string is returned.
 *
 *	The guarantee made by mktime() to the caller is that the
 *	generated file name string will not match the string
 *	produced by any other concurrent process using mktemp().
 *	To guarantee uniqueness across the process-id space,
 *	the process-id of the caller is encoded into the string.
 *	To allow repeated calls within the same process to generate
 *	different strings on each call, a sequence number is encoded
 *	into the string along with process-id.
 *
 *	The encoding is performed using radix-64 (6 bits per character),
 *	with 64 characters taken from the portable file name character set.
 *	This allows the six X's to be a representation of a 36-bit integer
 *	composed of bit fields:
 *		( pid | seq )
 *	where the process-id occupies the high-order bits and the sequence
 *	number occupies the low-order bits.  The size of the pid field is
 *	not fixed at the traditional 15 bits (MAXPID = 30000); the system
 *	now allows a larger process-id space and MAXPID is obtained from
 *	the system with a call to sysconf(_SC_MAXPID).
 *
 *	mktime() should fail if fewer than six X's are presented to it.
 *	However, this has been traditionally accepted and is preserved
 *	in the present code.  The consequence is that the 36-bit integer
 *	is reduced to a (6*N)-bit integer, where N is the number of X's.
 *	mktime() fails immediately if the resulting integer is not large
 *	enough to contain MAXPID.
 *
 *	In an attempt to confuse and thwart hackers, the starting
 *	sequence number is randomized using the current time.
