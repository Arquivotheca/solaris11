# Kludge alert:  SHA1 is used to identify SPARC-T4 platforms. The T4 optimized
# memmove/memcpy routines in sun4v-hwcap3 do not use sha1 instructions.  Since
# the symbol capability platform names are not available for sun4v (CA_SUNW_PLAT
# is set to "sun4v" on all sun4v platforms), there is no clean mechanism to load
# processor specific capabilities. The SHA1 hwcap was arbitrarily chosen from the
# set of new SPARC-T4 hwcaps to identify SPARC-T4 platforms, since SHA1 is currently
# only set for  SPARC-T4 platforms.  Future derivative processor platforms that set
# SHA1 will also load the sun4v-hwcap3 optimized routines.  Until a proper mechanism
# is implemented, these future platforms will need to define a new sun4v-hwcap if they
# need to override the sun4v-hwcap3 routines.
