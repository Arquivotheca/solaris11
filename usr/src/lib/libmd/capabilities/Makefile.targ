# libmd provides two families of optimized functions for SPARC platforms,
# one for sun4u, and one for sun4v.  Previous implementations provided
# these families as libmd_psr.so.1 libraries, triggered by tagging libmd.so.1
# as an auxiliary filter.  These psr filtees were installed under
# /usr/platform/sun4u/lib, and numerous symlinks were established to provide
# the necessary $PLATFORM names, ie:
#
#  /usr/platform/SUNW,Ultra-2/lib/libmd_psr.so.1 -> ../../../sun4u
#  /usr/platform/SUNW,Ultra-4/lib/libmd_psr.so.1 -> ../../../sun4u
#  ....
#
# and:
#
#  /usr/platform/SUNW,Netra-CP3060/lib/libmd_psr.so.1 -> ../../sun4v
#  /usr/platform/SUNW,Netra-CP3260/lib/libmd_psr.so.1 -> ../../sun4v/
#  ....
#
# The objects that made up these filtees are now combined into one relocatable
# object, pics/objcap.o, using ../common/mapfile-cap.  This mapfile identifies
# the machine hardware name, together with establishing the global symbols that
# should be exported to define each family.
#
# This object capabilities relocatable object is then translated into a symbol
# capabilities relocatable object, pics/symcap.o.
#
# The sun4u and sun4v families of symbol capabilities object are eventually
# included in the final build of libmd.so.1.
