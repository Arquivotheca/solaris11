/usr/lib/krb5/libdb2.so.1 is the DB package that is shipped with MIT
Kerberos 1.0.  It is *not* Berkeley DB 1.x or Sleepycat DB 2.x and is
incompatible with both.  Its use is intended solely for the Solaris
SEAM (Kerberos) components and it is not a public interface thus any
other use is *unsupported* and it may be removed from Solaris at any
time without warning.
