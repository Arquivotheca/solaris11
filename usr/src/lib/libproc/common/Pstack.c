/*
 * Signal frame and number detection.
 *
 * For the benefit of the various ISA-specific implementations of Pstack_iter()
 * we define a set of utility routines that operate on a uclist (ucontext
 * address list). These routines enable the detection and processing of signal
 * frames without any private knowledge of the userland signal implementation.
 * This allows us to examine programs that manipulate their underlying kernel
 * signal handlers (i.e. use __sigaction) and insulates us from possible future
 * library changes.
 *
 * A signal handler frame is essentially a set of data pushed on to the user
 * stack by the kernel prior to returning to the user program in one of the
 * pre-defined signal handlers.  The signal handler itself receives the signal
 * number, an optional pointer to a siginfo_t, and a pointer to the interrupted
 * ucontext as arguments.  When performing a stack backtrace, we would like to
 * detect these frames so that we can correctly return the interrupted program
 * counter and frame pointer as a separate frame.  When a signal handler frame
 * is constructed on the stack by the kernel, the signalled LWP has its
 * lwp_oldcontext member (exported through /proc as lwpstatus.pr_oldcontext)
 * set to the user address at which the ucontext_t was placed on the LWP's
 * stack.  The ucontext_t's uc_link member is set to the previous value of
 * lwp_oldcontext.  Thus when signal handlers are active, pr_oldcontext will
 * point to the first element of a linked list of ucontext_t addresses.
 *
 * The stack layout for a signal handler frame is as follows:
 *
 * SPARC v7/v9:
 * +--------------+ -        high
 * |  struct fq   | ^        addrs
 * +--------------+ |          ^
 * |  gwindows_t  |            |
 * +--------------+ optional
 * |  siginfo_t   |
 * +--------------+ |          |
 * |  xregs data  | v          v
 * +--------------+ -         low
 * |  ucontext_t  | ^        addrs
 * +--------------+ mandatory
 * | struct frame | v
 * +--------------+ - <- %sp on resume
 *
 * Intel ia32:
 * +--------------+ -
 * |  siginfo_t   | ^
 * +--------------+ optional
 * |  xregs data  | v
 * +--------------+ -
 * |  ucontext_t  | ^
 * +--------------+ |
 * | ucontext_t * | |
 * +--------------+
 * |  siginfo_t * | mandatory
 * +--------------+
 * |  int (signo) | |
 * +--------------+ |
 * | struct frame | v
 * +--------------+ - <- %esp on resume
 *
 * amd64 (64-bit):
 * +--------------+ -
 * |  siginfo_t   | ^
 * +--------------+ optional
 * |  xregs data  | v
 * +--------------+ -
 * |  ucontext_t  | ^
 * +--------------+ |
 * |  siginfo_t * |
 * +--------------+ mandatory
 * |  int (signo) |
 * +--------------+ |
 * | struct frame | v
 * +--------------+ - <- %rsp on resume
 *
 * The bottom-most struct frame is actually constructed by the kernel by
 * copying the previous stack frame, allowing naive backtrace code to simply
 * skip over the interrupted frame.  The copied frame is never really used,
 * since it is presumed the libc or libthread signal handler wrapper function
 * will explicitly setcontext(2) to the interrupted context if the user
 * program's handler returns.  If we detect a signal handler frame, we simply
 * read the interrupted context structure from the stack, use its embedded
 * gregs to construct the register set for the interrupted frame, and then
 * continue our backtrace.  Detecting the frame itself is easy according to
 * the diagram ("oldcontext" represents any element in the uc_link chain):
 *
 * On SPARC v7 or v9:
 * %fp + sizeof (struct frame) == oldcontext
 *
 * On Intel ia32:
 * %ebp + sizeof (struct frame) + (3 * regsize) == oldcontext
 *
 * On amd64:
 * %rbp + sizeof (struct frame) + (2 * regsize) == oldcontext
 *
 * A final complication is that we want libproc to support backtraces from
 * arbitrary addresses without the caller passing in an LWP id.  To do this,
 * we must first determine all the known oldcontexts by iterating over all
 * LWPs and following their pr_oldcontext pointers.  We optimize our search
 * by discarding NULL pointers and pointers whose value is less than that
 * of the initial stack pointer (since stacks grow down from high memory),
 * and then sort the resulting list by virtual address so we can binary search.
 *
 * On the x86 architectures the signal number is trivial to obtain since its
 * presence in the signal frame is mandated by the corresponding ABI.
 * Unfortunately, SPARC enjoys no such convenience: although we know that the
 * handler receives the signal number as its first argument, a compiler is
 * free to do as it pleases with the function's registers.  Not all is lost,
 * however. PSARC/1999/024 specifies (amongst other things) that the default
 * signal-handling implementation will include a call to __sighndlr(); this
 * function is written by hand so that the signal number, which it is passed as
 * its first argument, may be recovered reliably.
