 * Principles of emulation 101.
 *
 *
 * *** Setting errno
 *
 * Just don't do it.  This emulation library is loaded onto a
 * separate link map from the application whose address space we're
 * running in.  We have our own private copy of libc, so there for,
 * the errno value accessible from here is is also private and changing
 * it will not affect any errno value that the processes who's address
 * space we are running in will see.  To return an error condition we
 * should return the errno value we'd like the system to return.
 * For more information about this see the comments in brand_misc.h.
 * Basically, when we return to the caller that initiated the system
 * call it's their responsibility to set errno.
 *
 *
 * *** Recursion Considerations
 *
 * When emulating system calls we need to be very careful about what
 * library calls we invoke.  Library calls should be kept to a minimum.
 * One issue is that library calls can invoke system calls, so if we're
 * emulating a system call and we invoke a library call that depends on
 * that system call we will probably enter a recursive loop, which would
 * be bad.
 *
 *
 * *** Return Values.
 *
 * See brand_misc.h.
 *
 * *** Agent lwp considerations
 *
 * It is currently impossible to do any emulation for these system call
 * when they are being invoked on behalf of an agent lwp.  To understand why
 * it's impossible you have to understand how agent lwp syscalls work.
 *
 * The agent lwp syscall process works as follows:
 *   1  The controlling process stops the target.
 *   2  The controlling process injects an agent lwp which is also stopped.
 *      This agent lwp assumes the userland stack and register values
 *      of another stopped lwp in the current process.
 *   3  The controlling process configures the agent lwp to start
 *      executing the requested system call.
 *   4  The controlling process configure /proc to stop the agent lwp when
 *      it enters the requested system call.
 *   5  The controlling processes allows the agent lwp to start executing.
 *   6  The agent lwp traps into the kernel to perform the requested system
 *      call and immediately stop.
 *   7  The controlling process copies all the arguments for the requested
 *      system call onto the agent lwp's stack.
 *   8  The controlling process configures /proc to stop the agent lwp
 *      when it completes the requested system call.
 *   9  The controlling processes allows the agent lwp to start executing.
 *  10  The agent lwp executes the system call and then stop before returning
 *      to userland.
 *  11  The controlling process copies the return value and return arguments
 *      back from the agent lwps stack.
 *  12  The controlling process destroys the agent lwp and restarts
 *      the target process.
 *
 * The fundamental problem is that when the agent executes the request
 * system call in step 5, if we're emulating that system call then the
 * lwp is redirected back to our emulation layer without blocking
 * in the kernel.  But our emulation layer can't access the arguments
 * for the system call because they haven't been copied to the stack
 * yet and they still only exist in the controlling processes address
 * space.  This prevents us from being able to do any emulation of
 * agent lwp system calls.  Hence, currently our brand trap interposition
 * callback (XXX_brand_syscall_callback_common) will detect if a system
 * call is being made by an agent lwp, and if this is the case it will
 * never redirect the system call to this emulation library.
 *
 * In the future, if this proves to be a problem the the easiest solution
 * would probably be to replace the branded versions of these application
 * with their native counterparts.  Ie,  truss, plimit, and pfiles could be
 * replace with wrapper scripts that execute the native versions of these
 * applications.  In the case of plimit and pfiles this should be pretty
 * strait forward.  Truss would probably be more tricky since it can
 * execute applications which would be branded applications, so in that
 * case it might be necessary to create a loadable library which could
 * be LD_PRELOADed into truss and this library would interpose on the
 * exec() system call to allow truss to correctly execute branded
 * processes.  It should be pointed out that this solution could work
 * because "native agent lwps" (ie, agent lwps created by native
 * processes) can be treated differently from "branded aged lwps" (ie,
 * agent lwps created by branded processes), since native agent lwps
 * would presumably be making native system calls and hence not need
 * any interposition.
 *
 * *** General considerations
 *
 * One of the differences between the lx brand and the s10
 * brand, is that the s10 brand only interposes on syscalls
 * that need some kind of emulation, whereas the lx brand interposes
 * on _all_ system calls.  Lx branded system calls that don't need
 * any emulation are then redirected back to the kernel from the
 * userland library via the IN_KERNEL_SYSCALL macro.  The lx-syscall
 * dtrace provider depends on this behavior.
