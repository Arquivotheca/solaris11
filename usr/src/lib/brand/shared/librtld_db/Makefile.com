# ATTENTION:
#	Librtl_db brand plugin libraries should NOT directly invoke any

#	brand plugin library uses libproc.so interfaces then it may break

#	to a branded process.  The only safe interfaces that the a librtld_db
#	brand plugin library can use to access a target process are the
#	proc_service(3PROC) apis.
