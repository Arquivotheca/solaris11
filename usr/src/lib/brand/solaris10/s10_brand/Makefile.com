# Note that the architecture specific makefiles MUST update DYNFLAGS to
# explicitly specify an interpreter for the brand emulation library so that we
# use /lib/ld.so.1 or /lib/64/ld.so.1, which in a s10 zone is the Solaris 10
# linker.  This is different from some other brands where the linker that is
# used is the native system linker (/.SUNWnative/.../ld.so.1).  We have to do
# this because the linker has a very incestuous relationship with libc and we
# don't want to use the native linker with the s10 version of libc.  (This may
# come as a surprise to the reader, but when our library is loaded it get's
# linked against the s10 version of libc.)  Although the linker interfaces are
# normally stable, there are examples, such as with the solaris8 brand, where
# we could not combine the brand's libc with the native linker.  Since we want
# to run in a known configuration, we use the S10 libc/linker combination.
# 
# There is one more non-obvious side effect of using the s10 linker that
# should be mentioned.  Since the linker is used to setup processes before
# libc is loaded, it makes system calls directly (ie avoiding libc), and
# it makes these system calls before our library has been initialized.
# Since our library hasn't been initialized yet, there's no way for us
# to intercept and emulate any of those system calls.  So if any of those
# system calls ever change in the native code such that they break the s10
# linker then we're kinda screwed and will need to re-visit the current
# solution.  (The likely solution then will probably be to start using the
# native linker with our brand emulation library.)
#
# Note that we make sure to link our brand emulation library
# libmapmalloc.  This is required because in most cases there will be two
# copies of libc in the same process and we don't want them to fight over
# the heap.  So for our brand library we link against libmapmalloc so that
# if we (our or copy of libc) try to allocate any memory it will be done
# via mmap() instead of brk().
