# This script is invoked by isaexec-governed executable wrappers from within
# s10-branded zones.  It circumvents the native isaexec so that native wrappers
# will function correctly.
#
# All native executables must be run using the native linker.
# By default, the kernel loads the linker at /lib/ld.so.1, which
# in an s10 zone is the s10 linker.  Hence when we run the native
# executable below, we explicitly specify /.SUNWnative/lib/ld.so.1 as our 32-
# bit linker and /.SUNWnative/lib/64/ld.so.1 as our 64-bit linker.
# For convience we define "n" to be the native path prefix.
# The initial s10_native argument is used as a way to tell the brand
# emulation that it needs to set up the process to run as an unbranded
# process.
#
# If this script gets setup with a mode that makes it suid, then things won't
# work because the script will be running with the incorrect name.
