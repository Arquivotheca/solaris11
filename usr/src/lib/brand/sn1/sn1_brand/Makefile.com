# Note that the architecture specific makefiles MUST update DYNFLAGS to
# explicily specify an interpreter for the brand emulation library.
# Normally this would be the native linker, /.SUNWnative/usr/lib/ld.so.1
# or /.SUNWnative/usr/lib/64/ld.so.1.
#
# Note that we make sure to link our brand emulation library
# libmapmalloc.  This is required because in most cases there will be two
# copies of libc in the same process and we don't want them to fight over
# the heap.  So for our brand library we link against libmapmalloc so that
# if we (our or copy of libc) try to allocate any memory it will be done
# via mmap() instead of brk().
#
# XXX: Note that we also set the runtime path for the emulation library to
# point into /.SUNWnative/.  This ensures that our brand library get's the
# native versions of any libraries it needs.  Unfortunatly this is a total
# hack since it doesn't work for suid binaries.  What we really need to do
# is enhance the linker so that when it's running on a brand linkmap it
# looks for all libraries in the brands "native" directory (for both
# regular and suid binaries).
