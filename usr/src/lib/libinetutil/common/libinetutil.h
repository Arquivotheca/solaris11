 * Timer queues
 *
 * timer queues are a facility for managing timeouts in unix.  in the
 * event driven model, unix provides us with poll(2)/select(3C), which
 * allow us to coordinate waiting on multiple descriptors with an
 * optional timeout.  however, often (as is the case with the DHCP
 * agent), we want to manage multiple independent timeouts (say, one
 * for waiting for an OFFER to come back from a server in response to
 * a DISCOVER sent out on one interface, and another for waiting for
 * the T1 time on another interface).  timer queues allow us to do
 * this in the event-driven model.
 *
 * note that timer queues do not in and of themselves provide the
 * event driven model (for instance, there is no handle_events()
 * routine).  they merely provide the hooks to support multiple
 * independent timeouts.  this is done for both simplicity and
 * applicability (for instance, while one approach would be to use
 * this timer queue with poll(2), another one would be to use SIGALRM
 * to wake up periodically, and then process all the expired timers.)
