/*
 * Data structures and routines for printing output.
 *
 * All output is assumed to be in a columnar format, where each column
 * represents a field to be printed out. Multiple fields in parsable output
 * are separated by ':', with the ':' character itself escaped by a \
 * (e.g., IPv6 addresses  may be printed as "fe80\:\:1"); single field output
 * is printed as-is.
 * In multiline mode, every [field,value] pair is printed in a line of
 * its own, thus: "field: value".
 *
 * The caller must open a handle for each set of fields to be printed by
 * invoking ofmt_open(). The invocation to ofmt_open must provide the list of
 * supported fields, along with formatting information (e.g., field width), and
 * a pointer to a callback function that can provide a string representation of
 * the value to be printed out. The set of supported fields must be a NULL
 * terminated array of type ofmt_field_t *ofields[]. The contents of the
 * ofmt_field_t structure are used to construct the string that is emitted by
 * ofmt_print(), and the interpretation of these contents is described with the
 * semantics of ofmt_print() below.
 *
 * In addition, the call to ofmt_open() should provide a comma-separated
 * list of the fields, char *fields_str, that have been selected for output
 * (typically the string passed to -o in the command-line). The caller may
 * also specify machine-parsable mode by specifying OFMT_PARSABLE in the oflags
 * argument. Specifying a null or empty fields_str in the machine-parsable mode
 * will result in a returned error value of OFMT_EPARSENONE. An attempt to
 * create a handle in machine-parsable mode with the fields_str set to "all"
 * will result in a returned error value of OFMT_EPARSEALL. In human-friendly
 * (non machine-parsable) mode, a NULL fields_str, or a value of "all" for
 * fields_str, is treated as a request to print all allowable fields that fit
 * other applicable constraints.
 * To achieve multiline mode, OFMT_MULTILINE needs to be specified in oflags.
 * Specifying both OFMT_MULTILINE and OFMT_PARSABLE will result in
 * OFMT_EPARSEMULTI.
 *
 * Thus a typical invocation to open the ofmt_handle would be:
 *
 *	ofmt_handle_t ofmt;
 *	ofmt_status_t ofmt_err;
 *
 *	ofmt_err = ofmt_open(fields_str, ofields, oflags, maxcols, &ofmt);
 *
 * where ofields is an array of the form:
 *
 * static ofmt_field_t ofields[] = {
 *	{<name>, <field width>,  <id>, <callback> },
 *	:
 *	{<name>, <field width>,  <id>, <callback> },
 *	{NULL, 0, 0, NULL}}
 *
 * <callback> is the application-specified function that provides a string
 * representation of the value to be printed for the field. The calling
 * application may provide unique values of <id> that will be passed back to
 * <callback>, allowing a single <callback> to be shared between multiple
 * fields in ofields[] with the value of <id> identifying the field that
 * triggers the callback.
 *
 * If successful, ofmt_open() will return OFMT_SUCCESS, with a non-null
 * ofmt_handle. The function returns a failure code otherwise, and more
 * information about the type of failure can be obtained by calling
 * ofmt_strerror()
 *
 * In order to print a row of output, the calling application should invoke
 *
 *     ofmt_print(ofmt_handle, cbarg);
 *
 * where  'cbarg' points at the arguments to be  passed to the <callback>
 * function  for each column in the row. The call to ofmt_print() will then
 * result in the <callback> function of each selected field from ofields[]
 * invoked with cbarg embedded in the ofmt_arg as
 *
 *     (*callback)(ofmt_arg_t *ofmt_arg, char *buf, uint_t bufsize)
 *
 * Columns selected for output are identified by a match between the of_name
 * value in the ofmt_field_t and the fields_str requested. For each selected
 * column, the callback function (*of_cb)() is invoked, and is passed the of_id
 * value from the ofmt_field_t structure for the field.
 *
 * The interpretation of the of_id field is completely private to the caller,
 * and can be optionally used by the callback function as a cookie
 * to identify the field being printed when a single callback function is
 * shared between multiple ofmt_field_t entries.
 *
 * The callback function should fill `buf' with the string to be printed for
 * the field using the data in cbarg.
 *
 * The calling application should invoke ofmt_close(ofmt_handle) to free up any
 * resources allocated for the handle after all printing is completed.
 *
 * The printing library computes the current size of the output window when the
 * handle is first created. If the caller wishes to adjust the window size
 * after the handle has been created (e.g., on the reception of SIGWINCH by the
 * caller), the function ofmt_update_winsize(handle) may be called.
