 * Return the version number of the tecla library.
 *
 * Input:
 *  major    int *   The major version number of the library
 *                   will be assigned to *major. This number is
 *                   only incremented when a change to the library is
 *                   made that breaks binary (shared library) and/or
 *                   compilation backwards compatibility.
 *  minor    int *   The minor version number of the library
 *                   will be assigned to *minor. This number is
 *                   incremented whenever new functions are added to
 *                   the public API.
 *  micro    int *   The micro version number of the library will be
 *                   assigned to *micro. This number is incremented
 *                   whenever internal changes are made that don't
 *                   change the public API, such as bug fixes and
 *                   performance enhancements.
