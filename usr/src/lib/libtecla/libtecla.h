 *  [^chars] -  The same as [chars] except that it matches any single
 *              character that doesn't appear in 'chars'.
 *
 * Wildcard expressions are applied to individual filename components.
 * They don't match across directory separators. A '.' character at
 * the beginning of a filename component must also be matched
 * explicitly by a '.' character in the input pathname, since these
 * are UNIX's hidden files.
