 * dynopenpromio structs are similar to openpromio structs, but with 2 major
 * differences. The first is that the opio_u.b element is char * instead of
 * char [], which allows for dynamic sizing.
 *
 * The second regards opio_u.i, which was an int, but is now int []. In almost
 * all cases, only opio_u.i (opio_u.i[0]) will be referenced. However, certain
 * platforms rely on the fact that Prop structures formerly contained Oppbuf
 * unions, the buf element of which was statically sized at 4k. In theory, this
 * enabled those platforms to validly reference any part of the union up to 4k
 * from the start. In reality, no element greater than opio_u.i[4] is currently
 * referenced, hence OPROM_NODE_SIZE (named because opio_u.i is usually
 * referenced as oprom_node) being set to 5.
 *
 * A minor difference is that the holds_array element has been added, which
 * affords an easy way to determine whether opio_u contains char * or int.
