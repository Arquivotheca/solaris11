/*
 * napms.  Sleep for ms milliseconds.  We don't expect a particularly good
 * resolution - 60ths of a second is normal, 10ths might even be good enough,
 * but the rest of the program thinks in ms because the unit of resolution
 * varies from system to system.  (In some countries, it's 50ths, for example.)
 * Vaxen running 4.2BSD and 3B's use 100ths.
 *
 * Here are some reasonable ways to get a good nap.
 *
 * (1) Use the poll() or select() system calls in SVr3 or Berkeley 4.2BSD.
 *
 * (2) Use the 1/10th second resolution wait in the System V tty driver.
 *     It turns out this is hard to do - you need a tty line that is
 *     always unused that you have read permission on to sleep on.
 *
 * (3) Install the ft (fast timer) device in your kernel.
 *     This is a pseudo-device to which an ioctl will wait n ticks
 *     and then send you an alarm.
 *
 * (4) Install the nap system call in your kernel.
 *     This system call does a timeout for the requested number of ticks.
 *
 * (5) Write a routine that busy waits checking the time with ftime.
 *     Ftime is not present on SYSV systems, and since this busy waits,
 *     it will drag down response on your system.  But it works.
