.I wsdiff
\- report differences between proto area objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwsdiff [-dvVst] [-m \fImogdir\fP] [-r \fIresults\fP] [-i \fIfilelist\fP] \fIold\fP \fInew\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "wsdiff" "" "\fBwsdiff\fP"
.LP
The wsdiff utility detects and reports on object differences found between
two proto areas constructed from the same workspace. This can be useful
when trying to understand which objects have changed as a result of a particular
source change.
.LP
\fIold\fP specifies the baseline proto area constructed without the source
change. \fInew\fP specifies the proto area constructed with the source
change. Both \fIold\fP and \fInew\fP should be constructed from the same
workspace, otherwise wsdiff will find object differences not associated
with the source change.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B -d
Print debug information. The debug lines are prefixed with ##.
.TP 10
.B -m
Specify the directory that contains mogrified package manifests (typically
$SRC/pkg/packages.`uname -p`). This option enables the detection of files that
are not delivered by any package (assuming that the manifests are successfully
read). This option implies -s.
.TP 10
.B -v
Do not truncate the diffs logged to the results file. By default wsdiff
will truncate the length of a sufficiently long set of object diffs to preserve
the readability of the results file. -v can be used to override this behaviour.
.TP 10
.B -V
Log observed differences for all ELF sections, rather than logging only the first
difference found. When wsdiff encounters an ELF section difference, by default
it will log the difference associated with that section only, and move on. -V forces
wsdiff to log all ELF section differences found between two objects, rather than
just the first. Because of the extra work involved, this may slow wsdiff down
considerably.
.TP 10
.B -s
Produce sorted lists. This is handy when comparing multiple wsdiff outputs
because wsdiff runs in multithreaded mode so the list of differences is not
sorted and can differ between multiple runs.
.TP 10
.B -t
Look for the onbld tools in $SRC/tools rather than /opt/onbld/bin
.TP 10
.B -r
Log results to the specified log file. The log file contains a list of new, deleted,
and changed objects, as well as diffs signifying what wsdiff found to be different.
.TP 10
.B -i
Specify which objects should be compared by wsdiff via an input file list (See
EXAMPLES).
.LP
.SH OUTPUT
.LP
The list of objects appearing to differ between \fIold\fP and \fInew\fP is
printed to stdout. If -r was specified, the list of differing objects and
their differences are logged to \fIresults\fP.
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
Here is a complete list of environment variables that 
.I wsdiff
references and the meaning of each variable.
.LP
.RE
.B SRC
.RS 5
If -t was specified, this variable is used to lookup local tools.
It should be pointing to root of OS-Net source code, as referenced by the
Makefiles.
.RE
.LP
.B WSDIFF_DIFFOPTS
.RS 5
Extra options passed to diff(1) used internally.
.RE
.RE
.LP
.B DMAKE_MAX_JOBS
.RS 5
Number of threads to spawn. See EXAMPLES for details.
.RE
.LP
.SH NOTES
.LP
The proto area in a workspace can contain more than one proto root
directory if MULTI_PROTO is set. In addition, each proto root directory within
the proto area has an accompanying parallel stub root. To avoid confusing
output caused by these extra roots, wsdiff should not be used to compare
entire proto areas. Rather, the \fIold\fP and \fInew\fP arguments to wsdiff
should explicitly specify the root directories to be compared within the
proto areas.
.LP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fBExample 1: Using wsdiff to determine patch deliverables\fR
.PP
The following example shows how to use wsdiff to determine the set of objects
requiring (re)delivery via patch as a result of a given source change:
.LP
Starting with a built workspace, move the existing proto area aside:
.LP
.nf
user@example$ ls
Codemgr_wsdata/  proto/           usr/

user@example$ mv proto proto.old
.fi
.LP
Next, integrate the source changes, rebuild, and invoke wsdiff specifying the
old and new proto areas:
.LP
.nf
user@example$ ls
Codemgr_wsdata/  proto/           proto.old/      usr/

user@example$ wsdiff proto.old/root_sparc proto/root_sparc
platform/SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Sun-Fire-15000/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/sun4v/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/sun4u/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise-10000/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Sun-Fire/kernel/sparcv9/unix
.fi
.PP
\fBExample 2: The wsdiff results file\fR
.PP
With the -r option, wsdiff will log the list of objects that appear different, as well
as a set of diffs highlighting the observed difference:
.LP
.nf
user@example$ wsdiff -r results proto.old/root_sparc proto/root_sparc
platform/SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Sun-Fire-15000/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/sun4v/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/sun4u/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise-10000/kernel/sparcv9/unix
platform/SUNW,Sun-Fire/kernel/sparcv9/unix

user@example$ cat results
# This file was produced by wsdiff

\fBExample 3: Using an input file list\fR
.PP
The -i option tells wsdiff to compare a specific list of objects. This can be useful
in conjunction with other options that direct wsdiff to log more verbosely, allowing
one to "drill down" into a particular object's differences:
.LP
.nf
user@example$ echo "usr/lib/mdb/kvm/sparcv9/genunix.so" > flist
user@example$ wsdiff -vV -r results -i flist \\
              proto.old/root_sparc proto/root_sparc
usr/lib/mdb/kvm/sparcv9/genunix.so

user@example$ cat results
<... verbose differences only for genunix.so ...>
.fi
.PP
\fBExample 4: Invoking wsdiff through nightly(1)\fR
.PP
By specifying -w in NIGHTLY_OPTIONS, nightly(1) will use wsdiff(1) to determine
which objects look different, compared to the previous build. A pre-existing proto area
must exist for wsdiff(1) to compare against. nightly(1) will move aside the
pre-existing proto area (renaming it to $ROOT.prev under proto), and will
invoke wsdiff at the end of the build. The list of changed objects will be reported
in the nightly mail message, and a results file "wsdiff_results" will appear in the
nightly log area.
.PP
\fBExample 5: Influencing the level of paralelism\fR
.PP
wsdiff spawns a number of threads by default after it determines the list
of files for comparison. Default number of threads is based on the number of
on-line CPUs present in the system. To set the number of threads for processing
to some other value the DMAKE_MAX_JOBS environment variable can be used:
.LP
.nf
$ DMAKE_MAX_JOBS=24 wsdiff proto_base/root_sparc proto_patch/root_sparc
.fi
.PP
Note that this variable is also used for nightly(1) so when run from
nightly(1), wsdiff will honor the setting.
