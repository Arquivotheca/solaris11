# Check versioning information.
#
# This script descends a directory hierarchy inspecting ELF shared objects for
# version definitions.  The general theme is to verify that common versioning
# rules have been used to build these objects.
#
# As always, a number of components don't follow the rules, or require
# special handling. An exceptions file is used to specify these cases.
#
# By default any file that has conditions that should be reported is first
# listed and then each condition follows.  The -o (one-line) option produces a
# more terse output which is better for sorting/diffing with "nightly".
#
# Besides the default operation of checking the files within a directory
# hierarchy, a detailed analysis of each files versions can be created with the
# -d option.  The database created is useful for auditing the difference between
# different builds, and for thus monitoring that versioning changes are made in
# a compatible manner.


# Define all global variables (required for strict)
use vars  qw($Prog $Intfdir);
use vars  qw(%opt @SaveArgv $ErrFH $ObjCnt);


# An exception file is used to specify regular expressions to match
# objects. These directives specify special attributes of the object.
# The regular expressions are read from the file and compiled into the
# regular expression variables.
#
# The name of each regular expression variable is of the form
#
#	$EXRE_xxx
#
# where xxx is the name of the exception in lower case. For example,
# the regular expression variable for PLUGINS is $EXRE_plugins.
#
# onbld_elfmod::LoadExceptionsToEXRE() depends on this naming convention
# to initialize the regular expression variables, and to detect invalid
# exception names.
#
# If a given exception is not used in the exception file, its regular
# expression variable will be undefined. Users of these variables must
# test the variable with defined() prior to use:
#
#	defined($EXRE_plugins) && ($foo =~ $EXRE_plugins)
#
# ----
#
# The exceptions are:
#
# NONSTD_VERNAME
#	Objects are expected to use standard names for versions.
#	This directive is used to relax that requirement.
#
# NOVERDEF
#	Objects that are not required to have a versioned name. Note that
#	PLUGINS objects are implicitly NOVERDEF, so this directive is
#	for use with non-plugin objects.
#
# PLUGINS
#	Plugin objects are not required to have a versioned name, and are
#	not required to be internally versioned.
