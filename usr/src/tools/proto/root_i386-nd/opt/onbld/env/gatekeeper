#	Configuration variables for the runtime environment of the nightly
# build script and other tools for construction and packaging of releases.
# This script is sourced by 'nightly' and 'bldenv' to set up the environment
# for the build. This example is suitable for building a gate, 
# which will contain the resulting packages and archives (builds of the gate
# are done in children and then the resulting archives, packages, and proto
# area are put into the parent for everyone to use). It is based off
# the onnv release. It sets NIGHTLY_OPTIONS to make nightly do:
#	DEBUG and non-DEBUG builds (-D)
#	creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#	checks for new interfaces in libraries (-A)
#	runs 'make check' (-C)
#	runs lint in usr/src (-l plus the LINTDIRS variable)
#	sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#	updates the protolist in the parent for children to compare with (-u)
#	updates the proto area in the parent when done (-U)
#	checks for changes in ELF runpaths (-r)
#	checks for changes in unreferenced files (-f)
#

# nightly itself

# CODEMGR_WS - where is your workspace at (or what should nightly name it)
# there is only one definition here, which assumes all the gate build machines
# (sparc and x86) are set up the same. But remember, this is a script, so
# you _could_ look at $MACH or `uname -n` and set these variables differently.

# PARENT_WS is used to determine the parent of this workspace. This is
# for the options that deal with the parent workspace (such as where the
# proto area will go).

# If you use this, it must be local (or nfs): nightly cannot copy
# over ssh or http.
PARENT_WS="/ws/$GATE";				export PARENT_WS

# PARENT_ELF_DATA_DIR is used to determine where the usr/src/ELF-data.$MACH
# directory from the workspace is copied to when the -u nightly flag is
# specified. By default, it is copied to the PARENT_WS workspace.
#
# If you use this, it must be local (or nfs): nightly cannot copy

#
# You should not need to change this unless you wish to use locally cached
# baseline files. If you use this, it must be local (or nfs): nightly cannot
# copy over ssh or http.
#
# If ELF_DATA_BASELINE_AGE is non-0, and the age of the baseline exceeds
# the specified value, in days, a warning is written to the mail message
# and to the log file. Developers should leave this set to 0. Gatekeepers
# should set it to a reasonable value in order to ensure that the baseline
# files do not become stale due to a failure of the other gate to produce
# current files.
