.SH NAME
.I bringovercheck
\- Repair misordered workspace timestamps
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bringovercheck
workspace
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some versions of 
.I bringover(1) 
fail to 
.I msync(2)
writeable mappings; this results in indeterminate modification times
when the workspace exists on certain filesystems.  When this results
in SCCS s. files being newer than their respective checked-out source
files, build carnage may result (see
.I sccscheck(1)
for one mitigating step being taken).

If a workspace has been damaged by this bug, you can run
bringovercheck to detect and correct cases where a source file is
older than its corresponding SCCS s. file.

If no out-of-date files are found, bringovercheck will produce no
output; otherwise, it will produce a human-readable transcript
which includes filenames, last modification dates, and the output of
the sccs commands it uses to attempt to fix the problem.

Note that because the problem may involve deferred filesystem writes,
this script may not be fully effective if run immediately after a
bringover.
