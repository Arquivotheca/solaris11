.I flg.flp
\- list the files that bringover would bring over due to inc.flg and
req.flg files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBflg.flp [-r] [<dir>]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "flg.flp" "" "\fBflg.flp\fP"
.LP
.I flg.flp
uses the inc.flg and req.flg files contained within a workspace to
determine what additional files would be brought over if one were to
perform a bringover(1) of the specified directory. The resulting list of
files, specified relative to \fICODEMGR_WS\fP, is sent to standard output.
.LP
At most one directory may be specified; if none is specified, the current
working directory is assumed.  A relative directory is assumed to be
relative to the current directory or relative to \fICODEMGR_WS\fP, in that
order.  
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B -r	
Output the list of files relative to the current working directory, rather
than \fICODEMGR_WS\fP.
