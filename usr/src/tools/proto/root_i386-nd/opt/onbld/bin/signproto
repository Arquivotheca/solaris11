# signproto cred_file
#
# Utility to find cryptographic modules in the proto area and
# sign them using signit. Since the binaries have already been
# signed (using development keys) during the build process,
# we determine the correct signing credential to use based on
# the existing signature. The cred_file argument contains a
# list of signing server credentials and the corresponding
# regular expressions to match against the file signatures.

# Get absolute path of current directory; used later to invoke signit
cd .
