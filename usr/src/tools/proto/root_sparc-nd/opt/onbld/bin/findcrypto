# findcrypto cred_file
#
# Utility to find cryptographic modules in the proto area.  Prints out
# one line for each binary, using the form
#
#   cred path
#
# where "path" identifies the binary (relative to $ROOT), and "cred"
# says how the binary should get signed.
#
# The cred_file argument is the same as for signproto.sh.
#

# Directories in proto area that may contain crypto objects
DIRS="platform kernel usr/lib/security"

# Read list of credentials and regular expressions
