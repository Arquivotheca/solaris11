.SH NAME
.I onu
\- Os/Net Update
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBonu [opts] [-s <beName>] -t <beName>\fP
.br
\fBonu [opts] -r\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "onu" "" "\fBonu\fP"
.LP
.I onu 
is a convenience wrapper for native IPS commands
used to update a system with the latest set of IPS packages for the ON
(OS/Net) consolidation of Solaris, using beadm(1M) to create a new Boot
Environment (BE) and pkg(1) to update the image.
.LP
.I onu
can also be used to configure a current BE in preparation for update
or to install additional packages and/or zones.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following global options are supported:
.TP 4
.B \-d <dir>
Specifies that <dir> contains repo.redist and repo.extra sub-directories;
.I onu
will configure and use these as
.I file:
repositories.  Note that -d ignores -u, -U, -e, and -E, as well
as the environment variables used by those options.
.TP 4
.B \-e <URI>
Specifies that <URI> should be used as the origin URI for the extra repository.
See \fBONEXTRAURI\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-E <publisher>
Specifies that <publisher> should be used as the publisher name for
the extra repository.  See \fBONEXTRAPUB\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-O
Open mode, where the extra repository will not be used.
.TP 4
.B \-u <URI>
Specifies that <URI> should be used as the origin URI for the publisher
packaging repository.  See \fBONURI\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-U <publisher>
Specifies that <publisher> should be used as the publisher name for
the packaging repository.  See \fBONPUB\fP below for default values.
.TP 4
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.LP
The first form of onu creates a new BE and then updates it, and takes
the following options:
.TP 4
.B \-s <beName>
Specifies that <beName> should be used as the source Boot Environment to
clone.  The default is the active BE.
.TP 4
.B \-t <beName>
Specifies the target BE name.  This argument is required; there
is no default value.
.TP 4
.B \-Z
Do not update any installed zones.
.LP
The second form of onu takes the following option:
.TP 4
.B \-r
In the current BE, configure the requested publishers appropriately,
without updating.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.TP 4
.B 0
The command completed successfully.
No errors or warnings were reported.
.LP
.TP 4
.B 1
Incorrect usage.
.LP
.TP 4
.B 2
One of the commands used by the script failed.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Former users of bfu should note the following ways in which onu behaves
differently from bfu.  First, as noted above, onu creates a new BE, rather
than updating an existing BE in-place.  Second, onu will not install packages
that are older than what is already installed in the source BE.  Third,
conflicts in system configuration files are automatically resolved according
to the files' "preserve" attribute, as described in pkg(5).
.LP
New publishers are now preserved in the new BE.  However, if the
publisher location refers to a directory you later delete, you may
not be able to perform any package operations until you disable the
.B on-nightly
and
.B on-extra
publishers.  This can be done with pkg unset-publisher or
pkg set-publisher --disable.
.LP
Use of
.I onu
will prevent use of zone attach for solaris/ipkg-brand zones in the
new BE, since the
.B entire
incorporation is removed.
.LP
By default,
.I onu
will attempt to update any solaris/ipkg-brand installed zones on the
system; the
.B -Z
option may be used to disable this behavior.

external users where an extra repository does not apply, use the -O option.
