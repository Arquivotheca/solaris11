Deal with Mercurial versioning.

At a basic level, code to verify that the version of Mercurial in use
is suitable for use with Cadmium, and compare that version for the
sake of adapting to Mercurial API changes.

# It is important that this module rely on as little of Mercurial as
# is possible.
#

#
# Mercurial >= 1.2 has util.version(), prior versions
# version.get_version() We discover which to use this way, rather than
# via ImportError to account for mercurial.demandimport delaying the
# ImportError exception.
