# For each such verb, the global level of the main:: namespace must
# have a variable named $EXRE_verb. The $EXRE_ prefix must only be used
# for these variables, and not for any other. The caller must define these
# variables, but leave them undefined.
#
# entry:
#	Any variables in the main:: global symbol table starting with
#	the prefix 'EXRE_xxx' are taken to represent the regular expression
#	for the exception named xxx.
#
#	name - Name of script (i.e. 'check_rtime')
#	$main::opt{e} - Calling program must accept a '-e' option
#		that allows the user to specify an exception file
#		to use, and the value of that option must be found
#		in $main::opt{e}.
#
# exit:
#	The $main::EXRE_xxx variables are updated to contain any regular
#	expressions specified by the exception file. If a given exception
#	is not encountered, its variable is not modified.
#
# note:
#	We expand strings of the form MACH(dir) to match the given
#	directory as well as any 64-bit architecture subdirectory that
#	might be present (i.e. amd64, sparcv9).
