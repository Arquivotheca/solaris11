.SH NAME
.I signproto
\- sign ELF objects in proto area
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsignproto \fIcred_file\fP
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "OS-Net build tools" "signproto" "" "\fBsignproto\fP"
.LP
.I signproto
finds ELF objects in the ON proto area and re-signs them
using 
.IR signit (1).
This operation is normally invoked only for
release builds, as it replaces the internal development
signatures with official Sun signatures. The actual signing using
Sun's private key is performed by a code signing server which
is accessed via
.IR signit .
.LP
Cryptographic modules are identified by examining the signature
embedded by
.IR elfsign (1)
during the build process. 
.I signproto
requires a single command-line argument, which is a file containing
the mapping between each signing server credential name and the Subject
Distinguished Name (DN) of the certificate used to 
sign the ELF file. Each line in the file contains a credential name
followed by a regular expression. The first regular expression that
matches the Subject DN embedded in the ELF file determines the 
credential name passed to
.I signit
to re-sign the file.
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
.TP 4
.B CODESIGN_USER
Login name for the code signing server passed to
.I signit .
If this variable is not set, the value in LOGNAME is used instead.
.LP
.TP 4
.B ROOT
Location of ON proto area containing files to be signed.
