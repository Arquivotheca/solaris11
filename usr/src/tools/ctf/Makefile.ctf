# A `make install' from the tools directory needs to work, even if the rest of
# the tree hasn't been built.  As such, we need to tell the ctf builds how
# to find the ctf specific headers located outside the tools subtree. We also 
# want to tell them how to get to the common tools source files.
# 
# For additonal details on the ordering of includes via -I, see the comments
# in $(SRC)/tools/ctf/common/ctf_headers.h.
