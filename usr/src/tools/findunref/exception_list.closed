# An unfortunate artifact of the bridged, split gate is that closed-source
# deleted files go where findunref can accidentally find them...
#
# And an unfortunate artifact of using these tools with both full Teamware
# and split, non-Teamware workspaces is that sometimes closed/deleted_files
# won't exist, so we need the ISUSED directive here.
#
# ISUSED - let checkpaths know that the next entry is good.
