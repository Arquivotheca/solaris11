ural \- Ralink RT2500USB 802.11b/g Wireless Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBural\fR \fI802.11b/g\fR wireless NIC driver is  a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable,  GLDv3-based  STREAMS driver supporting the Ralink RT2500USB chipset-based NIC's.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBural\fR driver performs auto-negotiation  to  determine the data  rate  and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported \fI802.11g\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec. The \fBural\fR driver supports only BSS  networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open" (or "open-system") or "shared system" authentication.
