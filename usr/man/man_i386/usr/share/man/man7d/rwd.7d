.SH NAME
rwd \- Ralink RT2561/RT2561S/RT2661 IEEE802.11b/g wireless network driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The rwd IEEE802.11b/g wireless network driver is a multithreaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting Ralink RT2561/RT2561S/RT2661 IEEE802.11b/g wireless network driver.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrwd\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. The driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open"(or "open-system") or "shared system" authentication. For wireless security,  WEP encryption, WPA-PSk, and WPA2-PSK are currently supported. You can perform configuration and administration tasks using the \fBdladm\fR(1M) utility.
