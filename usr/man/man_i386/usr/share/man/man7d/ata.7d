ata \- AT attachment disk driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBide@unit-\fR\fIaddress\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBata\fR driver supports disk and ATAPI CD/DVD devices conforming to the AT Attachment specification including IDE interfaces. Support is provided for both parallel ATA (PATA) and serial ATA (SATA) interfaces.
.sp
.LP
Refer to the \fISolaris x86 Hardware Compatibility List\fR for a list of supported controllers.
.SH PRECONFIGURE
.sp
.LP
A PCI IDE controller can operate in compatibility mode or in PCI-native mode. If more than one controller is present in the system, only one can operate in compatibility mode.
.sp
.LP
If two PATA drives share the same controller, you must set one to master and the other to slave. If both a PATA disk drive and a PATA CD-ROM drive utilize the same controller, you can designate the disk drive as the master with the CD-ROM drive as the slave, although this is not mandatory.

This driver does not support any RAID features present on a PATA/SATA controller. As a result, you should configure BIOS to select IDE mode rather than RAID mode. Some systems may require updating BIOS to allow switching modes.
.RE

On some systems, the SATA controller must have option ROM enabled or BIOS will not consider SATA drives as bootable devices.

CMD-604 is unable to handle simultaneous I/O on both IDE interfaces. This defect causes the Solaris software to hang if both interfaces are used. Use only the primary IDE interface at address 0x1F0.

Sony CDU-701 CD-ROM drives must be upgraded to use firmware version 1.0r or later to support booting from the CD.
.sp
A Compact Flash(CF) card can work as an ATA disk through a CF-to-ATA adapter. If both card and adapter implement Compact Flash Version 2.0, DMA is supported. If either of them does not, you should set ata-disk-dma-enabled to '0.'
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The ata driver properties are usually set in \fBata.conf\fR. However, it may be convenient, or in some cases necessary, for you to set some of the DMA related properties as a system global boot environment property. You set or modify properties in the boot environment immediately prior to booting the Solaris kernel using the GRUB boot loader kernel boot command line. You can also set boot environment properties using the \fBeeprom\fR(1M) command or by editing the \fBbootenv.rc\fR configuration file. If a property is set in both the driver's \fBata.conf\fR file and the boot environment, the \fBata.conf\fR property takes precedence.
.sp
.LP
Property modifications other than with the GRUB kernel  boot  command  line are not effective until you reboot the system.  Property modifications via the GRUB kernel  boot command  line do not persist across future boots.
.sp
.LP
Direct Memory Access is enabled for disks and atapi CD/DVD by default. If you want to disable DMA when booting from a CD/DVD, you must first set atapi-cd-dma-enabled  to 0 using the GRUB kernel boot command line.

This property is examined before the DMA properties discussed below. If it is set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all ATA/ATAPI devices, and no further property checks are made. If this property is absent or is set to '1,' DMA status is determined by further examining one of the other properties listed below.

.sp
If ata-disk-dma-enabled set to '0,' DMA is disabled for all ATA disks in the system. If this property is absent or set to '1,' DMA is enabled for all ATA disks and no further property checks are made. If needed, this property should be created by the administrator using the GRUB kernel boot command line or the \fBeeprom\fR(1M) command.

The Solaris installation program creates this property in the boot environment with a value of '1.' It can be changed with the GRUB kernel boot command line or \fBeeprom\fR(1M) as shown in the Example section of this manpage.

\fBATA\fR controllers support some amount of buffering (blocking). The purpose is to interrupt the host when an entire buffer full of data has been read or written instead of using an interrupt for each sector. This reduces interrupt overhead and significantly increases throughput. The driver interrogates the controller to find the buffer size. Some controllers hang when buffering is used, so the values in the configuration file are used by the driver to reduce the effect of buffering (blocking). The values presented may be chosen from \fB0x1\fR, \fB0x2\fR, \fB0x4\fR, \fB0x8\fR and \fB0x10\fR.
.sp
The values as shipped are set to \fB0x1\fR, and they can be tuned to increase performance.
.sp
If your controller hangs when attempting to use higher block factors, you may be unable to reboot the system. For x86 based systems, it is recommended that tuning be performed using a duplicate of the \fB/platform/i86pc/kernel\fR directory subtree. This ensures that a bootable kernel subtree exists in the event of a failed test.

When rebooting or shutting down, the driver can set a feature which allows the drive to return to the power-on settings when the drive receives a software reset (SRST) sequence. If this property is present and set to 1, the driver will set the feature to revert to defaults during reset. Setting this property to 1 may prevent some systems from soft-rebooting and would require cycling the power to boot the system. If this property is not present the system will not set the feature to revert to defaults during reset.
.sp
To determine the string to substitute for <diskmodel>, boot your system (you may have to press the reset button or power-cycle) and then view \fB/var/adm/messages\fR. Look for the string "IDE device at targ" or "ATAPI device at targ." The next line will contain the word "model" followed by the model number and a comma. Ignore all characters except letters, digits, ".", "_", and "-". Change uppercase letters to lower case. If the string revert-<diskmodel> is longer than 31 characters, use only the first 31 characters.
