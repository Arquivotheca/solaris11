.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcmdk\fR device driver is a common interface to various disk devices. The driver supports magnetic fixed disks and magnetic removable disks.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcmdk\fR device driver supports three different disk labels: fdisk partition table, Solaris x86 VTOC and EFI/GPT.
.sp
.LP
The block-files access the disk using the system's normal buffering mechanism and are read and written without regard to physical disk records. There is also a "raw" interface that provides for direct transmission between the disk and the user's read or write buffer. A single read or write call usually results in one I/O operation; raw I/O is therefore considerably more efficient when many bytes are transmitted. The names of the block files are found in \fB/dev/dsk\fR. Raw file names are found in \fB/dev/rdsk\fR.
.sp
.LP
I/O requests to the magnetic disk must have an offset and transfer length that is a multiple of 512 bytes or the driver returns an \fBEINVAL\fR error.
.sp
.LP
Slice 0 is normally used for the root file system on a disk, slice 1 as a paging area (for example, swap), and slice 2 for backing up the entire fdisk partition for Solaris software. Other slices may be used for \fBusr\fR file systems or system reserved area.
.sp
.LP
The fdisk partition 0 is to access the entire disk and is generally used by the \fBfdisk\fR(1M) program.
