.SH NAME
ath \- Atheros AR52xx 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBath\fR \fI802.11b/g \fR wireless  NIC driver is a  multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver for the Atheros  AR52xx  (AR5210/5211/5212)  chipset-based  wireless NIC.
.sp
.LP
The \fBath\fR driver functions include controller initialization, wireless \fI802.11b/g\fR infrastructure network connection, WEP, frame transmit and receive, and promiscuous and multi-cast  support.
.SH DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBath\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rates and mode. Supported \fI802.11b\fR data rates (Mbits/sec.) are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11. Supported \fI802.11g\fR data rates (Mbits/sec.) are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54.
.sp
.LP
The \fBath\fR driver supports only BSS networks (also known  as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and the "open" (or "opensystem") authentication type. Only  WEP encryption is currently supported. Configuration and administration can be performed  through  the  \fBdladm\fR(1M) utility.
