.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwpi\fR \fI802.11b/g\fR wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting the Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG chipset-based NIC's.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwpi\fR driver performs auto-negotiation  to determine the data rate and mode. Supported \fI802.11b\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported \fI802.11g\fR data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec.
