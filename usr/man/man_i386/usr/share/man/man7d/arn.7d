.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBarn\fR IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless driver is a loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver supporting Atheros AR9280/9281/9285 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network device.
.SS "Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The \fBarn\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. The driver supports only BSS networks (also known as \fBap\fR or \fBinfrastructure\fR networks) and \fBopen\fR(or \fBopen-system\fR)  or \fBshared system\fR authentication. For wireless security, WEP encryption, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK are currently supported. Configuration and administration tasks can be performed with the \fBdladm\fR(1M) utility.
