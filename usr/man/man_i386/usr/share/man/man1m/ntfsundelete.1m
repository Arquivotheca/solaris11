.SH NAME
ntfsundelete \- recover a deleted file from an NTFS volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBntfsundelete\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfsundelete\fR utility can, under the right circumstances, recover a deleted file from an NTFS volume. The command has three modes of operation:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBScan\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The default mode, \fBscan\fR simply reads an NTFS Volume and looks for files that have been deleted. It then displays a list, giving the inode number, name, and size of each deleted file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBUndelete\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The undelete mode takes the files either matching the regular expression (option \fB-m\fR) or specified by the \fIinode-expressions\fR and recovers as much of the data as possible. It saves the result to another location.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBCopy\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The "wizard's" option. Saves a portion of the MFT to a file, which can be useful when debugging \fBntfsundelete\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
There are many circumstances under which \fBntfsundelete\fR is unable to recover a file. For example, consider the following scenario. When a file is deleted the MFT Record is marked as not in use and the bitmap representing the disk usage is updated. If the power is not turned off immediately, the free space, where the file used to reside might get overwritten. Worse, the MFT Record might be reused for another file. If this happens, it is impossible to tell where the file was on disk.
.sp
.LP
Even if all the clusters of a file are not in use, there is no guarantee that they have not been overwritten by some short-lived file.
.sp
.LP
\fBntfsundelete\fR cannot recover compressed or encrypted files. During a scan, it will display such a file as being 0% recoverable.
.SS "Locale"
.sp
.LP
In NTFS, all filenames are stored as Unicode. A filename is converted into the current locale for display by \fBntfsundelete\fR. The utility has successfully displayed Chinese pictogram filenames and then correctly recovered them.
.SS "Extended MFT Records"
.sp
.LP
In rare circumstances, a single MFT Record will not be large enough to hold the metadata describing a file (a file would have to be in hundreds of fragments for this to happen). In these cases, one MFT record might hold the filename, while another will hold the information about the data. \fBntfsundelete\fR will not try and piece together such records. It will simply list unnamed files with data.
.SS "Recovered File's Size and Creation Date"
.sp
.LP
To recover a file, \fBntfsundelete\fR has to read the file's metadata. Unfortunately, when a file is deleted, the metadata can be left in an inconsistent state. For example, the file size might be recorded as zero; the creation date of a file might be set to the time it was deleted or to a random time. In such situations, \fBntfsundelete\fR picks the largest file size it finds and writes that to disk. It also tries to set the file's creation date to the last-modified date. This date might be the correct last modified date, or something unexpected.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR. A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR, \fB--byte\fR \fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Fill in the parts of unrecoverable file clusters with byte represented by \fInum\fR. The default is zeros.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR, \fB--case\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Make filename search, when attempting a match with the \fB--match\fR option, case-sensitive. The default filename search is case-insensitive.

.na
\fB\fB-c\fR, \fB--copy\fR \fIrange\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This "wizard" option writes a block of MFT FILE records to a file. The default file is mft which will be created in the current directory. This option can be combined with the \fB--output\fR and \fB--destination\fR options.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR, \fB--destination\fR \fIdir\fR\fR

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR, \fB--force\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR, \fB--inodes\fR \fIrange\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR, \fB--match\fR \fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Filter the output by looking only for filenames that match \fIpattern\fR. The pattern can include the wildcards \fB?\fR, matching exactly one character, or \fB*\fR, matching zero or more characters. By default, the matching is case-insensitive. To make the search case-sensitive, use the \fB--case\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-O\fR, \fB--optimistic\fR\fR

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR, \fB--scan\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Search through an NTFS volume and display a list of files that could be recovered. This is the default action of \fBntfsundelete\fR.  This list can be filtered by filename, size, percentage recoverable, or last modification time, using  the  \fB--match\fR, \fB--size\fR,  \fB--percent\fR,  and \fB--time\fR options, respectively.
.sp
In the output from this option, the \fB%age\fR (percentage) field displays how much of a file can potentially be recovered.
