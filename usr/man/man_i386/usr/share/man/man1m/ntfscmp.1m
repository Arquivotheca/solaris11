.TH ntfscmp 1M "28 May 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
ntfscmp \- compare two NTFS file systems and report the differences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBntfscmp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice1\fR \fIdevice2\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfscmp\fR utility compares all aspects of two NTFS file systems and reports all differences it finds. The file systems can be on block devices or in image files. \fBntfscmp\fR can be used for volume verification. However, its primary purpose is to be an efficient development tool, used to quickly locate, identify, and check the correctness of the metadata changes made to NTFS.
.sp
.LP
If one is interested only in the NTFS metadata changes,  it can be useful to compare the metadata images created by using the \fB--metadata\fR option of \fBntfsclone\fR(1M) to eliminate the usually uninteresting timestamp changes.
.sp
.LP
The terse output of \fBntfscmp\fR is intentional, because the  provided information is sufficient to determine  exact differences. More copious output can be obtained by using \fBdiff\fR(1) to compare the  verbose output of \fBntfsinfo\fR(1M) for each reported inode.
