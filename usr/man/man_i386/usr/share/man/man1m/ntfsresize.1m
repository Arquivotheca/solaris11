.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfsresize\fR program safely resizes Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows NT4 and Longhorn NTFS filesystems without data loss. All NTFS versions used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows "operating systems" are supported. Defragmentation is not required prior to resizing, because \fBntfsresize\fR can relocate any data if needed, without risking data integrity.
.sp
.LP
\fBntfsresize\fR can be used to shrink or enlarge any NTFS file system located on an unmounted device (usually a disk partition). The new file system will have a size that you specify. The size parameter can have one of the optional modifiers \fBk\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBG\fR, denoting, respectively, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. \fBntfsresize\fR conforms to the SI, ATA, an IEEE standards and the disk manufacturers by supporting \fBk=10\fR^3, \fBM=10\fR^6 and \fBG=10\fR^9.
.sp
.LP
If both \fB---info\fR and \fB---size\fR options are omitted then the NTFS file system will be enlarged to the underlying device size.
.sp
.LP
To resize a file system on a partition, you must resize both the file system and the partition, by editing the partition table on the disk. Similarly to other command-line file system resizers, \fBntfsresize\fR does not manipulate the size of the partitions. To do that you must use a disk  partitioning tool, such as \fBfdisk\fR(1M). Alternatively, you could use one of the many user friendly partitioners that uses  \fBntfsresize\fR internally. Such partitioners include, among others, Mandriva's DiskDrake, QTParted, SUSE/Novell's YaST Partitioner, IBM's EVMS, GParted, or Debian/Ubuntu's Partman.
.sp
.LP
Back up your data and your partition table before using any partitioning tool. For an NTFS file system, you can use \fBntfsclone\fR(1M) as a means of backup.
.sp
.LP
To shrink an NTFS partition, first use \fBntfsresize\fR to shrink the size of the file system. Then use a utility such as \fBfdisk\fR(1M) to shrink the size of the partition by deleting the partition and recreating it with the smaller size. Do not make the partition smaller than the new size of NTFS; otherwise, you will not be able to boot from that partition. If you mistakenly made a too-small partition, you would have to recreate the partition to be as large as newly sized NTFS file system.
.sp
.LP
To enlarge an NTFS file system, you must first enlarge the size of the underlying partition. You can use \fBfdisk\fR(1M) to delete the partition and recreate it with a larger size. Make sure the newly sized partition does not overlap with any other partition. Then use \fBntfsresize\fR to enlarge the file system.
.sp
.LP
When recreating a partition, make sure you create it at the same starting sector and with the same partition type as was used in the partition you are replacing. Otherwise, you will not be able to access your file system. Use the \fBfdisk u\fR command to switch from the default cylinder unit to the reliable sector unit. Also, if the bootable flag was set in the old partition, make sure to set it in the recreated partiton. Otherwise, you might not be able to boot from the new partition.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
There are a handful of very rarely met restrictions in the use of \fBntfsresize\fR. An example of such a restriction occurs with a file system stored on a disk having unknown bad sectors. Relocation of the first \fBMFT\fR extent and resizing into the middle of a \fB$MFTMirr\fR extent  are not supported. These cases are detected and resizing is restricted to a safe size or the closest safe size is displayed.
.sp
.LP
Upon completion of a resizing, \fBntfsresize\fR schedules an NTFS consistency check. In Windows, this check is performed by \fBchkdsk\fR. Upon the first subsequent reboot into Windows, you will note \fBchkdsk\fR running in a blue background. This is normal. Windows might force a quick reboot after the consistency check. Depending on your hardware configuration, Windows might alert you to a systems setting change and recommend or require a reboot. Acknowledge the message and reboot a second time.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR. A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.

.na
\fB\fB-b\fR, \fB--bad-sectors\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
By default, \fBntfsresize\fR exits upon encountering bad sectors. This option allows the utility to proceed in spite of such sectors.
.sp
Prior using this option, it is strongly recommended that you use \fBntfsclone\fR(1M) with the \fB--rescue\fR option to make a backup, then, in Windows, run \fBchkdsk /f /r volume\fR: from the command line. If the disk guarantee displays as valid, then replace it, as it is defective. Note that no software can repair bad sector errors. The most that can be done is to work around these defects.
.sp
This option has no effect if a disk has no bad sectors.

.RS 4n
\fBntfsresize\fR always marks a file system for consistency check before a real (not using \fB--no-action\fR) resize operation and it leaves that way for extra safety. Thus, if an NTFS file system was marked by \fBntfsresize\fR, it is safe to use this option. You must use this option, if you need to resize several times without booting into Windows between each resizing step.

Used when you want to shrink a file system. Causes \fBntfsresize\fR to determine the smallest shrunken file system size supported. Most of the time the smallest size is the space already used on the file system. \fBntfsresize\fR does not shrink a file system to a smaller size than what is returned by this option. Depending on several factors, it might be unable to shrink to this theoretical size. Although the integrity of your data should be never at risk, it is nevertheless strongly recommended to make a test run by using the \fB--no-action\fR option before actual resizing.
.sp
Based on testing, the smallest attainable size is approximately space used in the file system plus 20-200 MB. Note also that Windows might need an additional 50-100 MB to boot safely.
.sp
This option never causes any changes to the file system; the partition is opened read-only.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In Linux version 2.6, with partitions that have been manipulated by \fBparted\fR(1M), use of \fBntfsresize\fR preceded corruption of partition tables, which resulted in unbootable Windows systems. This occurred even if the NTFS file system was consistent. This problem is independent of NTFS and, thus, \fBntfsresize\fR. Moreover, \fBntfsresize\fR never touches the partition table. Under the conditions just described, you can, in the BIOS, change \fBDisk Access Mode\fR to \fBLBA\fR to regain the ability to boot. For further discussion of this condition see the \fBntfsresize\fR FAQ at: \fBhttp://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfsresize.html\fR.
