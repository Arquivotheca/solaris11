.TH ntfscp 1M "28 May 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
ntfscp \- copy file to an NTFS volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBntfscp\fR  [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR \fIsource_file\fR \fIdestination\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfscp\fR utility copies files to an NTFS volume. \fIdestination\fR (see Synopis) can be either a file or a directory. If \fIdestination\fR is a directory specified by name, \fIsource_file\fR is copied into this directory. If \fIdestination\fR is a directory specified by inode number, an unnamed data attribute is created for this inode and \fIsource_file\fR is copied into it. Consider  possible negative consequence before specifying a directory by inode number: it is unusual to have an unnamed data stream in a directory.
.SS "Data Streams"
.sp
.LP
All data on NTFS is stored in streams, which can have names. A file can have more than one data stream, but exactly one must have no name. The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data stream. Usually, when you do not specify a stream name, you are seeking access to the unnamed data stream. If you want access to a named data stream, you need to add \fB:\fR\fIstream_name\fR to the filename. For example, by opening \fBsome.mp3:artist\fR you will open stream \fBartist\fR in \fBsome.mp3\fR. In an operating system, such as Windows, that prevents you from accessing named data streams, you need to use some program like \fBFAR\fR or utilities from \fBcygwin\fR to access those streams.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR. A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.

\fBExample 1 \fRCopying from Home to Root Directory
.sp
.LP
The following command copies \fBnew_boot.ini\fR from \fB/home/user\fR as \fBboot.ini\fR to the root of an \fB/dev/dsk/c0d0p1\fR NTFS volume.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBntfscp /dev/dsk/c0d0p1 /home/user/new_boot.ini boot.ini\fR
.fi
.in -2

\fBExample 2 \fRCopying a Stream
.sp
.LP
The following command copies \fBmyfile\fR to \fBC:\some\path\myfile:stream\fR (assume that \fB/dev/dsk/c0d0p1\fR drive designator is \fBC\fR).

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBntfscp -N stream /dev/dsk/c0d0p1 myfile /some/path\fR
