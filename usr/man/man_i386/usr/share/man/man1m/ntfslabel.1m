.SH NAME
ntfslabel \- display or change the label on an NTFS file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBntfslabel\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR [\fInew_label\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBntfslabel\fR utility displays or changes the file system label on the NTFS file system located on \fIdevice\fR (see Synopsis).
.sp
.LP
If the optional argument \fInew_label\fR is not present, \fBntfslabel\fR displays the current file system label.
.sp
.LP
If the optional argument \fInew_label\fR is present, \fBntfslabel\fR sets the file system label to be \fInew_label\fR. NTFS file system labels can be at most 128 Unicode characters long; if \fInew_label\fR is longer than 128 Unicode characters, \fBntfslabel\fR truncates it and displays a warning message.
.sp
.LP
It is also possible to set the file system label using the \fB-L\fR option of \fBmkntfs\fR(1M) during creation of the file system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR. A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
