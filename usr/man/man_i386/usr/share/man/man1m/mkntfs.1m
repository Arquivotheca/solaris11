.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkntfs\fR utility is used to create an NTFS file system on a device, usually a disk partition, or file.  The \fIdevice\fR operand is the special file corresponding to the device; for example, \fB/dev/dsk/c0d0p0\fR. The \fInumber-of-sectors\fR operand is the number of blocks on the device. If omitted, \fBmkntfs\fR automatically figures the file system size.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, \fB-fv\fR is the equivalent of \fB-f\fR \fB-v\fR. A full-name option can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
.sp
.LP
Options are divided among basic, advanced, output, and help options, as listed below.
.SS "Basic Options"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR, \fB--enable-compression\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable compression on the volume.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR, \fB--fast\fR or \fB-q\fR, \fB--quick\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Perform quick (fast) format. This option skips both  zeroing of the volume and bad sector checking.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR, \fB--label\fR \fIstring\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the volume label for the filesystem to \fIstring\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR, \fB--no-action\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Causes \fBmkntfs\fR to not actually create a file system, but display what it would do if it were to create a file system. All formatting steps are carried out except the actual writing to the device.
.RE

.SS "Advanced Options"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR, \fB--cluster-size\fR \fIbytes\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the size of clusters in bytes. Valid cluster size values are powers of two, with at least 256, and at most 65536, bytes per cluster. If omitted, \fBmkntfs\fR uses 4096 bytes as the default cluster size.
.sp
Note that the default cluster size is set to be at least equal to the sector size, as a cluster cannot be smaller than a sector. Also, note that values greater than 4096 have the side effect that compression is disabled on the volume. This is due to limitations in the NTFS compression algorithm used by Windows.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR, \fB--force\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Force \fBmkntfs\fR to run, even if the specified  device is not a block special device, or appears to be mounted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR, \fB--heads\fR \fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the number of heads. The maximum is 65535 (0xffff). If omitted, \fBmkntfs\fR attempts to determine the number of heads automatically. If that fails a default of 0 is used. Note that specifying \fInum\fR is required for Windows to be able to boot from the created volume.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-I\fR, \fB--no-indexing\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable content indexing on the volume. This option is only meaningful on Windows 2000 and later. Windows NT 4.0 and earlier ignore this, as they do not implement content indexing.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR, \fB--partition-start\fR \fIsector\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the partition start sector. The maximum is 4294967295 (2^32-1). If omitted, \fBmkntfs\fR attempts to determine \fIsector\fRautomatically. If that fails, a default of 0 is used. Note that specifying \fIsector\fR is required for Windows to be able to boot from the created volume.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-S\fR, \fB--sectors-per-track\fR \fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the number of sectors per track. The maximum is 65535 (0xffff). If omitted, mkntfs attempts to  determine the number of sectors-per-track automatically and if that fails a default of 0 is used. Note that sectors-per-track is required for Windows to be able to boot from the created volume.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR, \fB--sector-size\fR \fIbytes\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the size of sectors in bytes. Valid sector size values are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. If omitted, \fBmkntfs\fR attempts to determine the sector-size automatically. If that fails, a default of 512 bytes per sector is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR, \fB--zero-time\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Fake the time to be 00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970, instead of the current system time. This can be useful for debugging purposes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR, \fB--mft-zone-multiplier\fR \fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the master file table (MFT) zone multiplier, which determines the size of the MFT zone to use on the volume. The MFT zone is the area at the beginning of the volume reserved for the MFT, which stores the on-disk inodes (MFT records). It is noteworthy that small files are stored entirely within the inode; thus, if you expect to use the volume for storing large numbers of very small files, it is useful to set the zone multiplier to a higher value. Although the MFT zone is resized on the fly as required during operation of the NTFS driver, choosing an optimal value reduces fragmentation. Valid values are \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, and \fB4\fR. The values have the following meaning:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
MFT zone        MFT zone size
multiplier      (% of volume size)
1       12.5% (default)

3       37.5%
4       50.0%
