.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdlpi_recv()\fR function attempts to receive data messages over the \fBDLPI\fR link instance associated with the \fBDLPI\fR handle \fIdh\fR. If \fIdh\fR is not in the \fBDL_IDLE\fR \fBDLPI\fR state, the attempt fails. The caller must ensure that \fImsgbuf\fR is at least \fImsglenp\fR bytes in size. Upon success, \fImsgbuf\fR contains the data message received, \fImsglenp\fR contains the number of bytes placed in \fImsgbuf\fR.
.sp
.LP
The caller must ensure that \fIsaddrp\fR is at least \fBDLPI_PHYSADDR_MAX\fR bytes in size and \fIsaddrlenp\fR must contain the length of \fIsaddrp\fR. Upon success, \fIsaddrp\fR contains the address of the source sending the data message and \fIsaddrlenp\fR contains the source address length. If the caller is not interested in the source address, both \fIsaddrp\fR and \fIsaddrlenp\fR can be left as \fINULL\fR. If the source address is not available, \fIsaddrp\fR is not filled in and \fIsaddrlenp\fR is set to zero.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdlpi_recvinfo_t\fR is a structure defined in \fB<libdlpi.h>\fR as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
typedef struct {
        uchar_t         dri_destaddr[DLPI_PHYSADDR_MAX];
        uchar_t         dri_destaddrlen;
        dlpi_addrtype_t dri_destaddrtype;
        size_t          dri_totmsglen;
} dlpi_recvinfo_t;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Upon success, if \fIrecvp\fR is not set to \fINULL\fR, \fIdri_destaddr\fR contains the destination address, \fIdri_destaddrlen\fR contains the destination address length, and \fIdri_totmsglen\fR contains the total length of the message received. If the destination address is unicast, \fIdri_destaddrtype\fR is set to \fBDLPI_ADDRTYPE_UNICAST\fR. Otherwise, it is set to \fBDLPI_ADDRTYPE_GROUP\fR.
.sp
.LP
The values of \fImsglenp\fR and \fIdri_totmsglen\fR might vary when a message larger than the size of \fImsgbuf\fR is received. In that case, the caller can use \fIdri_totmsglen\fR to determine the original total length of the message.
.sp
.LP
If the handle is in raw mode, as described in \fBdlpi_open\fR(3DLPI), \fImsgbuf\fR starts with the link-layer header. See \fBdlpi\fR(7P). The values of \fIsaddrp\fR, \fIsaddrlenp\fR, and all the members of \fIdlpi_recvinfo_t\fR except \fIdri_totmsglen\fR are invalid because the address information is already included in the link-layer header returned by \fImsgbuf\fR.
.sp
.LP
If no message is received within \fImsec\fR milliseconds, \fBdlpi_recv()\fR returns \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR. If \fImsec\fR is \fB0\fR, \fBdlpi_recv()\fR does not block. If \fImsec\fR is \fB-1\fR, \fBdlpi_recv()\fR does block until a data message is received. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon success, \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fR is returned. If \fBDL_SYSERR\fR is returned, \fBerrno\fR contains the specific UNIX system error value. Otherwise, a \fBDLPI\fR error value defined in \fB<sys/dlpi.h>\fR or an error value listed in the following section is returned.
