dlpi_set_timeout \- set DLPI handle timeout interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ... \fB-ldlpi\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <libdlpi.h>

\fBint\fR \fIdlpi_set_timeout\fR(\fBdlpi_handle_t\fR \fIdh\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsec\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdlpi_set_timeout()\fR function sets the timeout interval to \fIsec\fR seconds on DLPI handle \fIdh\fR. This timeout is used by \fBlibdlpi\fR(3LIB) functions that require explicit acknowledgment from the associated DLPI link, and bounds the number of seconds that a function will wait for an acknowledgment before returning \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR. Except for \fBdlpi_recv\fR(3DLPI), which has a \fItimeout\fR argument, any function that is documented to return \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR can take up to the \fItimeout\fR interval to complete.
.sp
.LP
Callers that do not require an upper bound on timeouts are strongly encouraged to never call \fBdlpi_set_timeout()\fR, and allow \fBlibdlpi\fR to use its default \fItimeout\fR value. The default \fItimeout\fR value is intended to ensure that \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR will only be returned if the DLPI link has truly become unresponsive. The default \fItimeout\fR value is intended to ensure that \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR will be returned only if the DLPI link has truly become unresponsive.
.sp
.LP
Callers that do require an explicit upper bound can specify that value at any time by calling \fBdlpi_set_timeout()\fR.  However, note that values less than 5 seconds may trigger spurious failures on certain DLPI links and systems under high load, and thus are discouraged. Attempts to set the \fItimeout\fR value to less than 1 second will fail.
.sp
.LP
If \fIsec\fR is set to \fBDLPI_DEF_TIMEOUT\fR, the default \fItimeout\fR value is restored.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon success, \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fR is returned. Otherwise, a \fBDLPI\fR error value is returned.
