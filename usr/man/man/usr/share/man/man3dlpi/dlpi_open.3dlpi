#include <libdlpi.h>

\fBint\fR \fBdlpi_open\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIlinkname\fR, \fBdlpi_handle_t *\fR\fIdhp\fR, 
     \fBuint_t\fR \fIflags\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdlpi_open()\fR function creates an open instance of the \fBDLPI\fR Version 2 link named by \fIlinkname\fR and associates it with a dynamically-allocated \fBdlpi_handle_t\fR, which is returned to the caller in \fIdhp\fR upon success. The \fBDLPI\fR handle is left in the \fBDL_UNBOUND\fR \fBDLPI\fR state after a successful open of the \fBDLPI\fR link. The DLPI handles can only be used by one thread at a time, but multiple handles can be used by multiple threads. This function can open both \fBDL_STYLE1\fR and \fBDL_STYLE2\fR \fBDLPI\fR links.
.sp
.LP
By default (if \fBDLPI_DEVIPNET\fR is not set in \fIflags\fR), the \fBdlpi_open()\fR function scans the \fB/dev/net\fR and \fB/dev\fR directories for DLPI links, in order. Within each scanned directory, \fBdlpi_open()\fR first looks for a matching \fBDL_STYLE1\fR link, then for a matching \fBDL_STYLE2\fR link. If \fIprovider\fR is considered the \fIlinkname\fR with its trailing digits removed, a matching \fBDL_STYLE1\fR link has a filename of \fIlinkname\fR, and a matching \fBDL_STYLE2\fR link has a filename of \fIprovider\fR. If a \fBDL_STYLE2\fR link is opened, \fBdlpi_open()\fR automatically performs the necessary \fBDLPI\fR operations to place the \fBDLPI\fR link instance and the associated \fBDLPI\fR handle in the \fBDL_UNBOUND\fR state. See \fBdlpi\fR(7P) for the definition of \fIlinkname\fR and the maximum supported length of the Solaris DLPI \fIlinkname\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fBDLPI_DEVIPNET\fR is set in \fIflags\fR, \fBdlpi_open()\fR opens the file \fIlinkname\fR in \fB/dev/ipnet\fR as a \fBDL_STYLE1\fR DLPI device and does not look in any other directories.
.sp
.LP
The value of \fIflags\fR is constructed by a bitwise-inclusive-OR of the flags listed below, defined in \fB<libdlpi.h>\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDLPI_DEVIPNET\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Specify that the named DLPI device is an IP observability device (see \fBipnet\fR(7D)), and \fBdl_open()\fR will open the device from the \fB/dev/ipnet/\fR directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDLPI_IPNETINFO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
This flag is applicable only when opening IP Observability devices (with \fBDLPI_DEVIPNET\fR or by opening the \fB/dev/lo0\fR device). This flag causes the \fBipnet\fR driver to prepend an \fBipnet\fR header to each received IP packet. See \fBipnet\fR(7D) for the contents of this header.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDLPI_NATIVE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Enable \fBDLPI\fR native mode (see \fBDLIOCNATIVE\fR in \fBdlpi\fR(7P)) on a \fBDLPI\fR link instance. Native mode persists until the \fBDLPI\fR handle is closed by \fBdlpi_close\fR(3DLPI).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDLPI_PASSIVE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Enable \fBDLPI\fR passive mode (see \fBDL_PASSIVE_REQ\fR in \fBdlpi\fR(7P)) on a \fBDLPI\fR link instance. Passive mode persists until the \fBDLPI\fR handle is closed by \fBdlpi_close\fR(3DLPI).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDLPI_RAW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Enable \fBDLPI\fR raw mode (see \fBDLIOCRAW\fR in \fBdlpi\fR(7P)) on a \fBDLPI\fR link instance. Raw mode persists until the \fBDLPI\fR handle is closed by \fBdlpi_close\fR(3DLPI).
.RE

.sp
.LP
Each \fBDLPI\fR handle has an associated timeout value that is used as a timeout interval for certain \fBlibdlpi\fR operations. The default timeout value ensures that \fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fR is returned from a \fBlibdlpi\fR operation only in the event that the \fBDLPI\fR link becomes unresponsive. The timeout value can be changed with \fBdlpi_set_timeout\fR(3DLPI), although this should seldom be necessary.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon success, \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fR is returned. If \fBDL_SYSERR\fR is returned, \fBerrno\fR contains the specific UNIX system error value. Otherwise, a \fBDLPI\fR error value defined in \fB<sys/dlpi.h>\fR or listed in the following section is returned.
