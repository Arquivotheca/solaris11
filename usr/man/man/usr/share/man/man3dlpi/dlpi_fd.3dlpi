.SH NAME
dlpi_fd \- get DLPI file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ... \fB-ldlpi\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <libdlpi.h>

\fBint\fR \fIdlpi_fd\fR(\fBdlpi_handle_t\fR \fIdh\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdlpi_fd()\fR function returns the integer file descriptor that can be used to directly operate on the open \fBDLPI\fR stream associated with the \fBDLPI\fR handle \fIdh\fR. This file descriptor can be used to perform non-\fBDLPI\fR operations that do not alter the state of the \fBDLPI\fR stream, such as waiting for an event using \fBpoll\fR(2), or pushing and configuring additional \fBSTREAMS\fR modules, such as \fBpfmod\fR(7M). If \fBDLPI\fR operations are directly performed on the file descriptor, or a \fBSTREAMS\fR module is pushed that alters the message-passing interface such that \fBDLPI\fR operations can no longer be issued, future operations on \fIdh\fR might not behave as documented.
.sp
.LP
The returned file descriptor is managed by \fBlibdlpi\fR(3LIB) and the descriptor must not be closed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The function returns the integer file descriptor associated with the \fBDLPI\fR handle \fIdh\fR. If \fIdh\fR is invalid, \fB-1\fR is returned.
