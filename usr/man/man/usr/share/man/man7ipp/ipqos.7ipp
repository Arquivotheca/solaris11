.SH NAME
ipqos \- IP Quality of Service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBipqos\fR is an implementation of the Differentiated Services model defined in \fIRFC2475: An Architecture for Differentiated Services\fR, which defines the following entities: multi-field classifier, meter, marker, and dropper. The Solaris implementation of \fBipqos\fR adds a flow accounting entity. 
.sp
.LP
These entities can be combined into processing paths that constitute a series of actions that are performed on groups of flows. The classifier groups together flows and directs them in a given processing path. Classifier configuration and path construction are achieved using the \fBipqosconf\fR(1M) command.
.sp
.LP
A summary of the \fBipqos\fR entities follows. For more information, refer to the corresponding man page for each entity.

\fBipgpc\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
An implementation of the classifier defined in the model. \fBipgpc\fR has been extended and is able to select traffic based on IP header parameters, user id, project id, interface name, interface group and direction.

\fBtokenmt, tswtclmt\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
These modules implement different metering algorithms. \fBtokenmt\fR implements both \fIRFC2697: A Single Rate Three Color Marker \fR and \fIRFC 2698: A Two Rate Three Color Marker\fR. \fItswtclmt\fR implements \fIRFC2859: A Time Sliding Window Three Color Marker\fR. These modules only implement the metering functions defined in the RFCs.

\fBdlcosmk\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A marker entity that allows the setting of the user priority field of Ethernet frames as defined in the \fIIEEE 802.1D\fR specification. \fBdlcosmk\fR is only available with VLAN capable       network interfaces.
.RE

.sp

\fBdscpmk\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A marker entity that enables the setting of the Differentiated Services Code Point Value in the IP header as defined in \fIRFC 2474: Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field)\fR in the IPv4 and IPv6 headers.

\fBflowacct\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
An accounting module that utilizes the Solaris extended accounting facility. \fBflowacct\fR logs all flows with parameters used to build a charge back mechanism.

.SH STATISTICS
.sp
.LP
\fBipqos\fR modules export statistics through the \fBkstat\fR facility. Exported statistics contain the following common parameters: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmodule\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
module name
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBinstance\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
dynamic parameter identifying a specific instance
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBname\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
a string  for global statistics (for example, ipgpc global stat) or a class name for per-class statistics for a classifier action
.RE

.sp
.LP
To verify classifier configuration, generate traffic for each of the configured classes and check that the statistic counters for the expected class are increased. If you're unsure about the parameters for your traffic, you can use \fBsnoop\fR(1M) to determine them. 
.sp
.LP
Some actions have the instance id of the next configured action in their statistics. This instance id can be used to follow the action processing path. Instance id's -1 and -2 are the built-in actions continue and drop, respectively. 
.sp
.LP
Examples:
.sp
.LP
To retrieve all statistics for ipgpc:
.sp
.LP
 \fBkstat -m ipgpc\fR
.sp
.LP
To retrieve statistics for the class http:
.sp
.LP
 \fBkstat -m ipgpc -c http\fR
