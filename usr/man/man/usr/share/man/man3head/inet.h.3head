.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBarpa/inet.h\fR> header defines the type \fBin_port_t\fR, the type \fBin_addr_t\fR, and the \fBin_addr\fR structure, as described in \fBin.h\fR(3HEAD). 
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBarpa/inet.h\fR> header may also make visible all symbols from \fBin.h\fR(3HEAD).

The following are declared as functions, and may also be defined as macros:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
in_addr_t       inet_addr(const char *);
in_addr_t       inet_lnaof(struct in_addr);
struct in_addr  inet_makeaddr(in_addr_t, in_addr_t);
in_addr_t       inet_netof(struct in_addr);
in_addr_t       inet_network(const char *);
char            *inet_ntoa(struct in_addr); 
.fi

.LP
For applications that do not require standard-conforming behavior (those that use the socket interfaces described in section 3N of the reference manual; see \fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the following may be declared as functions, or defined as macros, or both:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uint32_t    htonl(uint32_t);
uint16_t    htons(uint16_t);
uint32_t    ntohl(uint32_t);
uint16_t    ntohs(uint16_t);
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Standard conforming"

.LP
For applications that require standard-conforming behavior (those that use the socket interfaces described in section 3XN of the reference manual; see \fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the following may be declared as functions, or defined as macros, or both:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
in_addr_t    htonl(in_addr_t);
in_port_t    htons(in_port_t);
