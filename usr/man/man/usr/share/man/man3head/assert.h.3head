.TH assert.h 3HEAD "10 Sep 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Headers"
.SH NAME
assert.h, assert \- verify program assertion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBassert.h\fR> 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBassert.h\fR> header defines the \fBassert()\fR macro. It refers to the macro \fBNDEBUG\fR which is not defined in the header. If \fBNDEBUG\fR is defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header, the \fBassert()\fR macro is defined simply as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in \fBassert\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The \fBassert()\fR macro is redefined according to the current state of \fBNDEBUG\fR each time <\fBassert.h\fR> is included.
.sp
.LP
The \fBassert()\fR macro is implemented as a macro, not as a function. If the macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function, the behavior is undefined.
