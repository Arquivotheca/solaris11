.SH NAME
stddef.h, stddef \- standard type definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBstddef.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBstddef.h\fR> header defines the following macros:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNULL\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Null pointer constant.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBoffsetof(type, member-designator)\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Integer constant expression of type \fBsize_t\fR, the value of which is the offset in bytes to the structure member (\fBmember-designator\fR), from the beginning of its structure (\fBtype\fR).
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBstddef.h\fR> header defines the following types:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBptrdiff_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBwchar_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct wide-character codes for all members of the largest character set specified among the locales supported by the compilation environment: the null character has the code value 0 and each member of the portable character set has a code value equal to its value when used as the lone character in an integer character constant.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsize_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Unsigned integer type of the result of the \fBsizeof\fR operator.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the widths of \fBptrdiff_t\fR, \fBsize_t\fR, and \fBwchar_t\fR are no greater than the width of type \fBlong\fR. The names of these programming environments can be obtained using the \fBconfstr\fR(3C) function or the \fBgetconf\fR(1) utility.
