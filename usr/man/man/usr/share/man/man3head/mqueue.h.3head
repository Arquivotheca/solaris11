.TH mqueue.h 3HEAD "30 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Headers"
.SH NAME
mqueue.h, mqueue \- message queues
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <mqueue.h>\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB<mqueue.h>\fR header defines the \fBmqd_t\fR type, which is used for message queue descriptors.  This will not be an array type.  A message queue descriptor may be implemented using a file descriptor, in which case applications can open up to at least \fBOPEN_MAX\fR file and message queues.
.sp
.LP
The \fB<mqueue.h>\fR header defines the \fBsigevent\fR structure (as described in <\fBsignal.h\fR>, see \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD)) and the  \fBmq_attr\fR structure, which is used in getting and setting the attributes of a message queue.  Attributes are initially set when the message queue is created.  A \fBmq_attr\fR structure has the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
long    mq_flags       message queue flags
long    mq_maxmsg      maximum number of messages
long    mq_msgsize     maximum message size
long    mq_curmsgs     number of messages currently queued
.fi
.in -2

Inclusion of the \fB<mqueue.h>\fR header may make visible symbols defined in the headers \fB<fcntl.h>\fR, \fB<signal.h>\fR, \fB<sys/types.h>\fR, and \fB<time.h>\fR.
