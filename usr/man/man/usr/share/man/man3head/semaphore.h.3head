.nf
#include <\fBsemaphore.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsemaphore.h\fR> header defines the \fBsem_t\fR type, used in performing semaphore operations. The semaphore can be implemented using a file descriptor, in which case applications are able to open up at least a total of {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR} files and semaphores. The symbol \fBSEM_FAILED\fR is defined (see \fBsem_open\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBsemaphore.h\fR> header can make visible symbols defined in the headers <\fBfcntl.h\fR> and <\fBsys/types.h\fR>. See \fBfcntl.h\fR(3HEAD) and \fBtypes.h\fR(3HEAD).
