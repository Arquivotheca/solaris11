.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that is used to store addresses for the Internet protocol family.  Values of this type must be cast to \fBstruct sockaddr\fR for use with the socket interfaces.
.SS "Default"
.sp
.LP
For applications that do not require standard-conforming behavior (those that use the socket interfaces described in section (3SOCKET) of the reference manual; see \fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sa_family_t     sin_family
in_port_t       sin_port
struct in_addr  sin_addr
char            sin_zero[8]
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Standard conforming"
.sp
.LP
For applications that require standard-conforming behavior (those that use the socket interfaces described in section (3XNET) of the reference manual; see \fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
