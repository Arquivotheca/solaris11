.SH NAME
wordexp.h, wordexp \- word-expansion types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBwordexp.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBwordexp.h\fR> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used by the \fBwordexp()\fR and \fBwordfree()\fR functions. See \fBwordexp\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The structure type \fBwordexp_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
size_t we_wordc        /* count of words matched by words */
char   **we_wordv      /* pointer to list of expanded words */
size_t we_offs         /* slots to reserve at the beginning 
                          of we_wordv */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIflags\fR argument to the \fBwordexp()\fR function is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_APPEND\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Append words to those previously generated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_DOOFFS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Number of null pointers to prepend to \fBwe_wordv\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_NOCMD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Fail if command substitution is requested.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_REUSE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
The \fBpwordexp\fR argument was passed to a previous successful call to \fBwordexp()\fR, and has not been passed to \fBwordfree()\fR. The result is the same as if the application had called \fBwordfree()\fR and then called \fBwordexp()\fR without \fBWRDE_REUSE\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_SHOWERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Do not redirect \fBstderr\fR to \fB/dev/null\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWRDE_UNDEF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell variable.
.RE

.LP
The following constants are defined as error return values:
.sp
.ne 2

.ad
.RS 16n
.rt

\fB\fBWRDE_BADVAL\fR\fR

.ad
.RS 16n
