.SH NAME
poll.h, poll \- definitions for the \fBpoll()\fR function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBpoll.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBpoll.h\fR> header defines the \fBpollfd\fR structure, which includes the following members:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBint fd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
the following descriptor being polled
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBshort events\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
the input event flags (see below)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBshort revents\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
the output event flags (see below)
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBpoll.h\fR> header defines the following type through \fBtypedef\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnfds_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
an unsigned integer type used for the number of file descriptors
.RE

.sp
.LP
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the width of \fBnfds_t\fR is no greater than the width of type long. The names of these programming environments can be obtained using the \fBconfstr()\fR function or the \fBgetconf\fR utility. See \fBconfstr\fR(3C) and \fBgetconf\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
The following symbolic constants are defined, zero or more of which can be OR'ed together to form the \fBevents\fR or \fBrevents\fR members  in the \fBpollfd\fR structure:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOLLIN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Data other than high-priority data can be read without blocking.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na

.rt  
Normal data can be read without blocking.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOLLRDBAND\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Priority data can be read without blocking.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
