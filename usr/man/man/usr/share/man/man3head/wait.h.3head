.SH NAME
wait.h, wait \- wait status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <sys/wait.h>\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When a process waits for status from its children using either the \fBwait\fR(3C) or \fBwaitpid\fR(3C) function, the status returned can be evaluated with the following macros, defined in <\fBsys/wait.h\fR>. These macros evaluate to integral expressions. The \fIstat\fR argument to these macros is the integer value returned from \fBwait()\fR or \fBwaitpid()\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWCOREDUMP\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
If the value of \fBWIFSIGNALED\fR (\fIstat\fR) is non-zero, this macro evaluates to a non-zero value if a core image of the terminated child was created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWEXITSTATUS\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
If the value of  \fBWIFEXITED(\fR\fIstat\fR\fB)\fR is non-zero, this macro evaluates to the exit code that the child process passed to  \fB_exit()\fR (see \fBexit\fR(2)) or \fBexit\fR(3C), or the value that the child process returned from \fBmain\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWIFCONTINUED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that has continued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWIFEXITED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that terminated normally.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWIFSIGNALED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that terminated due to the receipt of a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWIFSTOPPED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that is currently stopped.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWSTOPSIG\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
If the value of \fBWIFSTOPPED(\fR\fIstat\fR\fB)\fR is non-zero, this macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the child process to stop.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWTERMSIG\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
If the value of  \fBWIFSIGNALED\fR(\fIstat\fR) is non-zero, this macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the termination of the child process.
