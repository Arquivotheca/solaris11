.LP
The structure type \fBglob_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
size_t gl_pathc       /* count of paths matched by pattern */
char   **gl_pathv     /* pointer to a list of matched 
                         pathnames */
size_t gl_offs        /* lots to reserve at the beginning 
                         of gl_pathv */
.fi
.in -2

.sp

The following constants are provided as values for the \fBflags\fR argument:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_APPEND\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOCHECK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If pattern does not match any  pathname, then return a list consisting of only pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
