.TH sched.h 3HEAD "1 Apr 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Headers"
.SH NAME
sched.h, sched \- execution scheduling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <sched.h>\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsched.h\fR> header defines the \fBsched_param\fR structure, which contains the scheduling parameters required for implementation of each supported scheduling policy. This structure contains the following member:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int    sched_priority    process execution scheduling priority
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Each process is controlled by an associated scheduling policy and priority. Associated with each policy is a priority range.  Each policy definition specifies the minimum priority range for that policy. The priority ranges for each policy may overlap the priority ranges of other policies.
.sp
.LP
The scheduling policies are indicated by the values of the following symbolic constants:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_OTHER\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled according to the traditional Time-Sharing Class (TS) policy as described in \fBpriocntl\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_FIFO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled in the Real-Time (RT) scheduling class, according to the First-In-First-Out  (FIFO) policy. Processes scheduled to this policy, if not preempted by a higher priority or interrupted by a signal, will proceed until completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_RR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled in the Real-Time (RT) scheduling class, according to the Round-Robin (RR) policy. Processes scheduled to this policy, if not preempted by a higher priority or interrupted by a signal, will execute for a time period, returned by \fBsched_rr_get_interval\fR(3C) or by the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_IA\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled according to the Inter-Active Class (IA) policy as described in \fBpriocntl\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_FSS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled according to the Fair-Share Class (FSS) policy as described in \fBpriocntl\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSCHED_FX\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Processes are scheduled according to the Fixed-Priority Class (FX) policy as described in \fBpriocntl\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.LP
The values of these constants are distinct.
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the \fB<sched.h>\fR header will make visible symbols defined in the header \fB<time.h>\fR.
