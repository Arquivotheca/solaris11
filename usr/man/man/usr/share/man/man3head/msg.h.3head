#include <\fBsys/msg.h\fR> 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsys/msg.h\fR> header defines the following data types through \fBtypedef\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBmsgqnum_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
used for the number of messages in the message queue
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBmsglen_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
used for the number of bytes allowed in the message queue
.RE

.sp
.LP
These types are unsigned integer types that are able to store values at least as large as a type unsigned short.

.LP
The <\fBsys/msg.h\fR> header defines the following constant as a message operation flag:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMSG_NOERROR\fR\fR
