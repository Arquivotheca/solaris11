.SH DESCRIPTION

Files produced as a result of calling \fBacct\fR(2) have records in the form defined by <\fBsys/acct.h\fR>, whose contents are:

In \fBac_flag\fR, the \fBAFORK\fR flag is turned on by each \fBfork\fR and turned off by an \fBexec\fR. The \fBac_comm\fR field is inherited from the parent process and is reset by any \fBexec\fR. Each time the system charges the process with a clock tick, it also adds to \fBac_mem\fR the current process size, computed as follows:
.sp
.LP
\fI(data size) + (text size) / (number of in-core processes using text)\fR
.sp
.LP
The value of \fBac_mem\|/\|(ac_stime\|+\|ac_utime)\fR can be viewed as an approximation to the mean process size, as modified by text sharing.
.sp
.LP
The structure \fBtacct\fR, (which resides with the source files of the accounting commands), represents a summary of accounting statistics for the user id \fBta_uid\fR. This structure is used by the accounting commands to report  statistics based on user id.

                                     p/np */

   unsigned short  ta_sc;        /* count of login sessions */

The \fBta_cpu\fR, \fBta_kcore\fR, and \fBta_con\fR members contain usage information pertaining to prime time and non-prime time hours.  The first element in each array represents the time the  resource was used during prime time hours.  The second element in  each array represents the time the resource was used during non-prime time hours.  Prime time and non-prime time hours may be set in the  \fBholidays\fR file (see \fBholidays\fR(4)).
.sp
.LP
The \fBta_kcore\fR member is a cumulative measure of the amount of memory used  over the accounting period by processes owned by the user with uid \fBta_uid\fR. The amount shown represents kilobyte segments of memory used, per minute.
.sp
.LP
The \fBta_con\fR member represents the amount of time the user was logged in to the system.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBac_mem\fR value for a short-lived command gives little information about the actual size of the command, because \fBac_mem\fR may be incremented while a different command (for example, the shell) is being executed by the process.
