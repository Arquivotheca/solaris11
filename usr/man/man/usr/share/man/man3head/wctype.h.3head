.TH wctype.h 3HEAD "10 Sep 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Headers"
.SH NAME
wctype.h, wctype \- wide-character classification and mapping utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBwctype.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBwctype.h\fR> header defines the following types:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBwint_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
As described in <\fBwchar.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBwctrans_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
A scalar type that can hold values that represent locale-specific character mappings.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBwctype_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
As described in <\fBwchar.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBwctype.h\fR> header defines the following macro name:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBWEOF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
Constant expression of type \fBwint_t\fR that is returned by several MSE functions to indicate end-of-file.
.RE

.sp
.LP
For all functions described in this header that accept an argument of type \fBwint_t\fR, the value is representable as a \fBwchar _t\fR or equals the value of \fBWEOF\fR. If this argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of these functions is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale.
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBwctype.h\fR> header can make visible all symbols from the headers <\fBctype.h\fR>, <\fBstdarg.h\fR>, <\fBstddef.h\fR>, <\fBstdio.h\fR>, <\fBstdlib.h\fR>, <\fBstring.h\fR>, <\fBtime.h\fR>, and <\fBwchar.h\fR>.
