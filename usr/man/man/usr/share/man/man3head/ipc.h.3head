.SH NAME
ipc.h, ipc \- XSI interprocess communication access structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBsys/ipc.h\fR> 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsys/ipc.h\fR> header is used by three mechanisms for interprocess communication (IPC): messages, semaphores, and shared memory. All use a common structure type, \fBipc_perm\fR, to pass information used in determining permission to perform an IPC operation.
.sp
.LP
The \fBipc_perm\fR structure contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uid_t  uid     /* owner's user ID */
gid_t  gid     /* owner's group ID */
uid_t  cuid    /* creator's user ID */
gid_t  cgid    /* creator's group ID */
mode_t mode    /* read/write permission
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBuid_t\fR, \fBgid_t\fR, \fBmode_t\fR, and \fBkey_t\fR types are defined as described in <\fBsys/types.h\fR>. See \fBtypes.h\fR(3HEAD).
