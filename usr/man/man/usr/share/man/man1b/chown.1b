.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/chown\fR [\fB-fR\fR] \fIowner\fR[.group] \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBchown\fR changes the owner of the \fIfilename\fRs to \fIowner\fR. The owner can be either a decimal user \fBID\fR (\fBUID\fR) or a login name found in the password file. An optional \fIgroup\fR can also be specified. The group can be either a decimal group \fBID\fR (\fBGID\fR) or a group name found in the \fBGID\fR file.
.sp
.LP
In the default case, only the super-user of the machine where  the file is physically located can change the owner. The system configuration option \fB{_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED}\fR and the privileges \fBPRIV_FILE_CHOWN\fR and \fBPRIV_FILE_CHOWN_SELF\fR also affect who can change the ownership of a file. See \fBchown\fR(2) and \fBprivileges\fR(5).
