.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlogger\fR utility provides a method for adding one-line entries to the system log file from the command line. One or more \fImessage\fR arguments can be given on the command line, in which case each is logged immediately. If \fImessage\fR is unspecified, either the file indicated with \fB-f\fR or the standard input is added to the log. Otherwise, a \fIfilename\fR can be specified, in which case each line in the file is logged. If neither is specified, \fBlogger\fR reads and logs messages on a line-by-line basis from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad

\fB\fB-p\fR \fIpriority\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Enter the message with the specified \fIpriority\fR. The message priority can be specified numerically, or as a \fIfacility.level\fR pair. For example, \fB`\fR\fB-p\fR \fBlocal3.info'\fR assigns the message priority to the \fBinfo\fR level in the \fBlocal3\fR facility. The default priority is \fBuser.notice\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRLogging a message
.sp
.LP
The command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBlogger System rebooted\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
will log the message `\fBSystem rebooted\fR' to the facility at priority \fBnotice\fR to be treated by \fBsyslogd\fR as other messages to the facility \fBnotice\fR are.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRLogging messages from a file
.sp
.LP
The command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBlogger \fR\fB-p\fR\fB local0.notice \fR\fB-t\fR\fB HOSTIDM \fR\fB-f\fR\fB /dev/idmc\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
will read from the file \fB/dev/idmc\fR and will log each line in that file as a message with the tag `\fBHOSTIDM\fR' at priority \fBnotice\fR to be treated by \fBsyslogd\fR as other messages to the facility \fBlocal0\fR are.
