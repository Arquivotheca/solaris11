.SH NAME
file \- determine the type of a file by examining its contents
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfile\fR performs a series of tests on each  \fIfilename\fR in an attempt to determine what it contains. If the contents of a file appear to be  \fBASCII\fR text, \fBfile\fR examines the first 512 bytes and tries to guess its language.
.sp
.LP
\fBfile\fR uses the file \fB/etc/magic\fR to identify files that have some sort of \fImagic number\fR, that is, any file containing a numeric or string constant that indicates its type.

Check for format errors in the magic number file. For reasons of efficiency, this validation is not normally carried out. No file type-checking is done under \fB-c\fR.

This example illustrates the use of \fBfile\fR on all the files in a specific user's directory:

code:           mc68020 demand paged executable
code.c:         c program text
counts:         ascii text
doc:            roff,nroff, or eqn input text

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
The environment variables \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLANG\fR, and \fBLC_default\fR control the character classification throughout \fBfile\fR. On entry to \fBfile\fR, these environment variables are checked in the following order: \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLANG\fR, and \fBLC_default\fR. When a valid value is found, remaining environment variables for character classification are ignored. For example, a new setting for \fBLANG\fR does not override the current valid character classification rules of \fBLC_CTYPE\fR. When none of the values is valid, the shell character classification defaults to the   POSIX.1 "C"  locale.
