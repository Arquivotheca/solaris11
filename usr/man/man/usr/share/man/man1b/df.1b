.SH NAME
df \- display status of disk space on file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/df\fR [\fB-a\fR] [\fB-i\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fItype\fR] [\fIfilesystem...\fR] 
     [\fIfilename...\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdf\fR utility displays the amount of disk space occupied by currently mounted file systems, the amount of used and available space, and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used.
.sp
.LP
If arguments to \fBdf\fR are path names, \fBdf\fR produces a report on the file system containing the named file. Thus `\fBdf  .\fR' shows the amount of space on the file system containing the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Report on all filesystems including the uninteresting ones which have zero total blocks (that is, auto-mounter).
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBdf\fR
.sp
.LP
A sample of output for \fBdf\fR looks like:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBdf\fR
Filesystem   kbytes  used  avail  capacity  Mounted on
sparky:/       7445  4714  1986     70%     /
sparky:/usr   42277 35291  2758     93%     /usr
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that \fBused\fR+\fBavail\fR is less than the amount of space in the file system (kbytes); this is because the system reserves a fraction of the space in the file system to allow its file system allocation routines to work well. The amount reserved is typically about 10%; this can be adjusted using \fBtunefs\fR (see \fBtunefs\fR(1M)). When all the space on a file system except for this reserve is in use, only the super-user can allocate new files and data blocks to existing files. When a file system is overallocated in this way, \fBdf\fR can report that the file system is more than 100% utilized.
