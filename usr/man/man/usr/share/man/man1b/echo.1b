.SH NAME
echo \- echo arguments to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/echo\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fIargument\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBecho\fR writes its arguments, separated by \fIBLANK\fRs and terminated by a \fINEWLINE\fR, to the standard output.
.sp
.LP
\fBecho\fR is useful for producing diagnostics in command files and for sending known data into a pipe, and for displaying the contents of environment variables.
.sp
.LP
For example, you can use \fBecho\fR to determine how many subdirectories below the root directory (\fB/\fR) is your current directory, as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
echo your current-working-directory's full pathname
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
pipe the output through \fBtr\fR to translate the path's embedded slash-characters into space-characters
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
pipe that output through \fBwc\fR \fB-w\fR for a count of the names in your path.

See \fBtr\fR(1) and \fBwc\fR(1) for their functionality.
.sp
.LP
The shells \fBcsh\fR(1), \fBksh\fR(1), and \fBsh\fR(1), each have an \fBecho\fR built-in command, which, by default, will have precedence, and will be invoked if the user calls \fBecho\fR without a full pathname. \fB/usr/ucb/echo\fR and \fBcsh\fR's \fBecho()\fR have an \fB-n\fR option, but do not understand back-slashed escape characters. \fBsh\fR's \fBecho()\fR, \fBksh\fR's \fBecho()\fR, and \fB/usr/bin/echo\fR, on the other hand, understand the black-slashed escape characters, and \fBksh\fR's \fBecho()\fR also understands \fB\ea\fR as the audible bell character; however, these commands do not have an \fB-n\fR option.
