.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBps\fR command displays information about processes. Normally, only those processes that are running with your effective user \fBID\fR and are attached to a controlling terminal (see  \fBtermio\fR(7I)) are shown. Additional categories of processes can be added to the display using various options. In particular, the \fB-a\fR option allows you to include processes that are not owned by you (that do not have your user \fBID\fR), and the \fB-x\fR option allows you to include processes without controlling terminals. When you specify both \fB-a\fR and \fB-x\fR, you get processes owned by anyone, with or without a controlling terminal. The \fB-r\fR option restricts the list of processes printed to running and runnable processes.
.sp
.LP
\fBps\fR displays in tabular form the process ID, under \fBPID\fR; the controlling terminal (if any), under \fBTT\fR; the cpu time used by the process so far, including both user and system time, under \fBTIME\fR; the state of the process, under S; and finally, an indication of the \fBCOMMAND\fR that is running.
.sp
.LP
The state is given by a single letter from the following:

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options must all be combined to form the first argument. The \fBps\fR command accepts the arguments without the leading (\fB-\fR) for  historical reasons
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Includes information about processes owned by others.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Displays the command name rather than the command arguments.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Displays the environment as well as the arguments to the command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Displays all processes. Without this option, \fBps\fR only prints interesting processes. Processes are deemed to be uninteresting if they are process group leaders. This normally eliminates top-level command interpreters and processes waiting for users to login on free terminals.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Displays a long listing, with fields \fBF\fR, \fBPPID\fR, \fBCP\fR, \fBPRI\fR, \fBNI\fR, \fBSZ\fR, \fBRSS\fR, and \fBWCHAN\fR as described below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-n\fR\fR

.RS 11n

\fB\fB-t\fR \fIterm\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lists only process data associated with the terminal, \fIterm\fR. Terminal identifiers may be specified in one of two forms:  the device's file name (for example,  \fBtty04\fR or \fBterm/14\fR ) or, if the device's file name starts with  \fBtty\fR, just the digit identifier (for example, \fB04\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-u\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Obsolete. This option no longer has any effect. It causes \fBps\fR to exit without printing the process listing.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Uses a wide output format, that is, 132 columns rather than 80. If the option letter is repeated, that is, \fB-ww\fR, this option uses arbitrarily wide output. This information is used to decide how much of long commands to print. \fBNote:\fR The wide output option can be viewed only by a superuser or the user who owns the process.
.RE

.SH NOTES

.LP
Things can change while \fBps\fR is running. The picture \fBps\fR gives is only a close approximation to the current state. Some data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant.
