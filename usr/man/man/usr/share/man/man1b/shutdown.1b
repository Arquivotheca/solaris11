.SH NAME
shutdown \- close down the system at a given time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/shutdown\fR [\fB-fhknr\fR] \fItime\fR [\fIwarning-message\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBshutdown\fR provides an automated procedure to notify users when the system is to be shut down. \fBtime\fR specifies when \fBshutdown\fR will bring the system down; it may be the word \fBnow\fR (indicating an immediate shutdown), or it may specify a future time in one of two formats: \fB+\fR\fInumber\fR and \fIhour\fR\fB:\fR\fImin.\fR The first form brings the system down in \fInumber\fR minutes, and the second brings the system down at the time of day indicated in 24-hour notation.
.sp
.LP
At intervals that get closer as the apocalypse approaches, warning messages are displayed at terminals of all logged-in users, and of users who have remote mounts on that machine.
.sp
.LP
At shutdown time a message is written to the system log daemon, \fBsyslogd\fR(1M), containing the time of shutdown, the instigator of the shutdown, and the reason. Then a terminate signal is sent to \fBinit\fR, which brings the system down to single-user mode.
