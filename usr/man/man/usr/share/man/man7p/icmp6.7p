.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBICMP6\fR protocol is the error and control message protocol used with Version 6 of the Internet Protocol. It is used by the kernel to handle and report errors in protocol processing. It is also used for \fBIPv6\fR neighbor and router discovery, and for multicast group membership queries and reports. It may also be accessed by programs using the socket interface or the Transport Level Interface (\fBTLI\fR) for network monitoring and diagnostic functions. When used with the socket interface, a "raw socket" type is used. The protocol number for \fBICMP6\fR, used in the \fIproto\fR parameter to the socket call, can be obtained from \fBgetprotobyname\fR(3SOCKET). \fBICMP6\fR file descriptors and sockets are connectionless and are normally used with the \fBt_sndudata\fR / \fBt_rcvudata\fR and the \fBsendto()\fR / \fBrecvfrom()\fR calls. They may also be used with the \fBsendmsg()\fR/\fBrecvgmsg()\fR calls when sending or receiving ancillary data.
.sp
.LP
Outgoing packets automatically have an Internet Protocol Version 6 (\fBIPv6\fR) header and zero or more \fBIPv6\fR extension headers prepended. These headers are prepended by the kernel. Unlike \fBICMP\fR for \fBIPv4\fR, the \fBIP_HDRINCL\fR option is not supported for \fBICMP6\fR, so \fBICMP6\fR applications neither build their own outbound \fBIPv6\fR headers, nor do they receive the inbound \fBIPv6\fR headers with received data. \fBIPv6\fR extension headers and relevant fields of the \fBIPv6\fR header may be set or received as ancillary data to a \fBsendmsg\fR(3SOCKET) or \fBrecvmsg\fR(3SOCKET) system call. Each of these fields and extension headers may also be set on a per socket basis with the \fBsetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET) system call. Such "sticky" options are used on all outgoing packets unless overridden by ancillary data. When any ancillary data is present with a \fBsendmsg\fR(3SOCKET) system call, all sticky options are ignored for that system call, but subsequently remain configured.
.sp
.LP
\fBICMP6\fR is a datagram protocol layered above \fBIPv6\fR. Received \fBICMP6\fR messages may be reflected back to users of higher-level protocols such as \fBTCP\fR or \fBUDP\fR as error returns from system calls. A copy of each \fBICMP6\fRerror message received by the system is provided to every holder of an open \fBICMP6\fR socket or \fBTLI\fR descriptor.
