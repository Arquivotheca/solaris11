.SH NAME
net_inject_t \- structure for describing how to transmit a packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/neti.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_inject_t\fR data structure passes information in to \fBnet_inject\fR about how to transmit a packet. Transmit includes sending the packet up into the system as well as out of it.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.sp

.nf
 mblk_t                  *ni_packet;   /* start of the packet */
  struct sockaddr_storage ni_addr;      /* address of next hop */
  phy_if_t                ni_physical;  /* network interface to use */

This field is only required to be initialized if \fBNI_DIRECT_OUT\fR is being used to transmit the packet. The \fBsockaddr_storage\fR field must be set to indicate whether the destination address contained in the structure is \fBIPv4\fR (cast \fIni_addr\fR to struct \fIsockaddr_in\fR) or \fBIPv6\fR (cast \fIni_addr\fR to struct \fIsockaddr_in6\fR).
