.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A \fBddi_fm_error_t\fR structure contains common data necessary for \fBI/O\fR error handling. A pointer to a \fBddi_fm_error_t\fR structure is passed to error handling callbacks where it can then be used in a call to \fBpci_ereport_post()\fR. The same structure is also returned to callers of \fBddi_fm_acc_err_get()\fR and \fBddi_fm_dma_err_get()\fR.

The \fBfme_version\fR is the current version of \fBddi_fm_error_t\fR. Valid values for the version are: \fBDDI_FME_VER0\fR and \fBDDI_FME_VER1\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfme_ena\fR is the \fBFMA\fR event protocol Format 1 Error Numeric Association (\fBENA\fR) for this error condition.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfme_flag\fR field is set to \fBDDI_FM_ERR_EXPECTED\fR if the error is the result of a \fBDDI_ACC_CAUTIOUS\fR protected operation. In this case, \fBfme_acc_handle\fR is valid and the driver should check for and report only errors not associated with the \fBDDI_ACC_CAUTIOUS\fR protected access operation. This field can also be set to \fBDDI_FM_ERR_POKE\fR or \fBDDI_FM_ERR_PEEK\fR if the error is the result of a \fBddi_peek\fR(9F) or \fBddi_poke\fR(9F) operation. The driver should handle these in a similar way to \fBDDI_FM_ERR_EXPECTED\fR. Otherwise, \fBddi_flag\fR is set to \fBDDI_FM_ERR_UNEXPECTED\fR and the driver must perform the full range of error handling tasks.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfme_status\fR indicates current status of an error handler callback or resource handle:
