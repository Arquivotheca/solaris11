.SH NAME
scsi_status \- SCSI status structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h> 
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBSCSI-2\fRstandard defines a status byte that is normally sent by the target to the initiator during the status phase at the completion of each command.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uchar  sts_scsi2    :1;       /* SCSI-2 modifier bit */
uchar  sts_is       :1;       /* intermediate status sent */
uchar  sts_busy     :1;       /* device busy or reserved */
uchar  sts_cm       :1;       /* condition met */
ucha   sts_chk      :1;       /* check condition */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
\fBsts_chk\fR indicates that a contingent allegiance condition has occurred.
.sp
.LP
\fBsts_cm\fR is returned whenever the requested operation is satisfied
.sp
.LP
\fBsts_busy\fR indicates that the target is busy. This status is returned whenever a target is unable to accept a command from an otherwise acceptable initiator (that is, no reservation conflicts). The recommended initiator recovery action is to issue the command again later.
.sp
.LP
\fBsts_is\fR is returned for every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands (except the last command), unless the command is terminated with a check condition status, reservation conflict, or command terminated status. Note that host bus adapter drivers may not support linked commands (see \fBscsi_ifsetcap\fR(9F)). If \fBsts_is\fR and \fBsts_busy\fR are both set, then a reservation conflict has occurred.
.sp
.LP
\fBsts_scsi2\fR is the \fBSCSI-2 \fRmodifier bit. If \fBsts_scsi2\fR and \fBsts_chk\fR are both set, this indicates a command terminated status. If \fBsts_scsi2\fR and \fBsts_busy\fR are both set, this indicates that the command queue in the target is full.
.sp
.LP
For accessing the status as a byte, the following values are appropriate:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_GOOD\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status indicates that the target has successfully completed the command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_CHECK\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status indicates that a contingent allegiance condition has occurred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_MET\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is returned when the requested operations are satisfied.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_BUSY\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status indicates that the target is busy.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_INTERMEDIATE\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is returned for every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_SCSI2\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This is the \fBSCSI-2 \fRmodifier bit.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_INTERMEDIATE_MET\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is a combination of \fBSTATUS_MET\fR and \fBSTATUS_INTERMEDIATE\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_RESERVATION_CONFLICT\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is a combination of \fBSTATUS_INTERMEDIATE\fR and \fBSTATUS_BUSY\fR, and it is returned whenever an initiator attempts to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit is reserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_TERMINATED\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is a combination of \fBSTATUS_SCSI2\fR and \fBSTATUS_CHECK,\fR and it is returned whenever the target terminates the current \fBI/O\fR process after receiving a terminate \fBI/O\fR process message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATUS_QFULL\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This status is a combination of \fBSTATUS_SCSI2\fR and \fBSTATUS_BUSY\fR, and it is returned when the command queue in the target is full.
