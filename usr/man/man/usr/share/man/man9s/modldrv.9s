.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBmodldrv\fR structure is used by device drivers to export driver specific information to the kernel.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS

struct mod_ops    *drv_modops;     
char              *drv_linkinfo; 
struct dev_ops    *drv_dev_ops;

\fB\fBdrv_modops\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Must always be initialized to the address of \fBmod_driverops\fR. This member identifies the module as a loadable driver.
