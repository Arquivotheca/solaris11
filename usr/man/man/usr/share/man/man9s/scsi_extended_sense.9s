.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_extended_sense\fR structure for error codes \fB0x70\fR (current errors) and \fB0x71\fR (deferred errors) is returned on a successful \fBREQUEST SENSE\fR command. \fBSCSI-2 \fRcompliant targets are required to return at least the first 18 bytes of this structure. This structure is part of  \fBscsi_device\fR(9S) structure.
