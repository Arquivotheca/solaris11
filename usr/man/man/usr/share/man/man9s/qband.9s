.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
All access to this structure should be through \fBstrqget\fR(9F) and \fBstrqset\fR(9F). It is logically part of the \fBqueue\fR(9S) and its layout and partitioning with respect to that structure might change in future releases. If portability is a concern, do not declare or store instances of or references to this structure.
