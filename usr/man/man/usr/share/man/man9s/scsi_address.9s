.SH NAME
scsi_address \- SCSI address structure 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h> 
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris architecture specific (Solaris DDI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A \fBscsi_address\fR structure defines the addressing components for a \fBSCSI\fR target device. The address of the target device is separated into two components: target number and logical unit number. The two addressing components are used to uniquely identify any type of \fBSCSI\fR device; however, most devices can be addressed with the target component of the address.
.sp
.LP
In the case where only the target component is used to address the device, the logical unit should be set to  \fB0\fR. If the \fBSCSI\fR target device supports logical units, then the \fBHBA\fR must interpret the logical units field of the data structure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpkt_address\fR member of a \fBscsi_pkt\fR(9S) is initialized by \fBscsi_init_pkt\fR(9F).

\fBa_hba_tran\fR is a pointer to the controlling \fBHBA\fR's transport vector structure. The \fBSCSA\fR interface uses this field to pass any transport requests from the \fBSCSI\fR target device drivers to the \fBHBA\fR driver.
.sp
.LP
\fBa_target\fR is the target component of the \fBSCSI\fR address.
.sp
.LP
\fBa_lun\fR is the logical unit component of the \fBSCSI\fR address. The logical unit is used to further distinguish a \fBSCSI\fR target device that supports multiple logical units from one that does not. The \fBmakecom\fR(9F) family of functions use the \fBa_lun\fR field to set the logical unit field in the \fBSCSI\fR \fBCDB\fR, for compatibility with \fBSCSI-1\fR.
