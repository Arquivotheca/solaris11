.SH INTERFACE LEVEL

Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhook_pkt_event\fR structure contains fields that relate to a packet in a network protocol handler. This structure is passed through to a callback for \fBNH_PRE_ROUTING\fR, \fBNH_POST_ROUTING\fR, \fBNH_FORWARDING\fR, \fBNH_LOOPBACK_IN\fR and \fBNH_LOOPBACK_OUT\fR events.
.sp
.LP
A callback may only modify the \fBhpe_hdr\fR, \fBhpe_mp\fR and \fBhpe_mb\fR fields.
.sp
.LP
The following table documents which fields can be safely used as a result of each event.

The following fields are set for each event:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhne_family\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The protocol family for this packet. This value matches the corresponding value returned from a call to \fBnet_protocol_lookup\fR(9F).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_ifp\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The inbound interface for a packet.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_ofp\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The outbound interface for a packet.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_hdr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Pointer to the start of the network protocol header within an \fBmblk_t\fR structure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_mp\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Pointer to the \fBmblk_t\fR pointer that points to the first \fBmblk_t\fR structure in this packet.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_mb\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Pointer to the \fBmblk_t\fR structure that contains \fBhpe_hdr\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhpe_flags\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
This field is used to carry additional properties of packets. The current collection of defined bits available is:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBHPE_BROADCAST\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
This bit is set if the packet was recognized as a broadcast packet from the link layer. The bit cannot be set if \fBHPE_MULTICAST\fR is set, currently only possible with physical in packet events.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBHPE_MULTICAST\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
This set if the packet was recognized as a multicast packet from the link layer. This bit cannot be set if \fBHPE_BROADCAST\fR is set, currently only possible with physical in packet events.
