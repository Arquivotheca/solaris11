.SH NAME
scsi_device \- SCSI device structure 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_device\fR structure stores common information about each SCSI logical unit, including pointers to areas that contain both generic and device specific information. There is one \fBscsi_device\fR structure for each logical unit attached to the system. The host adapter driver initializes part of this structure prior to \fBprobe\fR(9E) and destroys this structure after a probe failure or successful \fBdetach\fR(9E).

.LP
\fBsd_address\fR contains the routing information that the target driver normally copies into a \fBscsi_pkt\fR(9S) structure using the collection of  \fBmakecom\fR(9F) functions. The \fBSCSA\fR library routines use this information to determine which host adapter, \fBSCSI\fR bus, and target/logical unit number (lun) a command is intended for. This structure is initialized by the host adapter driver.
.sp
.LP
\fBsd_dev\fR is a pointer to the corresponding \fBdev_info\fR structure. This pointer is initialized by the host adapter driver.
.sp
.LP
\fBsd_mutex\fR is a mutual exclusion lock for this device. It is used to serialize access to a device. The host adapter driver initializes this mutex. See \fBmutex\fR(9F). 
.sp
.LP
\fBsd_inq\fR is initially \fINULL\fR (zero). After executing \fBscsi_probe\fR(9F), this field contains the inquiry data associated with the particular device.
.sp
.LP
\fBsd_sense\fR is initially \fINULL\fR (zero). If the target driver wants to use this field for storing \fBREQUEST SENSE\fR data, it should allocate an  \fBscsi_extended_sense\fR(9S) buffer and set this field to the address of this buffer.
.sp
.LP
\fBsd_private\fR is reserved for the use of target drivers and should generally be used to point to target specific data structures.
