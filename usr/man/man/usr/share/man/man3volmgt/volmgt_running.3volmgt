.SH NAME
volmgt_running \- return whether or not volume management is running
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lvolmgt\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <volmgt.h>

\fBint\fR \fBvolmgt_running\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including \fBvold\fR, has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See \fBhal\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
\fBvolmgt_running()\fR tells whether or not Volume Management is running.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBvolmgt_running()\fR always returns \fB0\fR indicating Volume Management (as implemented by \fBvold\fR) is not running.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBvolmgt_running()\fR will fail, returning \fB0\fR, if a \fBstat\fR(2) or \fBopen\fR(2) of \fB/dev/volctl\fR fails, or if any of the following is true:
.sp

To see if Volume Management is running:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
if (volmgt_running() != 0) {
        (void) printf("Volume Management is running\en");
} else {
        (void) printf("Volume Management is NOT running\en");
}
