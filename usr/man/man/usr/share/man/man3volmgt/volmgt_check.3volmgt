.SH NAME
volmgt_check \- have Volume Management check for media
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lvolmgt\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <volmgt.h>

\fBint\fR \fBvolmgt_check\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIpathname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including \fBvold\fR, has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See \fBhal\fR(5). The return value of this function is undefined.
.sp
.LP
This routine asks volume Management to check the specified \fIpathname\fR and determine if new media has been inserted in that drive.
.sp
.LP
If a null pointer is passed in, then Volume Management will check each device it is managing that can be checked.
.sp
.LP
If new media is found, \fBvolmgt_check()\fR tells volume management to initiate appropriate actions. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The return from this function is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
This routine can fail, returning \fB0\fR, if a \fBstat\fR(2) or \fBopen\fR(2) of the supplied \fIpathname\fR fails, or if any of the following is true:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENXIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
volume management is not running.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
An interrupt signal was detected while checking for media.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRChecking If Any New Media Is Inserted
.sp
.LP
To check if any drive managed by volume management has any new media inserted in it:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
if (volmgt_check(NULL)) {
        (void) printf("Volume management found media\en");
}
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This would also request volume management to take whatever action was appropriate for the new media.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Since \fBvolmgt_check()\fR returns  \fB0\fR for two different cases (both when no media is found, and when an error occurs), it is up to the user to check \fIerrno\fR to differentiate the two, and to ensure that volume management is running.
