.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlibtecla_version()\fR function queries for the version number of the library.
.sp
.LP
On return, this function records the three components of the libtecla version number in *\fImajor\fR, *\fIminor\fR, *\fImicro\fR. The formal meaning of the three components is as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmajor\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
Incrementing this number implies that a change has been made to the library's public interface that makes it binary incompatible with programs that were linked with previous shared versions of libtecla.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBminor\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
This number is incremented by one whenever additional functionality, such as new functions or modules, are added to the library.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmicro\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
This number is incremented whenever modifications to the library are made that make no changes to the public interface, but which fix bugs and/or improve the behind-the-scenes implementation.
