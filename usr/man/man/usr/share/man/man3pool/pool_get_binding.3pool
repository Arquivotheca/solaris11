.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_get_binding()\fR function returns the name of the pool on the running system that contains the set of resources to which the given process is bound. If no such pool exists on the system or the search returns more than one pool (since the set of resources is referred to by more than one pool), \fINULL\fR is  returned and the pool error value is set to \fBPOE_INVALID_SEARCH\fR.
.sp
.LP
It is possible that one of the resources to which the given process is bound is not associated with a pool. This could occur if a processor set was created with one of the \fBpset_()\fR functions and the process was then bound to that set. It could also occur if the process was bound to a resource set not currently associated with a pool, since resources can exist that are not associated with a pool.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_set_binding()\fR function binds the processes matching \fIidtype\fR and \fIid\fR to the resources associated with \fIpool\fR on the running system. This function requires the privilege required by the underlying resource types referenced by the pool; generally, this requirement is equivalent to requiring superuser privilege.
.sp
.LP
The \fIidtype\fR parameter can be of the following types:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBP_PID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The \fIid\fR parameter is a pid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBP_TASKID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The \fIid\fR parameter is a taskid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBP_PROJID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The \fIid\fR parameter is a project ID. All currently running processes belonging to the given project will be bound to the pool's resources.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_get_resource_binding()\fR function returns the name of the resource of the supplied type to which the supplied process is bound.
.sp
.LP
The application must explicity free the memory allocated for the return values for \fBpool_get_binding()\fR and \fBpool_get_resource_binding()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpool_get_binding()\fR returns the name of the pool to which the process is bound. Otherwise it returns \fINULL\fR and \fBpool_error\fR(3POOL) returns the pool-specific error value.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpool_set_binding()\fR returns \fBPO_SUCCESS\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fBPO_FAIL\fR and \fBpool_error()\fR returns the pool-specific error value.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpool_get_resource_binding()\fR returns the name of the resource of the specified type to which the process is bound. Otherwise it returns \fINULL\fR and \fBpool_error()\fR returns the pool-specific error value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_get_binding()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOE_INVALID_SEARCH\fR\fR
