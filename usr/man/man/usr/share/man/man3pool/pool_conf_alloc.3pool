.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions enable the access and creation of configuration files associated with the pools facility.  Since the pool configuration is an opaque type, an initial configuration is obtained with \fBpool_conf_alloc()\fR and released with \fBpool_conf_free()\fR when the configuration is no longer of interest. The \fIconf\fR argument for each function refers to the target configuration to which the operation applies.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_close()\fR function closes the given configuration, releasing associated resources.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_commit()\fR function commits changes made to the given \fBpool_conf_t\fR to permanent storage. If the \fIactive\fR flag is non-zero, the state of the system will be configured to match that described in the supplied \fBpool_conf_t\fR. If configuring the system fails, \fBpool_conf_commit()\fR will attempt to restore the system to its previous state.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_export()\fR function saves the given configuration to the specified location. The only currently supported value of \fIformat\fR is \fBPOX_NATIVE\fR, which is the format native to \fBlibpool\fR, the output of which can be used as input to \fBpool_conf_open()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_info()\fR function returns a string describing the entire configuration.  The string is allocated with \fBmalloc\fR(3C). The caller is responsible for freeing the returned string. If the flags option is non-zero, the string returned also describes the sub-elements (if any) contained in the configuration.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_location()\fR function returns the location string provided to \fBpool_conf_open()\fR for the given \fBpool_conf_t\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_open()\fR function creates a \fBpool_conf_t\fR given a location at which the configuration is stored. The valid flags are a bitmap of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPO_RDONLY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Open for reading only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPO_RDWR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Open read-write.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPO_CREAT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Create a configuration at the given location if it does not exist. If it does, truncate it.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPO_DISCO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Perform `discovery'. This option only makes sense when used in conjunction with \fBPO_CREAT\fR, and causes the returned \fBpool_conf_t\fR to contain the resources and components currently active on the system.
.sp
The use of this flag is deprecated. \fBPO_CREAT\fR always performs discovery. If supplied, this flag is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPO_UPDATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Use when opening the dynamic state file, which is the configuration at \fBpool_dynamic_location\fR(3POOL), to ensure that the contents of the dynamic state file are updated to represent the current state of the system.
.sp
The use of this flag is deprecated. The dynamic state is always current and does not require updating. If supplied, this flag is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.LP
A call to \fBpool_conf_open()\fR with the pool dynamic location and write permission will hang if the dynamic location has already been opened for writing.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_remove()\fR function removes the configuration's permanent storage. If the configuration is still open, it is first closed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_rollback()\fR function restores the configuration state to that held in the configuration's permanent storage. This will either be the state last successfully committed (using \fBpool_conf_commit()\fR) or the state when the configuration was opened if there have been no successfully committed changes since then.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_status()\fR function returns the status of a configuration, which can be one of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOF_INVALID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The configuration is not in a suitable state for use.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOF_VALID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The configuration is in a suitable state for use.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_update()\fR function updates the library snapshot of kernel state. If \fIchanged\fR is non-null, it is updated to identify which types of configuration elements changed during the update. To check for change, treat the \fIchanged\fR value as a bitmap of possible element types.
.sp
.LP
A change is defined for the different element classes as follows: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOU_SYSTEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A property on the system element has been created, modified, or removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOU_POOL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A property on a pool element has been created, modified, or removed. A pool has changed a resource association.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOU_PSET\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A property on a pset element has been created, modified, or removed. A pset's resource composition has changed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOU_CPU\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A property on a CPU element has been created, modified, or removed.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_validate()\fR function checks the validity of the contents of the given configuration. The validation can be at several (increasing) levels of strictness:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOV_LOOSE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Performs basic internal syntax validation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOV_STRICT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Performs a more thorough syntax validation and internal consistency checks.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOV_RUNTIME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Performs an estimate of whether attempting to commit the given configuration on the system would succeed or fail. It is optimistic in that a successful validation does not guarantee a subsequent commit operation will be successful; it is conservative in that a failed validation indicates that a subsequent commit operation on the current system will always fail.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpool_conf_alloc()\fR returns an initialized \fBpool_conf_t\fR pointer. Otherwise it returns \fINULL\fR and \fBpool_error\fR(3POOL) returns the pool-specific error value.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpool_conf_close()\fR, \fBpool_conf_commit()\fR, \fBpool_conf_export()\fR, \fBpool_conf_open()\fR, \fBpool_conf_remove()\fR, \fBpool_conf_rollback()\fR, \fBpool_conf_update()\fR, and \fBpool_conf_validate()\fR return 0. Otherwise they return -1 and \fBpool_error()\fR returns the pool-specific error value.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpool_conf_status()\fR function returns either \fBPOF_INVALID\fR or \fBPOF_VALID\fR.
