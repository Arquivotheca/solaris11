.SH NAME
lgrp_init \- initialize lgroup interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-llgrp\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ] 
#include <sys/lgrp_user.h>

\fBlgrp_cookie_t\fR \fBlgrp_init\fR(\fBlgrp_view_t\fR \fIview\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_init()\fR function initializes the lgroup interface and takes a snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy with the given \fIview\fR.  If the given \fIview\fR is \fBLGRP_VIEW_CALLER\fR, the snapshot contains only the resources that are available to the caller (for example, with respect to processor sets). When the \fIview\fR is \fBLGRP_VIEW_OS\fR, the snapshot contains what is available to the operating system.
.sp
.LP
Given the \fIview\fR, \fBlgrp_init()\fR returns a cookie representing this snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy. This cookie should be used with other routines in the lgroup interface needing the lgroup hierarchy. The \fBlgrp_fini\fR(3LGRP) function should be called with the cookie when it is no longer needed.
.sp
.LP
The lgroup hiearchy represents the latency topology of the machine.  The hierarchy is simplified to be a tree and can be used to find the nearest resources.
.sp
.LP
The lgroup hiearchy consists of a root lgroup, which is the maximum  bounding locality group of the system, contains all the CPU and memory resources of the machine, and may contain  other locality groups that contain CPUs and memory within a smaller locality. The leaf lgroups contain resources within the smallest latency.
.sp
.LP
The resources of a given lgroup come directly from the lgroup itself or from leaf lgroups contained within the lgroup. Leaf lgroups directly contain their own resources and do not encapsulate any other lgroups.
.sp
.LP
The lgroup hierarchy can be used to find the nearest resources. From a given lgroup, the closest resources can be found in the lgroup itself. After that, the next nearest resources can be found in its parent lgroup, and so on until the root lgroup is reached where all the resources of the machine are located.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBlgrp_init()\fR returns a cookie. Otherwise it returns \fBLGRP_COOKIE_NONE\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
