.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_cookie_stale()\fR function takes a \fIcookie\fR representing the snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from \fBlgrp_init\fR(3LGRP) and returns whether it is stale. The snapshot can become out-of-date for a number of reasons depending on its view.  If the snapshot was taken with \fBLGRP_VIEW_OS\fR, changes in the lgroup hierarchy from dynamic reconfiguration, CPU on/offline, or other conditions can cause the snapshot to become out-of-date. A snapshot taken with \fBLGRP_VIEW_CALLER\fR can be affected by the caller's processor set binding and changes in its processor set itself, as well as changes in the lgroup hierarchy.
.sp
.LP
If the snapshot needs to be updated, \fBlgrp_fini\fR(3LGRP) should be called with the old cookie and \fBlgrp_init()\fR should be called to obtain a new snapshot.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBlgrp_cookie_stale()\fR returns whether the cookie is stale. Otherwise, it returns \(mi1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
