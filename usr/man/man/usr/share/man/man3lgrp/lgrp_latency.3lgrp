.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_latency_cookie()\fR function takes a cookie representing a snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from \fBlgrp_init\fR(3LGRP) and returns the latency value between a hardware resource in the \fIfrom\fR lgroup to a hardware resource in the \fIto\fR lgroup. If \fIfrom\fR is the same lgroup as \fIto\fR, the latency value within that lgroup is returned.
.sp
.LP
The \fIbetween\fR argument should be set to the following value to specify between which hardware resources the latency should be measured:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LGRP_LAT_CPU_TO_MEM     /* latency from CPU to memory */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The latency value is defined by the operating system and is platform-specific. It can be used only for relative comparison of lgroups on the running system. It does not necessarily represent the actual latency between hardware devices, and it might not be applicable across platforms.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_latency()\fR function is similiar to the \fBlgrp_latency_cookie()\fR function, but returns the latency between the given lgroups at the given instant in time. Since lgroups can be freed and reallocated, this function might not be able to provide a consistent answer across calls. For that reason, the \fBlgrp_latency_cookie()\fR function should be used in its place.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the latency value is returned. Otherwise \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBlgrp_latency_cookie()\fR and \fBlgrp_latency()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The specified cookie, lgroup ID, or value given for the \fIbetween\fR argument is not valid.
