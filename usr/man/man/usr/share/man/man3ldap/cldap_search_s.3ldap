.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcldap_search_s()\fR function performs an LDAP search using the Connectionless LDAP (CLDAP) protocol.
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR has parameters and behavior identical to that of \fBldap_search_s\fR(3LDAP), except for the addition of the \fIlogdn\fR parameter.  \fIlogdn\fR should contain a distinguished name to be used only for logging purposed by the LDAP server.  It should be in the text format described by \fIRFC 1779, A String Representation of Distinguished Names\fR. 
.SS "Retransmission Algorithm"
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR operates using the CLDAP protocol over \fBudp\fR(7P). Since UDP is a non-reliable protocol, a retry mechanism is used to increase reliability. The \fBcldap_setretryinfo\fR(3LDAP) function can be used to set two retry parameters:  \fItries\fR, a count of the number of times to send a search request and \fItimeout\fR, an initial timeout that determines how long to wait for a response before re-trying. \fItimeout\fR is specified seconds.  These values are stored in the \fBld_cldaptries\fR and \fBld_cldaptimeout\fR members of the \fBld\fR LDAP structure, and the default values set in \fBldap_open\fR(3LDAP) are 4 and 3 respectively. The retransmission algorithm used is:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBStep 1\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Set the current timeout to \fBld_cldaptimeout\fR seconds, and the current LDAP server address to the first LDAP server found during the \fBldap_open\fR(3LDAP) call.

Send the search request to the current LDAP server address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBStep 3\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Set the wait timeout to the current timeout divided by the number of server addresses found during \fBldap_open\fR(3LDAP) or to one second, whichever is larger. Wait at most that long for a response; if a response is received, STOP. Note that the wait timeout is always rounded down to the next lowest second.

\fBStep 4\fR

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each LDAP server address.
.RE

.sp

\fBStep 5\fR

Set the current timeout to twice its previous value and repeat Steps 2 through 5 a maximum of \fItries\fR times.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Assume that the default values for \fItries\fR and \fItimeout\fR of 4 tries and 3 seconds are used. Further, assume that a space-separated list of two hosts, each with one address, was passed to \fBcldap_open\fR(3LDAP). The pattern of requests sent will be (stopping as soon as a response is received): 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
  Time		Search Request Sent To:
   +0			Host A try 1
   +1  (0+3/2)		Host B try 1
   +2  (1+3/2)		Host A try 2
   +5  (2+6/2)		Host B try 2
   +8  (5+6/2)		Host A try 3
   +14 (8+12/2)	Host B try 3
   +20 (14+12/2)	Host A try 4
   +32 (20+24/2)	Host B try 4
   +44 (20+24/2)	(give up - no response)
.fi
.in -2

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBcldap_search_s()\fR returns  \fBLDAP_SUCCESS\fR if a search was successful and the appropriate LDAP error code otherwise.  See \fBldap_error\fR(3LDAP) for more information.
