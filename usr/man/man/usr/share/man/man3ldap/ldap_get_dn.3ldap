.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions allow LDAP entry names (Distinguished Names, or DNs) to be obtained, parsed, converted to a user-friendly form, and tested. A DN has the form described in RFC 1779  \fIA String Representation of Distinguished Names\fR, unless it is an experimental DNS-style DN which takes the form of an \fIRFC 822\fR mail address.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_get_dn()\fR function takes an \fIentry\fR as returned by \fBldap_first_entry\fR(3LDAP) or \fBldap_next_entry\fR(3LDAP) and returns a copy of the entry's DN.  Space for the DN will have been obtained by means of \fBmalloc\fR(3C), and should be freed by the caller by a call to \fBfree\fR(3C). 
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_explode_dn()\fR function takes a DN as returned by \fBldap_get_dn()\fR and breaks it up into its component parts.  Each part is known as a Relative Distinguished Name, or RDN. \fBldap_explode_dn()\fR returns a null-terminated array, each component of which contains an RDN from the DN.  The \fInotypes\fR parameter is used to request that only the RDN values be returned, not their types.  For example, the DN "cn=Bob, c=US" would return as either { "cn=Bob", "c=US", NULL } or { "Bob", "US", NULL }, depending on whether notypes was 0 or 1, respectively. The result can be freed by calling \fBldap_value_free\fR(3LDAP). 
.sp
.LP
\fBldap_dn2ufn()\fR is used to turn a DN as returned by \fBldap_get_dn()\fR into a more user-friendly form, stripping off type names.  See \fIRFC 1781\fR "Using the Directory to Achieve User Friendly Naming" for more details on the UFN format.  The space for the UFN returned is obtained by a call to \fBmalloc\fR(3C), and the user is responsible for freeing it by means of a call to \fBfree\fR(3C). 
.sp
.LP
\fBldap_is_dns_dn()\fR returns non-zero if the dn string is an experimental DNS-style DN (generally in the form of an \fIRFC 822\fR e-mail address).  It returns zero if the dn appears to be an \fIRFC 1779\fR format DN.
.sp
.LP
\fBldap_explode_dns()\fR takes a DNS-style DN and breaks it up into its component parts. \fBldap_explode_dns()\fR returns a null-terminated array. For example, the DN "mcs.umich.edu" will return { "mcs", "umich", "edu", NULL }.  The result can be freed by calling \fBldap_value_free\fR(3LDAP). 
.sp
.LP
\fBldap_dns_to_dn()\fR converts a DNS domain name into an X.500 distinguished name. A string distinguished name and the number of nameparts is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
If an error occurs in \fBldap_get_dn()\fR, \fINULL\fR is returned and the \fBld_errno\fR field in the \fIld\fR parameter is set to indicate the error.  See \fBldap_error\fR(3LDAP) for a description of possible error codes. \fBldap_explode_dn()\fR, \fBldap_explode_dns()\fR and \fBldap_dn2ufn()\fR will return  \fINULL\fR with \fBerrno\fR(3C) set appropriately in case of trouble.
.sp
.LP
If an error in \fBldap_dns_to_dn()\fR is encountered zero is returned. The caller should free the returned string if it is non-zero.
