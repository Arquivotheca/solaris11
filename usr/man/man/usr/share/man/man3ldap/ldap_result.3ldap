.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_result()\fR function is used to wait for and return the result of an operation previously initiated by one of the LDAP asynchronous operation functions , for example, \fBldap_search\fR(3LDAP), and \fBldap_modify\fR(3LDAP). Those functions all return  \fB\(mi1\fR in case of error, and an invocation identifier upon successful initiation of the operation. The invocation identifier is picked by the library and is guaranteed to be unique across the LDAP session.  It can be used to request the result of a specific operation from \fBldap_result()\fR through the \fImsgid\fR parameter.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_result()\fR function will block or not, depending upon the setting of the \fItimeout\fR parameter. If \fItimeout\fR is not a null pointer, it specifies a  maximum interval to wait for the selection to complete.  If \fItimeout\fR is a null pointer, the select blocks indefinitely. To effect a poll, the \fItimeout\fR argument should be a non-null pointer, pointing to a zero-valued \fBtimeval\fR structure.  See \fBselect\fR(3C) for further details.
.sp
.LP
If the result of a specific operation is required, \fImsgid\fR should be set to the invocation identifier returned when the operation was initiated, otherwise  \fBLDAP_RES_ANY\fR should be supplied.  The \fIall\fR parameter only has meaning for search responses and is used to select whether a single entry of the search response should be returned, or all results of the search should be returned.
.sp
.LP
A search response is made up of zero or more search entries followed by a search result.  If \fIall\fR is set to 0, search entries will be returned one at a time as they come in, by means of separate calls to \fBldap_result()\fR. If it is set to a non-zero value, the search response will only be returned in its entirety, that is, after all entries and the final search result have been received.
.sp
.LP
Upon success, the type of the result received is returned and the \fIresult\fR parameter will contain the result of the operation.  This result should be passed to the LDAP parsing functions, (see \fBldap_first_entry\fR(3LDAP)) for interpretation.
.sp
.LP
The possible result types returned are:

.LP
The \fBldap_msgfree()\fR function is used to free the memory allocated for a result by \fBldap_result()\fR or \fBldap_search_s\fR(3LDAP) functions.  It takes a pointer to the result to be freed and returns the type of the message it freed.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_result()\fR function returns \fB\(mi1\fR on error and 0 if the specified timeout was exceeded.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_result()\fR function allocates memory for results that it receives.  The memory can be freed by calling \fBldap_msgfree\fR(3LDAP).
