.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This module is used for manipulating \fBlibexacct\fR(3LIB) Group objects. A \fBlibexacct\fR Group object is represented as an opaque reference blessed into the \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object::Group\fR class, which is a subclass of the \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object\fR class. The Items within a Group are stored inside a Perl array. A reference to the array can be accessed with the inherited \fBvalue()\fR method. The individual Items within a Group can be manipulated with the normal Perl array syntax and operators. All data elements of the array must be derived from the \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object\fR class.  Group objects can also be nested inside each other simply by adding an existing Group as a data Item.

Class methods include those inherited from the \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object\fR base class, plus the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnew($catalog, @objects)\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
This method creates and returns a new \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object::Group\fR. The catalog tag can be either an integer or a \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Catalog\fR. The catalog tag should be a valid catalog tag for a Perl exacct Group object. The \fB@objects\fR parameter is a list of \fBSun::Solaris::Exacct::Object\fR to be stored inside the Group. A copy of all the passed Items is taken and any Group objects are recursively copied. The contents of the returned Group object can be accessed with the array returned by the value method.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBas_hash()\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
This method returns the contents of the group as a hash reference. It uses the string value of each item's catalog ID as the hash entry key and the scalar value returned by \fBvalue()\fR as the hash entry value. This form should be used if  there are no duplicate catalog tags in the group.
.sp
This method and its companion \fBas_hashlist()\fR are the fastest ways to access the contents of a Group.

.rt  
This method returns the contents of the group as a hash reference. It uses the string value of each item's catalog id as the hash entry key and an array of the scalar values returned by \fBvalue()\fR as the hash entry value for all the items that share a common key. This form should be used if there might be duplicate catalog tags in the group.
