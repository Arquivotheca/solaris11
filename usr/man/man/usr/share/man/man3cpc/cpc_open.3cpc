.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcpc_open()\fR function initializes \fBlibcpc\fR(3LIB) and returns an identifier that must be used as the \fIcpc\fR argument in subsequent \fBlibcpc\fR function calls. The \fBcpc_open()\fR function takes an interface version as an argument and returns \fINULL\fR if that version of the interface is incompatible with the \fBlibcpc\fR implementation present on the system. Usually, the argument has the value of \fBCPC_VER_CURRENT\fR bound to the application when it was compiled.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcpc_close()\fR function releases all resources associated with the \fIcpc\fR argument. Any bound counters utilized by the process are unbound. All entities of type \fBcpc_set_t\fR and \fBcpc_buf_t\fR are invalidated and destroyed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the version requested is supported by the implementation, \fBcpc_open()\fR returns a \fBcpc_t\fR handle for use in all subsequent \fBlibcpc\fR operations. If the implementation cannot support the version needed by the application, \fBcpc_open()\fR returns \fINULL\fR, indicating that the application at least needs to be recompiled to operate correctly on the new platform and might require further changes.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcpc_close()\fR function always returns 0.
.SH ERRORS

The version requested by the client is incompatible with the implementation.
