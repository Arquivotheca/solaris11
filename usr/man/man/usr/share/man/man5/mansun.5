.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These macros are used to lay out the reference pages in this manual. Note: if \fIfilename\fR contains format input for a preprocessor, the commands shown above must be piped through the appropriate preprocessor. This is handled automatically by \fBman\fR(1). See the ``Conventions'' section.
.sp
.LP
Any text argument \fIt\fR may be zero to six words. Quotes may be used to include SPACE characters in a "word".  If \fItext\fR is empty, the special treatment is applied to the next input line with text to be printed. In this way \fB\&.I\fR may be used to italicize a whole line, or \fB\&.SB\fR may be used to make small bold letters.
.sp
.LP
A prevailing indent distance is remembered between successive indented paragraphs, and is reset to default value upon reaching a non-indented paragraph.  Default units for indents \fIi\fR are ens.
.sp
.LP
Type font and size are reset to default values before each paragraph, and after processing font and size setting macros.
.sp
.LP
These strings are predefined by \fB-mansun\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\e*R\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
`\(rg', `(Reg)' in \fBnroff\fR.

.SS "Conventions"
.sp
.LP
When formatting a manual page, \fBmansun\fR examines the first line to determine whether it requires special processing. For example a first line consisting of:
.sp
.LP
\fB\&'\e" t\fR
.sp
.LP
indicates that the manual page must be run through the \fBtbl\fR(1) preprocessor.
.sp
.LP
A typical manual page for a command or function is laid out as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\&.TH\fI title \fR[1-8]\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The name of the command or function, which serves as the title of the manual page. This is followed by the number of the section in which it appears.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\&.SH NAME\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The name, or list of names, by which the command is called, followed by a dash and then a one-line summary of the action performed. All in Roman font, this section contains no \fBtroff\fR(1) commands or escapes, and no macro requests. It is used to generate the \fBwindex\fR database, which is used by the  \fBwhatis\fR(1) command.

\fBCommands:\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The syntax of the command and its arguments, as typed on the command line.  When in boldface, a word must be typed exactly as printed.  When in italics, a word can be replaced with an argument that you supply. References to bold or italicized items are not capitalized in other sections, even when they begin a sentence.
.sp
Syntactic symbols appear in Roman face: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB[ ]\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
An argument, when surrounded by brackets is optional.

\fB\&.SH DESCRIPTION\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A narrative overview of the command or function's external behavior. This includes how it interacts with files or data, and how it handles the standard input, standard output and standard error. Internals and implementation details are normally omitted. This section attempts to provide a succinct overview in answer to the question, "what does it do?"
.sp
Literal text from the synopsis appears in constant width, as do literal filenames and references to items that appear elsewhere in the  reference manuals. Arguments are italicized.
.sp
If a command interprets either subcommands or an input grammar, its command interface or input grammar is normally described in a \fBUSAGE\fR section, which follows the \fBOPTIONS\fR section.  The  \fBDESCRIPTION\fR section only describes the behavior of the command itself, not that of subcommands.
