.SH NAME
device_clean \- device clean programs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Each allocatable device has a device clean program associated with it. Device clean programs are invoked by \fBdeallocate\fR(1) to clean device states, registers, and any residual information in the device before the device is allocated to a user. Such cleaning is required by the object reuse policy.
.sp
.LP
Use \fBlist_devices\fR(1) to obtain the names and types of allocatable devices as well as the cleaning program and the authorizations that are associated with each device.
.sp
.LP
On a system configured with Trusted Extensions, device clean programs are also invoked by \fBallocate\fR(1), in which case the program can optionally mount appropriate media for the caller.
.sp
.LP
The following device clean programs reside in \fB/etc/security/lib\fR.
