.SH NAME
audit_syslog \- realtime conversion of Solaris audit data to syslog messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/audit_syslog.so\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaudit_syslog\fR plugin module for Solaris audit, \fB/usr/lib/security/audit_syslog.so\fR, provides realtime conversion of Solaris audit data to syslog-formatted (text) data and sends it to a syslog daemon as configured in \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4). The plugin's path is specified with the \fBauditconfig\fR(1M) utility.
.sp
.LP
Messages to \fBsyslog\fR are written if the \fBplugin\fR is configured as an active via \fBauditconfig\fR. Use the \fBauditconfig\fR \fB-setplugin\fR option to change all the plugin related configuration parameters. Syslog messages are generated with the facility code of \fBLOG_AUDIT\fR (\fBaudit\fR in \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4)) and severity of \fBLOG_NOTICE\fR. Audit \fBsyslog\fR messages contain data selected from the tokens described for the binary audit log. (See \fBaudit.log\fR(4)). As with all \fBsyslog\fR messages, each line in a \fBsyslog\fR file consists of two parts, a \fBsyslog\fR header and a message.
.sp
.LP
The syslog header contains the date and time the message was generated, the host name from which it was sent, \fBauditd\fR to indicate that it was generated by the audit daemon, an ID field used internally by \fBsyslogd\fR, and \fBaudit.notice\fR indicating the \fBsyslog\fR facility and severity values. The \fBsyslog\fR header ends with the characters \fB]\fR, that is, a closing square bracket and a space.
.sp
.LP
The message part starts with the event type from the header token. All subsequent data appears only if contained in the original audit record and there is room in the 1024-byte maximum length \fBsyslog\fR line. In the following example, the backslash (\fB\e\fR) indicates a continuation; actual \fBsyslog\fR messages are contained on one line:

.SH OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBp_flag\fR attribute is used to further filter audit data being sent to the \fBsyslog\fR daemon beyond the classes specified through the \fBflags\fR and \fBnaflags\fR (see \fBauditconfig\fR(1M)) and through the user-specific lines of \fBuser_attr\fR(4). The parameter is a comma-separated list; each item represents an audit class (see \fBaudit_class\fR(4)) and is specified using the syntax described in \fBaudit_flags\fR(5). The default (empty \fBp_flags\fR listed) is that no audit records are generated.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fROne Use of the \fBplugin\fR Line
.sp
.LP
In the specification shown below, the \fBplugin\fR (in conjunction with setting \fBflags\fR and \fBnaflags\fR) is used to allow class records for \fBlo\fR but allows class records for \fBam\fR for failures only. Omission of the \fBfm\fR class records results in no \fBfm\fR class records being output. The \fBpc\fR parameter has no effect because you cannot add classes to those defined by means of \fBflags\fR and \fBnaflags\fR and by \fBuser_attr\fR(4). You can only remove them.

.sp
.LP
In the specification shown below, with one exception, \fBall\fR allows all flags defined by means of \fBflags\fR and \fBnaflags\fR (and \fBuser_attr\fR(4)). The exception the \fBam\fR metaclass, which is equivalent to \fBss,as,ua\fR, which is modified to output all \fBua\fR events but only failure events for \fBss\fR and \fBas\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Activating the \fBaudit_syslog\fR \fBplugin\fR requires that \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR is configured to store \fBsyslog\fR messages of facility \fBaudit\fR and severity \fBnotice\fR or above in a file intended for Solaris audit records. An example of such a line in \fBsyslog.conf\fR is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
audit.notice                /var/audit/audit.log
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Messages from \fBsyslog\fR are sent to remote \fBsyslog\fR servers by means of UDP, which does not guarantee delivery or ensure the correct order of arrival of messages.
.sp
.LP
If the parameters specified for the \fBplugin\fR line result in no classes being preselected, an error is reported by means of a \fBsyslog\fR alert with the \fBLOG_DAEMON\fR facility code.
.sp
.LP
The time field in the \fBsyslog\fR header is generated by \fBsyslog\fR(3C) and only approximates the time given in the binary audit log. Normally the time field shows the same whole second or at most a few seconds difference.
