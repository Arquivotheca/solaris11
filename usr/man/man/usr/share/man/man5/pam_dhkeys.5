.SH NAME
pam_dhkeys \- authentication Diffie-Hellman keys management module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpam_dhkeys.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_dhkeys.so.1\fR service module provides functionality to two \fBPAM\fR services: Secure \fBRPC\fR authentication and Secure \fBRPC\fR authentication token management.
.sp
.LP
Secure RPC authentication differs from regular Unix authentication because \fBONC RPC\fRs use Secure RPC as the underlying security mechanism.
.sp
.LP
The following options may be passed to the module:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdebug\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
\fBsyslog\fR(3C) debugging information at \fBLOG_DEBUG\fR level

.sp
.ne 2

.na
\fBnowarn\fR

.RS 10n
.rt

.SS "Authentication Services"
.sp
.LP
If the user has Diffie-Hellman keys, \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR establishes secret keys for the user specified by the \fBPAM_USER\fR (equivalent to running \fBkeylogin\fR(1)), using the authentication token found in the \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR item. If \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR is called with \fBPAM_ESTABLISH_CRED\fR and the user's secure \fBRPC\fR credentials need to be established, these credentials are set. This is equivalent to running \fBkeylogin\fR(1). 
.sp
.LP
If the credentials could not be set and \fBPAM_SILENT\fR is not specified, a diagnostic message is displayed. If \fBpam_setcred()\fR is called with \fBPAM_DELETE_CRED\fR, the user's secure \fBRPC\fR credentials are unset. This is equivalent to running \fBkeylogout\fR(1). 
.sp
.LP
\fBPAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED\fR and \fBPAM_REFRESH_CRED\fR are not supported and return \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR. 
.SS "Authentication Token Management"
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_sm_chauthtok()\fR implementation checks whether the old login password decrypts the users secret keys. If it doesn't this module prompts the user for an old Secure \fBRPC\fR password and stores it in a pam data item called \fBSUNW_OLDRPCPASS\fR. This data item can be used by the store module to effectively update the users secret keys.
