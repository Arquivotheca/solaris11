In a program, you use \fBsetrctl\fR(2) to set resource control values.

.LP
In addition to the preceding resource controls, there are resource pools, accessible through the \fBpooladm\fR(1M) and \fBpoolcfg\fR(1M) utilities. In a program, resource pools can be manipulated through the \fBlibpool\fR(3LIB) library.

Scaled values can be used with resource controls. The following example shows a scaled threshold value:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
task.max-lwps=(priv,1K,deny)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
In the \fBproject\fR file, the value \fB1K\fR is expanded to \fB1000\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
task.max-lwps=(priv,1000,deny)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
A second example uses a larger scaled value:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
process.max-file-size=(priv,5G,deny)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
In the \fBproject\fR file, the value \fB5G\fR is expanded to \fB5368709120\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
process.max-file-size=(priv,5368709120,deny)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The preceding examples use the scaling factors specified in the table above.
.sp
.LP
Note that unit modifiers (for example, \fB5G\fR) are accepted by the \fBprctl\fR(1), \fBprojadd\fR(1M), and \fBprojmod\fR(1M) commands. You cannot use unit modifiers in the project database itself.
.SS "Resource Control Values and Privilege Levels"
.sp
.LP
A threshold value on a resource control constitutes a point at which local actions can be triggered or global actions, such as logging, can occur.
.sp
.LP
Each threshold value on a resource control must be associated with a privilege level. The privilege level must be one of the following three types:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbasic\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Can be modified by the owner of the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBprivileged\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Can be modified by the current process (requiring \fBsys_resource\fR privilege) or by \fBprctl\fR(1) (requiring \fBproc_owner\fR privilege).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsystem\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Fixed for the duration of the operating system instance.
.RE

.sp
.LP
A resource control is guaranteed to have one \fBsystem\fR value, which is defined by the system, or resource provider. The \fBsystem\fR value represents how much of the resource the current implementation of the operating system is capable of providing.
.sp
.LP
Any number of privileged values can be defined, and only one basic value is allowed. Operations that are performed without specifying a privilege value are assigned a basic privilege by default.
.sp
.LP
The privilege level for a resource control value is defined in the privilege field of the resource control block as \fBRCTL_BASIC\fR, \fBRCTL_PRIVILEGED\fR, or \fBRCTL_SYSTEM\fR. See \fBsetrctl\fR(2) for more information. You can use the \fBprctl\fR command to modify values that are associated with basic and privileged levels.
.sp
.LP
In specifying the privilege level of \fBprivileged\fR, you can use the abbreviation \fBpriv\fR. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
task.max-lwps=(priv,1K,deny)
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Global and Local Actions on Resource Control Values"
.sp
.LP
There are two categories of actions on resource control values: global and local.
.sp
.LP
Global actions apply to resource control values for every resource control on the system. You can use \fBrctladm\fR(1M) to perform the following actions:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Display the global state of active system resource controls.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Set global logging actions.
.RE
.sp
.LP
You can disable or enable the global logging action on resource controls. You can set the \fBsyslog\fR action to a specific degree by assigning a severity level, \fBsyslog=\fR\fIlevel\fR. The possible settings for \fIlevel\fR are as follows:
.RS +4

By default, there is no global logging of resource control violations.
.sp
.LP
Local actions are taken on a process that attempts to exceed the control value. For each threshold value that is placed on a resource control, you can associate one or more actions. There are three types of local actions: \fBnone\fR, \fBdeny\fR, and \fBsignal=\fR. These three actions are used as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnone\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
No action is taken on resource requests for an amount that is greater than the threshold. This action is useful for monitoring resource usage without affecting the progress of applications. You can also enable a global message that displays when the resource control is exceeded, while, at the same time, the process exceeding the threshhold is not affected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdeny\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
You can deny resource requests for an amount that is greater than the threshold. For example, a \fBtask.max-lwps\fR resource control with action deny causes a \fBfork()\fR system call to fail if the new process would exceed the control value. See the \fBfork\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsignal=\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
You can enable a global signal message action when the resource control is exceeded. A signal is sent to the process when the threshold value is exceeded. Additional signals are not sent if the process consumes additional resources. Available signals are listed below.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Not all of the actions can be applied to every resource control. For example, a process cannot exceed the number of CPU shares assigned to the project of which it is a member. Therefore, a deny action is not allowed on the \fBproject.cpu-shares\fR resource control.
.sp
.LP
Due to implementation restrictions, the global properties of each control can restrict the range of available actions that can be set on the threshold value. (See \fBrctladm\fR(1M).) A list of available signal actions is presented in the following list. For additional information about signals, see \fBsignal\fR(3HEAD).

.RE

.SS "Resource Control Flags and Properties"
.sp
.LP
Each resource control on the system has a certain set of associated properties. This set of properties is defined as a set of flags, which are associated with all controlled instances of that resource. Global flags cannot be modified, but the flags can be retrieved by using either \fBrctladm\fR(1M) or the \fBsetrctl\fR(2) system call.
.sp
.LP
Local flags define the default behavior and configuration for a specific threshold value of that resource control on a specific process or process collective. The local flags for one threshold value do not affect the behavior of other defined threshold values for the same resource control. However, the global flags affect the behavior for every value associated with a particular control. Local flags can be modified, within the constraints supplied by their corresponding global flags, by the \fBprctl\fR command or the \fBsetrctl\fR system call. See \fBsetrctl\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
For the complete list of local flags, global flags, and their definitions, see \fBrctlblk_set_value\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
To determine system behavior when a threshold value for a particular resource control is reached, use \fBrctladm\fR to display the global flags for the resource control . For example, to display the values for \fBprocess.max-cpu-time\fR, enter:
.sp
.in +2

Use the \fBprctl\fR command to display local values and actions for the resource control. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ prctl -n process.max-cpu-time $$
    process 353939: -ksh
    NAME    PRIVILEGE    VALUE    FLAG   ACTION              RECIPIENT
 process.max-cpu-time
         privileged   18.4Es    inf   signal=XCPU                 -
         system       18.4Es    inf   none
.fi
.in -2

The \fBmax\fR (\fBRCTL_LOCAL_MAXIMAL\fR) flag is set for both threshold values, and the \fBinf\fR (\fBRCTL_GLOBAL_INFINITE\fR) flag is defined for this resource control. An \fBinf\fR value has an infinite quantity. The value is never enforced. Hence, as configured, both threshold quantities represent infinite values that are never exceeded.

More than one resource control can exist on a resource. A resource control can exist at each containment level in the process model. If resource controls are active on the same resource at different container levels, the smallest container's control is enforced first. Thus, action is taken on \fBprocess.max-cpu-time\fR before \fBtask.max-cpu-time\fR if both controls are encountered simultaneously.
