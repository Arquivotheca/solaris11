.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRThe library module filename
.sp
.LP
In the conversion library, \fB/usr/lib/iconv\fR (see \fBiconv\fR(3C)), the library module filename is composed of two symbolic elements separated by the percent sign (\fB%\fR). The first symbol specifies the code set that is being converted; the second symbol specifies the \fItarget code\fR, that is, the code set to which the first one is being converted.

.sp
.LP
In the conversion table above, the first  symbol is termed the "FROM Filename Element". The second symbol, representing the target code set, is the "TO Filename Element".

.sp
.LP
For example, the library module filename to convert from the \fIKorean\fR \fIEUC\fR code set to the \fIKorean\fR \fIUTF-8\fR code set is

.sp
.LP
\fBko_KR-euc%ko_KR-UTF-8\fR
