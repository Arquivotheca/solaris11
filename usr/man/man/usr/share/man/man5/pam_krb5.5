.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- authentication, account, session, and password management PAM modules for Kerberos V5
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/lib/security/pam_krb5.so.1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Kerberos V5 service module for \fBPAM\fR provides functionality for all four \fBPAM\fR modules: authentication, account management, session management, and password management. The service module is a shared object that can be dynamically loaded to provide the necessary functionality upon demand. Its path is specified in the \fBPAM\fR configuration file.
.SS "Kerberos Authentication Module"
.sp
.LP
The Kerberos V5 authentication component provides functions to verify the identity of a user, \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR, and to manage the Kerberos credentials cache, \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR authenticates a user principal through the Kerberos authentication service. If the authentication request is successful, the authentication service sends a ticket-granting ticket (\fBTGT\fR) back to the service module, which then verifies that the \fBTGT\fR came from a valid Key Distribution Center (\fBKDC\fR) by attempting to get a service ticket for the local host service. For this to succeed, the local host's \fBkeytab\fR file (\fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR) must contain the entry for the local host service. For example, in the file \fBhost/\fIhostname.com\fR@\fIREALM\fR\fR, \fIhostname.com\fR is the fully qualified local hostname and \fIREALM\fR is the default realm of the local host as defined in \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.conf\fR. If the host entry is not found in the keytab file, the authentication fails. Administrators can optionally disable this "strict" verification by setting "\fBverify_ap_req_nofail = false\fR" in \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.conf\fR. See \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) for more details on this option. This allows \fBTGT\fR verification to succeed in the absence of a \fBkeytab\fR host principal entry. 
.sp
.LP
If \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR is called and the \fBpkinit\fR module option is set, the Kerberos V5 authentication module tries to do \fBPKINIT\fR authentication, assuming that both the system and the \fBKDC\fR are configured to support this type of authentication. This form of authentication uses a user's certificate and private key to acquire the user's initial Kerberos credential (\fBTGT\fR). One of the keystore formats supported is \fBPKCS11\fR which supports use of any \fBPKCS11\fR compatible keystore capable of storing the required credential and private key needed for \fBPKINIT\fR authentication (\fBPKCS11\fR compatible smartcards are an example). See \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) for more details on \fBPKINIT\fR configuration. This form of authentication is typically useful for services where the system on which the \fBauth\fR stack is being processed has access to the user's certificate and private key.
.sp
.LP
If \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR is called and the \fBpkinit\fR module option is not set then the Kerberos V5 authentication module does password based authentication.
.sp
.LP
In either case, if the \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR password item has been set when \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR is called, which is the case when \fBpam_krb5\fR is stacked after \fBpam_authtok_get\fR in the \fBauth\fR stack, the Kerberos V5 authentication module uses that \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR password for either \fBPKINIT\fR or password based Kerberos authentication.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBPAM_USER\fR item is not set \fBpam_krb5\fR with the \fBpkinit\fR option prompts for and set that item.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR password item has not been set when \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR is called, which is the case when \fBpam_krb5\fR is stacked before \fBpam_authtok_get\fR in the \fBauth\fR stack, and the \fBpkinit\fR option is present the Kerberos V5 authentication module allows the Kerberos \fBpkinit preauth\fR plugin to prompt for whatever information is needed to perform \fBPKINIT\fR (typically this is for the user's PIN). No PAM items are set by way of this prompting. See \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) for more information on \fBPKINIT\fR configuration options.
.sp
.LP
If it is desirable to initially have the Kerberos V5 authentication module try \fBPKINIT\fR Kerberos authentication and fall back to password based Kerberos authentication then either the sufficient or optional control flags must be provided for the instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR with the \fBpkinit\fR module option set and another instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR without the \fBpkinit\fR module option must be stacked below \fBpam_authtok_get\fR. If there are PAM modules other than \fBpam_krb5\fR that must be evaluated below \fBpam_authtok_get\fR then the control flag should be set to optional for the instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR with the \fBpkinit\fR module option set otherwise the control flag should be set to sufficient.
.sp
.LP
Only two instances of \fBpam_krb5\fR are supported in a \fBauth\fR stack.
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_sm_authenticate\fR(3PAM) can be passed the following flag:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This flag is ignored. The Kerberos authentication mechanism does not allow an empty password string by default.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR creates and modifies the user's credential cache. This function initializes the user's credential cache, if it does not already exist, and stores the initial credentials for later use by Kerberos network applications. The following flags can be set in the flags field. They are best described by their effect on the user's credential cache.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_ESTABLISH_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Stores the initial credentials in the user's credential cache so that the user can access Kerberos network services. If a successful authentication pass was made, the new credentials are stored in the credential cache, overwriting any existing credentials that were previously stored. If an unsuccessful authentication pass was made, \fBPAM_CRED_UNAVAIL\fR is returned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DELETE_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This flag has no effect on the credential cache and always returns \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR. The credential cache is not deleted because there is no accurate method to determine if the credentials are needed by another process. The credential cache can be deleted with the \fBkdestroy\fR(1) command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Deletes the user's existing credential cache, if it exists, and creates a new credential cache. The new credentials are stored in the new cache and the user's ticket lifetime and renewable life time values are reset.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_REFRESH_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Does not require a previous authentication pass, but if a successful one is made, the new credentials are stored in the credential cache. If a previous authentication pass was not made or was unsuccessful, an attempt to renew the existing credentials is made. This function fails if the user's renewable ticket lifetime is expired.

.rt  
Turns off warning messages. Also, does not query KDC for impending password expiration information used to warn the user.
.RE

.SS "Kerberos V5 Session Management Module"
.sp
.LP
The Kerberos V5 session management component provides functions to initiate \fBpam_sm_open_session()\fR and terminate \fBpam_sm_close_session()\fR Kerberos sessions. For Kerberos V5, both \fBpam_sm_open_session\fR and \fBpam_sm_close_session()\fR are null functions, returning \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR.
.SS "Kerberos V5 Password Management Module"
.sp
.LP
The Kerberos V5 password management component provides a function to change passwords, \fBpam_sm_chauthtok()\fR, in the Key Distribution Center (\fBKDC\fR) database. 
.sp
.LP
If the Kerberos V5 authentication module used \fBPKINIT\fR authentication in the auth stack then the Kerberos V5 password management module returns \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR in the following cases:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The new password is NULL.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The old password is NULL.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Verification of the old password fails.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The rationale behind this is that the \fBKDC\fR can not allow a \fBPKINIT\fR user to change/set a password since the user can be expected to use \fBPKINIT\fR only. If all of the cases above are false the Kerberos V5 password management module tries to change the user's password in the \fBKDC\fR database.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBKDC\fR only supports \fBPKINIT\fR authentication then the Kerberos V5 password management module should not be present in any password stacks. 
.sp
.LP
Related to \fBPKINIT\fR the Kerberos V5 password management module does not support changing the key store PIN used to access a user's private key and certificate.
.sp
.LP
The following flags can be passed to \fBpam_sm_chauthtok\fR(3PAM):
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The password service should only update the user's Kerberos password if it is expired. Otherwise, this function returns \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR. The default behaviour is to always change the user's Kerberos password.
.RE

These changes should not be made to the existing \fBkrlogin\fR, \fBkrsh\fR, and \fBktelnet\fR service entries.

\fBExample 8 \fRAuthenticating Users Through Kerberos PKINIT as a Requirement
.sp
.LP
The following example allows users to login using their \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR password acquired by \fBpam_authtok_get\fR.  This password is used by \fBpam_krb5\fR to try \fBPKINIT\fR authentication and is also used by \fBpam_unix_auth\fR to authenticate the user using the user's Unix account.  If \fBPKINIT\fR requires a password/PIN that differs from the user's Unix password then \fBpam_krb5\fR must be stacked above \fBpam_authtok_get\fR.

\fBExample 9 \fRAuthenticating Users Through Kerberos PKINIT with a Fall Back to Password-based \fBkrb auth\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example allows users to acquire a Kerberos credential using \fBPKINIT\fR authentication or using password based authentication if \fBPKINIT\fR fails.  If \fBPKINIT\fR succeeds the user is not prompted for their password.  If \fBpam_krb5 PKINIT\fR succeeds, the second instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR does not try password authentication and returns success. If \fBPKINIT\fR fails the user is prompted for their Kerberos password.

The following example allows users to acquire a Kerberos credential using \fBPKINIT\fR authentication or using password based authentication if \fBPKINIT\fR fails. If \fBpam_krb5\fR \fBPKINIT\fR succeeds, the second instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR does not try password authentication and returns ignore.  If \fBpam_krb5\fR \fBPKINIT\fR fails the second instance of \fBpam_krb5\fR tries password based authentication and return success or failure.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in \fBlibpam\fR(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multi-threaded application uses its own \fBPAM\fR handle.
