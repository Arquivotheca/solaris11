.SH NAME
pam_tsol_account \- PAM account management module for Trusted Extensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/pam_tsol_account.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Solaris Trusted Extensions service module for \fBPAM\fR, \fB/usr/lib/security/pam_tsol_account.so.1\fR, checks account limitations that are related to labels. The \fBpam_tsol_account.so.1\fR module is a shared object that can be dynamically loaded to provide the necessary functionality upon demand. Its path is specified in the \fBPAM\fR configuration file.
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_tsol_account.so.1\fR contains a function to perform account management, \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt()\fR. The function checks for the allowed label range for the user.  The allowable label range is set by the defaults in the \fBlabel_encodings\fR(4) file. These defaults can be overridden by entries in the \fBuser_attr\fR(4) database.
.sp
.LP
By default, this module requires that remote hosts connecting to the  global zone must have a CIPSO host type. To disable this policy, add the \fBallow_unlabeled\fR keyword as an option to the entry in \fBpam.conf\fR(4), as in:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
other  account required    pam_tsol_account allow_unlabeled
.fi
.in -2
.sp
