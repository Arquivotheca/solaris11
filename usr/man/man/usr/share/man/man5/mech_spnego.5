.SH NAME
mech_spnego \- Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/lib/gss/mech_spnego.so.1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The SPNEGO security mechanism for \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR allows \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR applications to negotiate the actual security mechanism to be used in the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR session. \fBmech_spnego.so.1\fR is a shared object module that is dynamically opened by applications that specify the SPNEGO Object Identifier (\fBOID\fR) in calls to the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR functions (see \fBlibgss\fR(3LIB)).
.sp
.LP
SPNEGO is described by IETF RFC 2478 and is intended to be used in environments where multiple \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI \fRmechanisms are available to the client or server and neither side knows what mechanisms are supported by the other.
.sp
.LP
When SPNEGO is used, it selects the list of mechanisms to advertise by reading the \fBGSS\fR mechanism configuration file, \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR (see \fBmech\fR(4)), and by listing all active mechanisms except for itself.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
SPNEGO may be configured to function in two ways. The first way is to interoperate with Microsoft SSPI clients and servers that use the Microsoft "\fBNegotiate\fR" method, which is also based on SPNEGO. The Microsoft "\fBNegotiate\fR" mechanism does not strictly follow the IETF RFC. Therefore, use special handling in order to enable full interoperability. In order to interoperate, place option "\fB[ msinterop ]\fR" at the end of the SPNEGO line in \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR.
.sp
.LP
This is an example (from \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR):      
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBspnego	1.3.6.1.5.5.2	mech_spnego.so	[ msinterop ]\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Without the "\fB[ msinterop ]\fR" option, \fBmech_spnego\fR will follow the strict IETF RFC 2478 specification and will not be able to negotiate with Microsoft applications that try to use the SSPI "\fBNegotiate\fR" mechanism.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
\fBmech_spnego.so.1\fR has no public interfaces. It is only activated and used through the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR interface provided by \fBlibgss.so.1\fR (see \fBlibgss\fR(3LIB)).
