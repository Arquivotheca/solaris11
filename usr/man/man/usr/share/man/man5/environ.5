.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When a process begins execution, one of the \fBexec\fR family of functions makes available an array of strings called the environment; see \fBexec\fR(2). By convention, these strings have the form \fIvariable=value\fR, for example, \fBPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin\fR. These environmental variables provide a way to make information about a program's environment available to programs.
.sp
.LP
A name can be placed in the environment by the \fBexport\fR command and \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR arguments in \fBsh\fR(1), or by one of the \fBexec\fR functions. It is unwise to conflict with certain shell variables such as \fBMAIL\fR, \fBPS1\fR, \fBPS2\fR, and \fBIFS\fR that are frequently exported by \fB\&.profile\fR files; see \fBprofile\fR(4). 
.sp
.LP
The following environmental variables can be used by applications and are expected to be set in the target run-time environment.

\fB\fBHOME\fR\fR

\fB\fBLANG\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The string used to specify internationalization information that allows users to work with different national conventions. The \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) function checks the \fBLANG\fR environment variable when it is called with \fB""\fR as the \fBlocale\fR argument. \fBLANG\fR is used as the default locale if the corresponding environment variable for a particular category is unset or null. If, however, \fBLC_ALL\fR is set to a valid, non-empty value, its contents are used to override both the \fBLANG\fR and the other \fBLC_*\fR variables. For example, when invoked as \fBsetlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")\fR, \fBsetlocale()\fR queries the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR environment variable first to see if it is set and non-null. If \fBLC_CTYPE\fR is not set or null, then \fBsetlocale()\fR checks the \fBLANG\fR environment variable to see if it is set and non-null. If both \fBLANG\fR and \fBLC_CTYPE\fR are unset or \fINULL\fR, the default C locale is used to set the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category.
.sp
Most commands invoke \fBsetlocale(LC_ALL, "")\fR prior to any other processing. This allows the command to be used with different national conventions by setting the appropriate environment variables.

The following environment variables correspond to each category of \fBsetlocale\fR(3C):

This category specifies character classification, character conversion, and widths of multibyte characters. When \fBLC_CTYPE\fR is set to a valid value, the calling utility can display and handle text and file names containing valid characters for that locale; Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters where any individual character can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes wide; and EUC characters of 1, 2, or 3 column widths. The default C locale corresponds to the 7-bit \fBASCII\fR character set; only characters from ISO 8859-1 are valid. The information corresponding to this category is stored in a database created by the \fBlocaledef()\fR command. This environment variable is used by \fBctype\fR(3C), \fBmblen\fR(3C), and many commands, such as \fBcat\fR(1), \fBed\fR(1), \fBls\fR(1), and \fBvi\fR(1).

A colon-separated list of network identifiers. A network identifier is a character string used by the Network Selection component of the system to provide application-specific default network search paths. A network identifier must consist of non-null characters and must have a length of at least 1. No maximum length is specified. Network identifiers are normally chosen by the system administrator. A network identifier is also the first field in any \fB/etc/netconfig\fR file entry. \fBNETPATH\fR thus provides a link into the \fB/etc/netconfig\fR file and the information about a network contained in that network's entry. \fB/etc/netconfig\fR is maintained by the system administrator. The library routines described in \fBgetnetpath\fR(3NSL) access the \fBNETPATH\fR environment variable.

Contains a sequence of templates which \fBcatopen\fR(3C) and \fBgettext\fR(3C) use when attempting to locate message catalogs. Each template consists of an optional prefix, one or more substitution fields, a filename and an optional suffix. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
NLSPATH="/system/nlslib/%N.cat"

defines that \fBcatopen()\fR should look for all message catalogs in the directory \fB/system/nlslib\fR, where the catalog name should be constructed from the \fIname\fR parameter passed to \fBcatopen\fR(\|), \fB%N\fR, with the suffix \fB\&.cat\fR.

An empty string is substituted if the specified value is not currently defined. The separators "\fB_\fR" and "\fB\&.\fR" are not included in \fB%t\fR and \fB%c\fR substitutions.
.sp
Templates defined in \fBNLSPATH\fR are separated by colons (\fB:\fR). A leading colon or two adjacent colons (\fB::\fR) is equivalent to specifying \fB%N\fR. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
NLSPATH=":%N.cat:/nlslib/%L/%N.cat"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

indicates to \fBcatopen()\fR that it should look for the requested message catalog in \fIname\fR, \fIname\fR\fB\&.cat\fR and \fB/nlslib/$LANG/\fR\fIname\fR.cat. For \fBgettext()\fR, \fB%N\fR automatically maps to \fBmessages\fR.
.sp
If \fBNLSPATH\fR is unset or \fINULL\fR, \fBcatopen()\fR and \fBgettext()\fR call \fBsetlocale\fR(3C), which checks \fBLANG\fR and the \fBLC_*\fR variables to locate the message catalogs.
.sp
The extended interpretation of %L in Solaris includes the support for accepted locale name aliases as described in gettext(1), \fBgettext\fR(3C), \fBcatopen\fR(3C), \fBsetlocale\fR(3C), and \fBlocale_alias\fR(5).

\fBNLSPATH\fR is normally be set up on a system wide basis (in \fB/etc/profile\fR) and thus makes the location and naming conventions associated with message catalogs transparent to both programs and users.

Timezone information. The contents of this environment variable are used by the functions \fBctime\fR(3C), \fBlocaltime\fR(3C), \fBstrftime\fR(3C), and \fBmktime\fR(3C) to override the default timezone. The value of \fBTZ\fR has one of the two formats (spaces inserted for clarity):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
:characters
.fi
.in -2

or
.sp
.in +2
.nf
std offset dst offset, rule
.fi
.in -2

If \fBTZ\fR is of the first format (that is, if the first character is a colon (:)), or if \fBTZ\fR is not of the second format, then \fBTZ\fR designates a path to a timezone database file relative to \fB/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/\fR, ignoring a leading colon if one exists.
.sp
Otherwise, \fBTZ\fR is of the second form, which when expanded is as follows:
.sp
.in +2

Indicate no less than three, nor more than {\fBTZNAME_MAX\fR}, bytes that are the designation for the standard (\fIstd\fR) or the alternative (\fIdst\fR, such as Daylight Savings Time) timezone. Only \fIstd\fR is required; if \fIdst\fR is missing, then the alternative time does not apply in this timezone. Each of these fields can occur in either of two formats, quoted or unquoted:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
In the quoted form, the first character is the less-than ('<') character and the last character is the greater-than ('>') character. All characters between these quoting characters are alphanumeric characters from the portable character set in the current locale, the plus-sign ('+') character, or the minus-sign ('-') character. The \fIstd\fR and \fIdst\fR fields in this case do not include the quoting characters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
In the unquoted form, all characters in these fields are alphabetic characters from the portable character set in the current locale.
.RE
The interpretation of these fields is unspecified if either field is less than three bytes (except for the case when \fIdst\fR is missing), more than {\fBTZNAME_MAX\fR} bytes, or if they contain characters other than those specified.

The minutes (\fImm\fR) and seconds (\fIss\fR) are optional. The hour (\fIhh\fR) is required and can be a single digit. The \fIoffset\fR following \fIstd\fR is required. If no \fIoffset\fR follows \fIdst\fR, daylight savings time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time. One or more digits can be used. The value is always interpreted as a decimal number. The hour must be between 0 and 24, and the minutes (and seconds), if present, must be between 0 and 59. Out of range values can cause unpredictable behavior. If preceded by a \fB-\fR, the time zone is east of the Prime Meridian. Otherwise, it is west of the Prime Meridian (which can be indicated by an optional preceding "\fI+\fR" sign).
