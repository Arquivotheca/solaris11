.SH NAME
pam_ldap \- authentication and account management PAM module for LDAP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/pam_ldap.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_ldap\fR module implements \fBpam_sm_authenticate\fR(3PAM) and \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM), the functions that provide functionality for the PAM authentication and account management stacks. The \fBpam_ldap\fR module ties the authentication and account management functionality to the functionality of the supporting LDAP server. For authentication, \fBpam_ldap\fR can authenticate the user directly to any LDAP directory server by using any supported authentication mechanism, such as \fBDIGEST-MD5\fR. However, the account management component of \fBpam_ldap\fR will work only with the Sun Java System Directory Server. The server's user account management must be properly configured before it can be used by \fBpam_ldap\fR. Refer to the \fISun Java System Directory Server Administration Guide\fR for information on how to configure user account management, including password and account lockout policy.
.sp
.LP
\fBpam_ldap\fR must be used in conjunction with the modules that support the UNIX authentication, password, and account management, which are \fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5), \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5), \fBpam_unix_account\fR(5), and \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5). \fBpam_ldap\fR is designed to be stacked directly below these modules. If other modules are designed to be stacked in this manner, the modules can be stacked below the \fBpam_ldap\fR module. The Examples section shows how the UNIX modules are stacked with \fBpam_ldap\fR. When stacked together, the UNIX modules are used to control local accounts, such as \fBroot\fR. \fBpam_ldap\fR is used to control network accounts, that is, LDAP users. For the stacks to work, \fBpam_unix_auth\fR, \fBpam_unix_account\fR, and \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR must be configured with the \fBbinding\fR control flag and the \fBserver_policy\fR option. This configuration allows local account override of a network account.
.SS "LDAP Authentication Module"
.sp
.LP
The LDAP authentication module verifies the identity of a user. The \fBpam_sm_authenticate\fR(3PAM) function uses the password entered by the user to attempt to authenticate to the LDAP server. If successful, the user is authenticated. See NOTES for information on password prompting.
.sp
.LP
The authentication method used is either defined in the client profile , or the authentication method is configured by using the \fBldapclient\fR(1M) command. To determine the authentication method to use, this module first attempts to use the authentication method that is defined, for service \fBpam_ldap\fR, for example, \fBserviceAuthenticationMethod:pam_ldap:sasl/DIGEST-MD5\fR. If no authentication method is defined, \fBpam_ldap\fR uses the default authentication method. If neither are set, the authentication fails. This module skips the configured authentication method if the authentication method is set to \fBnone\fR.

.SS "LDAP Account Management Module"
.sp
.LP
The LDAP account management module validates the user's account. The \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM) function authenticates to the LDAP server to verify that the user's password has not expired, or that the user's account has not been locked. In the event that there is no user authentication token (\fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR) available, the \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM) function attempts to retrieve the user's account status without authenticating to the LDAP server as the user logging in. This procedure will succeed only if the LDAP server is Sun Java System Directory server 5.2 patch 4 or newer. The following options can be passed to the LDAP service module:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdebug\fR\fR

.SS "LDAP Password Management Module"
.sp
.LP
LDAP password management is no longer supported by \fBpam_ldap\fR. Use \fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5) instead of \fBpam_ldap\fR for password change. \fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5) handles both the local and LDAP accounts and updates the passwords in all the repositories configured by \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in \fBlibpam\fR(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multi-threaded application uses its own \fBPAM\fR handle.
.sp
.LP
The previously supported \fBuse_first_pass\fR and \fBtry_first_pass\fR options are obsolete in this version, are no longer needed, can safely be removed from \fBpam.conf\fR(4), and are silently ignored. They might be removed in a future release. Password prompting must be provided for by stacking \fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5) before \fBpam_ldap\fR in the \fBauth\fR and \fBpassword\fR module stacks and \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5) in the \fBpasswd\fR service \fBauth\fR stack (as described in the EXAMPLES section). The previously supported password update function is replaced in this release by the previously recommended use of \fBpam_authtok_store\fR with the \fBserver_policy\fR option (as described in the EXAMPLES section).
.sp
.LP
The functions: \fBpam_sm_setcred\fR(3PAM), \fBpam_sm_chauthtok\fR(3PAM), \fBpam_sm_open_session\fR(3PAM), and \fBpam_sm_close_session\fR(3PAM) do nothing and return \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR in \fBpam_ldap\fR.
