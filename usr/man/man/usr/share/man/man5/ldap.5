.SH NAME
ldap \- LDAP as a naming repository
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
LDAP refers to Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is an industry standard for accessing directory servers. By initializing the client using \fBldapclient\fR(1M) and using the keyword \fBldap\fR in the name service switch file, \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR, Oracle Solaris clients can obtain naming information from an LDAP server. Information such as usernames, hostnames, and passwords are stored on the LDAP server in a Directory Information Tree or \fBDIT\fR. The \fBDIT\fR consists of entries which in turn are composed of attributes. Each attribute has a type and one or more values.
.sp
.LP
Oracle Solaris LDAP clients use the LDAP v3 protocol to access naming information from LDAP servers. The LDAP server must support the object classes and attributes defined in \fIRFC2307bis (draft)\fR, which maps the naming service model on to LDAP. As an alternate to using the schema defined in \fIRFC2307bis (draft)\fR, the system can be configured to use other schema sets and the schema mapping feature is configured to map between the two. Refer to the \fIOracle Solaris Administration: Naming and Directory Services\fR for more details.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility can make an Oracle Solaris machine an LDAP client by setting up the appropriate directories, files, and configuration information. The LDAP client caches this configuration information in local cache files. This configuration information is accessed through the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR(1M) daemon. This daemon also refreshes the information in the configuration files from the LDAP server, providing better performance and security. The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR must run at all times for the proper operation of the naming services.
.sp
.LP
There are two types of configuration information, the information available through a profile, and the information configured per client. The profile contains all the information as to how the client accesses the directory. The credential information for proxy user is configured on a per client basis and is not downloaded through the profile.
.sp
.LP
The profile contains server-specific parameters that are required by all clients to locate the servers for the desired LDAP domain. This information could be the server's IP address and the search base Distinguished Name (DN), for instance. It is configured on the client from the default profile during client initialization and is periodically updated by the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR daemon when the expiration time has elapsed.
.sp
.LP
Client profiles can be stored on the LDAP server and can be used by the \fBldapclient\fR utility to initialize an LDAP client. Using the client profile is the easiest way to configure a client machine. See \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Credential information includes client-specific parameters that are used by a client. This information could be the Bind DN (LDAP "login" name) of the client and the password. If these parameters are required, they are manually defined during the initialization through \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The naming information is stored in containers on the LDAP server. A container is a non-leaf entry in the DIT that contains naming service information. Containers are similar to maps in NIS. A default mapping between the NIS databases and the containers in LDAP is presented below. The location of these containers as well as their names can be overridden through the use of \fBserviceSearchDescriptors\fR. For more information, see \fBldapclient\fR(1M).

The security model for clients is defined by a combination of the credential level to be used, the authentication method, and the PAM modules to be used. The credential level defines what credentials the client should use to authenticate to the directory server, and the authentication method defines the method of choice. Both these can be set with multiple values. The Oracle Solaris LDAP supports the following values for credential level :
.br
.in +2
\fBanonymous\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBproxy\fR
.in -2

\fBself\fR

When the credential level is configured as \fBself\fR, DNS must be configured and the authentication method must be \fBsasl/GSSAPI\fR. The \fBhosts\fR and \fBipnodes\fR in \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR must be configured to use DNS, for example \fBhosts: dns files\fR and \fBipnodes: dns files\fR. 
.sp
.LP
\fBsasl/GSSAPI\fR automatically uses \fBGSSAPI\fR confidentiality and integrity options, if they are configured on the directory server.
.sp
.LP
The credential level of \fBself\fR enables per-user naming service lookups, or lookups that use the \fBGSSAPI\fR credentials of the user when connecting to the directory server. Currently the only \fBGSSAPI\fR mechanism supported in this model is Kerberos V5. Kerberos must be configured before you can use this credential level. See \fBkerberos\fR(5) for details.
.sp
.LP
More protection can be provided by means of access control, allowing the server to grant access for certain containers or entries. Access control is specified by Access Control Lists (ACLs) that are defined and stored in the LDAP server. The Access Control Lists on the LDAP server are called Access Control Instructions (ACIs) by the the SunOne Directory Server. Each ACL or ACI specifies one or more directory objects, for example, the \fBcn\fR attribute in a specific container, one or more clients to whom you grant or deny access, and one or more access rights that determine what the clients can do to or with the objects. Clients can be users or applications. Access rights can be specified as read and write, for example. Refer to the \fIOracle Solaris Administration: Naming and Directory Services\fR regarding the restrictions on ACLs and ACIs when using LDAP as a naming repository.

A sample \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) file called \fBnsswitch.ldap\fR is provided in the \fB/etc\fR directory. This is copied to \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR by the \fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility. This file uses LDAP as a repository for the different databases in the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR file.
