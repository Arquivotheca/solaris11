.SH NAME
pam_list \- PAM account management module for UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
 pam_list.so.1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_list\fR module implements \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM), which provides  functionality to the PAM account management stack.  The module provides functions to validate  that  the  user's account  is  valid on this host based on a list of users and/or netgroups in the given file. The users and netgroups are separated by newline character. Netgroups are specified with character '@' as prefix before name of netgroup in the list. The maximum line length is 1023 characters.
.sp
.LP
The username is the value of \fBPAM_USER\fR. The host is the value of \fBPAM_RHOST\fR or, if \fBPAM_RHOST\fR is not set, the value of the localhost as returned by \fBgethostname\fR(3C) is used.
.sp
.LP
If neither of the \fBallow\fR, \fBdeny\fR, or \fBcompat\fR options are specified, the module will look for +/- entries in the local \fB/etc/passwd\fR file.  If this style is used, \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) must not be configured with \fBcompat\fR for the \fBpasswd\fR database. If no relevant +/- entry exists for the user, \fBpam_list\fR is not participating in result.
.sp
.LP
If \fBcompat\fR option is specified then the module will look for +/- entries in the local \fB/etc/passwd\fR file. Other entries in this file will be counted as + entries. If no relevant entry exits for the user, \fBpam_list\fR will deny the access.

\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBpam_list\fR in default mode
.sp

\fB/etc/pam.conf\fR modification looks like:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
other   account requisite       pam_roles.so.1

.LP
In the case of \fBdefault\fR mode or \fBcompat\fR mode, the important lines in \fB/etc/passwd\fR appear as follows:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
+loginname	- user is approved
-loginname	- user is disapproved
+@netgroup	- netgroup members are approved
