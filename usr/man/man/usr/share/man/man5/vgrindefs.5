.SH NAME
vgrindefs \- vgrind's language definition data base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/vgrindefs\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBvgrindefs\fR contains all language definitions for \fBvgrind\fR(1). Capabilities in \fBvgrindefs\fR are of two types: Boolean capabilities which indicate that the language has some particular feature and string capabilities which give a regular expression or keyword list. Entries may continue onto multiple lines by giving a \e as the last character of a line. Lines starting with # are comments.
.SS "Capabilities"
.sp
.LP
The following table names and describes each capability.

.SS "Regular Expressions"
.sp
.LP
\fBvgrindefs\fR uses regular expressions similar to those of \fBex\fR(1) and \fBlex\fR(1). The characters `^', `$', `:', and `\e' are reserved characters and must be `quoted' with a preceding \e if they are to be included as normal characters. The metasymbols and their meanings are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB$\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
The end of a line
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB^\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
The beginning of a line
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\ed\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
A delimiter (space, tab, newline, start of line)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB\ea\fR\fR

\fB\fB\ep\fR\fR

.rt  
Matches any identifier. In a procedure definition (the `pb' capability) the string that matches this symbol is used as the procedure name.

Preceding any string means that the string will not match an input string if the input string is preceded by an escape character (\e). This is typically used for languages (like C) that can include the string delimiter in a string by escaping it.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Unlike other regular expressions in the system, these match words and not characters. Hence something like `(tramp|steamer)flies?' would match `tramp', `steamer', `trampflies', or `steamerflies'. Contrary to some forms of regular expressions, \fBvgrindef\fR alternation binds very tightly. Grouping parentheses are likely to be necessary in expressions involving alternation.
.SS "Keyword List"
.sp
.LP
The keyword list is just a list of keywords in the language separated by spaces. If the `oc' boolean is specified, indicating that upper and lower case are equivalent, then all the keywords should be specified in lower case.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRA sample program.
.sp
.LP
The following entry, which describes the C language, is typical of a language entry.

.sp
.in +2

Note that the first field is just the language name (and any variants of it). Thus the C language could be specified to \fBvgrind\fR(1) as `c' or `C'.
