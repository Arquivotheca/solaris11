size, Nblock, blksize, device-nblocks, device-blksize \- device size properties
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A driver can communicate size information to the system by the values associated with following properties. Size information falls into two categories: device size associated with a \fBdev_info_t\fR node, and minor node size associated with a \fBddi_create_minor_node\fR(9F) \fBdev_t\fR (partition).

.sp
.LP
A driver that implements both block and character minor device nodes should support both "Size" and "Nblocks". Typically, the following is true: Size = \fBNblocks\fR * \fBblksize\fR.
.sp
.LP
A driver where all ddi_create_minor_node(9F) calls for a given instance are associated with the same physical block device should implement "\fBdevice-nblocks\fR". If the device has a fixed block size with a value other than \fBDEV_BSIZE\fR then "\fBdevice-blksize\fR" should be implemented.
.sp
.LP
The driver is responsible for ensuring that property values are updated when device, media, or partition sizes change. For each represented item, if its size is know to be zero, the property value should be zero. If its size is unknown, the property should not be defined.
.sp
.LP
A driver may choose to implement size properties within its prop_op(9E) implementation. This reduces system memory since no space is used to store the properties.
.sp
.LP
The DDI property interfaces deal in signed numbers. All Size(9P) values should be considered unsigned. It is the responsibility of the code dealing with the property value to ensure that an unsigned interpretation occurs.
