.SH NAME
no-involuntary-power-cycles \- device property to prevent involuntary power cycles
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A device that might be damaged by power cycles should export the boolean (zero length) property \fBno-involuntary-power-cycles\fR to notify the system that all power cycles for the device must be under the control of the device driver.
.sp
.LP
The presence of this property prevents power from being removed from a device or any ancestor of the device while the device driver is detached, unless the device was voluntarily powered off as a result of the device driver calling \fBpm_lower_power\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
The presence of \fBno-involuntary-power-cycles\fR also forces attachment of the device driver during a CPR suspend operation and prevents the suspend from taking place, unless the device driver returns \fBDDI_SUCCESS\fR when its \fBdetach\fR(9E) entry point is called with \fBDDI_SUSPEND\fR.
.sp
.LP
The presence of \fBno-involuntary-power-cycles\fR does not prevent the system from being powered off due to a \fBhalt\fR(1M) or \fBuadmin\fR(1M) invocation, except for CPR suspend.
.sp
.LP
This property can be exported by a device that is not power manageable, in which case power is not removed from the device or from any of its ancestors, even when the driver for the device and the drivers for its ancestors are detached.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUse of Property in Driver's Configuration File
.sp
.LP
The following is an example of a \fBno-involuntary-power-cycles\fR entry in a driver's \fB\&.conf\fR file:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
no-involuntary-power-cycles=1;
     ... 
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRUse of Property in \fBattach()\fR Function
.sp
.LP
The following is an example of how the preceding \fB\&.conf\fR file entry would be implemented in the \fBattach\fR(9E) function of a driver:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
xxattach(dev_info_t *dip, ddi_attach_cmd_t cmd)
  {
   ...
       if (ddi_prop_create(DDI_DEV_T_NONE, dip, DDI_PROP_CANSLEEP,
           "no-involuntary-power-cycles", NULL, 0) != DDI_PROP_SUCCESS)
            goto failed;
   ...
   }
.fi
.in -2
