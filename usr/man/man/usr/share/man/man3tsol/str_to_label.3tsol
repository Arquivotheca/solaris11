.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstr_to_label()\fR function is a simple function to parse human readable strings into labels of the requested type.
.sp
.LP
The \fIstring\fR argument is the string to parse. If \fIstring\fR is the result of a \fBlabel_to_str()\fR conversion of type \fBM_INTERNAL\fR, \fIflags\fR are ignored, and any previously parsed label is replaced.
.sp
.LP
If *\fIlabel\fR is \fINULL\fR, \fBstr_to_label()\fR allocates resources for \fIlabel\fR and initializes the label to the \fIlabel_type\fR that was requested before parsing \fIstring\fR.
.sp
.LP
If *\fIlabel\fR is not \fINULL\fR, the label is a pointer to a mandatory label that is the result of a previously parsed label and \fIlabel_type\fR is ignored. The type that is used for parsing is derived from \fIlabel\fR for any type-sensitive operations.
.sp
.LP
If \fIflags\fR is \fBL_MODIFY_EXISTING\fR, the parsed string can be used to modify this label.
.sp
.LP
If \fIflags\fR is \fBL_NO_CORRECTION\fR, the previously parsed label is replaced and the parsing algorithm does not attempt to infer missing elements from string to compose a valid label.
.sp
.LP
If \fIflags\fR is \fBL_DEFAULT\fR, the previously parsed label is replaced and the parsing algorithm makes a best effort to imply a valid label from the elements of \fIstring\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIflags\fR contains \fBL_CHECK_AR\fR logically OR-ed with another value, the resulting label will be checked to ensure that it is within the "Accreditation Range" of the DIA encodings schema. This flag is interpreted only for \fBMAC_LABEL\fR label types.
.sp
.LP
The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated resources by calling the \fBm_label_free()\fR function. \fIlabel_type\fR defines the type for a newly allocated label. The label type can be:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBMAC_LABEL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The string should be translated as a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) label.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBUSER_CLEAR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The string should be translated as a label that represents the least upper bound of the labels that the user is allowed to access.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If \fIerror\fR is \fINULL\fR, do not return additional error information for \fBEINVAL\fR. The calling process must have mandatory read access to \fIlabel\fR and human readable \fIstring\fR. Or the calling process must have the \fBsys_trans_label\fR privilege.
.sp
.LP
The manifest constants \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR and \fBADMIN_LOW\fR are the human readable strings that correspond to the Trusted Extensions policy \fBadmin_high\fR and \fBadmin_low\fR label values. See \fBlabels\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBstr_to_label()\fR function returns 0. Otherwise, \fB-1\fR is returned, \fIerrno\fR is set to indicate the error, and \fIerror\fR provides additional information for \fBEINVAL\fR. Otherwise, \fIerror\fR is a zero-based index to the string parse failure point.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBstr_to_label()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Invalid parameter. \fBM_BAD_STRING\fR indicates that \fIstring\fR could not be parsed. \fBM_BAD_LABEL\fR indicates that the label passed in was in error. \fBM_OUTSIDE_AR\fR indicates that the resulting label is not within the "Accreditation Range" specified in the DIA encodings schema.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTSUP\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The system does not support label translations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR

.RS 11n

The physical limits of the system are exceeded by size bytes of memory which cannot be allocated.

Parsing types that are relative to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) encodings schema are Standard. Standard is specified in \fBlabel_encodings\fR(4).

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
A number of the parsing rules rely on the DIA label encodings schema. The rules might not be valid for other label schemata.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the system is configured with Trusted Extensions.
