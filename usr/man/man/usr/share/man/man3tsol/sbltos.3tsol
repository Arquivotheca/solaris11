.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions translate binary labels into canonical strings that are clipped to the number of printable characters specified in \fIlen\fR. Clipping is required if the number of characters of the translated string is greater than \fIlen\fR. Clipping is done by truncating the label on the right to two characters less than the specified number of characters. A clipped indicator, "<\(mi", is appended to sensitivity labels and clearances. The character-coded label begins with a classification name separated with a single space character from the list of words making up the remainder of the label. The binary labels must be of the proper defined type and dominated by the process's sensitivity label. A \fIlen\fR of 0 (zero) returns the entire string with no clipping.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsbsltos()\fR function translates a binary sensitivity label into a clipped string using the long form of the words and the short form of the classification name. If \fIlen\fR is less than the minimum number of characters (three), the translation fails.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsbcleartos()\fR function translates a binary clearance into a clipped string using the long form of the words and the short form of the classification name. If \fIlen\fR is less than the minimum number of characters (three), the translation fails. The translation of a clearance might not be the same as the translation of a sensitivity label. These functions use different tables of the \fBlabel_encodings\fR file which might contain different words and constraints.
.sp
.LP
The calling process must have \fBPRIV_SYS_TRANS_LABEL\fR in its set of effective privileges to perform label translation on labels that dominate the current process's sensitivity label.
.SS "Process Attributes"
.sp
.LP
If the \fBVIEW_EXTERNAL\fR or \fBVIEW_INTERNAL\fR flags are not specified, translation of \fBADMIN_LOW\fR and \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR labels is controlled by the label view process attribute flags. If no label view process attribute flags are defined, their translation is controlled by the label view configured in the \fBlabel_encodings\fR file. A value of External specifies that \fBADMIN_LOW\fR and \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR labels are mapped to the lowest and highest labels defined in the \fBlabel_encodings\fR file. A value of Internal specifies that the \fBADMIN_LOW\fR and \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR labels are translated to the \fBadmin low name\fR and \fBadmin high name\fR strings specified in the \fBlabel_encodings\fR file. If no such names are specified, the strings "\fBADMIN_LOW\fR" and "\fBADMIN_HIGH\fR" are used.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These functions return a pointer to a statically allocated string that contains the result of the translation, or \fB(char\fR \fB*)0\fR if the translation fails for any reason.

.SS "\fBsbcleartos()\fR"
.sp
.LP
Assume that a clearance is:

.LP
These functions are obsolete and retained for ease of porting. They might be removed in a future Solaris Trusted Extensions release. Use the \fBlabel_to_str\fR(3TSOL) function instead.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
All these functions share the same statically allocated string storage. They are not MT-Safe. Subsequent calls to any of these functions will overwrite that string with the newly translated string.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the system is configured with Trusted Extensions.
