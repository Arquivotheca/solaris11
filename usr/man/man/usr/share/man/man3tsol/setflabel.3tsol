\fBint\fR \fBsetflabel\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR, \fBconst m_label_t *\fR\fIlabel_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file that is named by \fIpath\fR is relabeled by moving it to a new pathname relative to the root directory of the zone corresponding to \fIlabel_p\fR. If the source and destination file systems are loopback mounted from the same underlying file system, the file is renamed. Otherwise, the file is copied and removed from the source directory.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetflabel()\fR function enforces the following policy checks:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the sensitivity label of \fIlabel_p\fR equals the existing sensitivity label, then the file is not moved.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the corresponding directory does not exist in the destination zone, or if the directory exists, but has a different label than \fIlabel_p\fR, the file is not moved. Also, if the file already exists in the destination directory, the file is not moved.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the sensitivity label of the existing file is not equal to the calling process label and the caller is not in the global zone, then the file is not moved. If the caller is in the global zone, the existing file label must be in a labeled zone (not \fBADMIN_LOW\fR or \fBADMIN_HIGH\fR).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the calling process does not have write access to both the source and destination directories, then the calling process must have \fBPRIV_FILE_DAC_WRITE\fR in its set of effective privileges.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the sensitivity label of \fIlabel_p\fR provides read only access to the existing sensitivity label (an upgrade), then the user must have the \fBsolaris.label.file.upgrade\fR authorization. In addition, if the current zone is a labeled zone, then it must have been assigned the privilege \fBPRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL\fR when the zone was configured.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the sensitivity label of \fIlabel_p\fR does not provide access to the existing sensitivity label (a downgrade), then the calling user must have the \fBsolaris.label.file.downgrade\fR authorization. In addition, if the current zone is a labeled zone, then it must have been assigned the privilege \fBPRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL\fR when the zone was configured.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the calling process is not in the global zone, and the user does not have the \fBsolaris.label.range\fR authorization, then \fIlabel_p\fR must be within the user's label range and within the system accreditation range.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If the existing file is in use (not tranquil) it is not moved. This tranquility check does not cover race conditions nor remote file access.
.RE

.LP
Additional policy constraints can be implemented by customizing the shell script \fB/etc/security/tsol/relabel\fR. See the comments in this file.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBsetflabel()\fR returns 0. Otherwise it returns -1 and sets \fIerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetflabel()\fR function fails and the file is unchanged if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of \fIpath\fR.
.sp
The calling process does not have mandatory write access to the final component of path because the sensitivity label of the final component of path does not dominate the sensitivity label of the calling  process and the calling process does not have \fBPRIV_FILE_MAC_WRITE\fR in its set of effective privileges.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
