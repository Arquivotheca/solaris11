.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
With the \fBscr_dump()\fR routine, the current contents of the virtual screen are written to the file \fIfilename\fR.
.sp
.LP
With the \fBscr_restore()\fR routine, the virtual screen is set to the contents of \fIfilename\fR, which must have been written using \fBscr_dump()\fR. The next call to \fBdoupdate()\fR restores the screen to the way it looked in the dump file.
.sp
.LP
With the \fBscr_init()\fR routine, the contents of \fIfilename\fR are read in and used to initialize the \fBcurses\fR data structures about what the terminal currently has on its screen. If the data is determined to be valid, \fBcurses\fR bases its next update of the screen on this information rather than clearing the screen and starting from scratch. \fBscr_init()\fR is used after \fBinitscr()\fR or a \fBsystem\fR(3C) call to share the screen with another process which has done a \fBscr_dump()\fR after its \fBendwin()\fR call. The data is declared invalid if the time-stamp of the tty is old or the terminfo capabilities \fBrmcup()\fR and \fBnrrmc()\fR exist.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscr_set()\fR routine is a combination of \fBscr_restore()\fR and \fBscr_init()\fR. It tells the program that the information in \fIfilename\fR is what is currently on the screen, and also what the program wants on the screen. This can be thought of as a screen inheritance function.
.sp
.LP
To read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the \fBgetwin()\fR and \fBputwin()\fR routines (see \fBcurs_util\fR(3CURSES)).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR upon success.
