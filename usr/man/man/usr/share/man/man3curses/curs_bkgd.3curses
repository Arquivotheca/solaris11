.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbkgdsets()\fR and \fBwbkgdset()\fR routines manipulate the background of the named window. Background is a \fBchtype\fR consisting of any combination of attributes and a character. The attribute part of the background is combined (ORed) with all non-blank characters that are written into the window  with \fBwaddch()\fR. Both the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with the blank characters. The background becomes a property of the character and moves with the character through any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations. To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbkgd()\fR and \fBwbkgd()\fR routines combine the new background with every position in the window. Background is any combination of attributes and a character. Only the attribute part is used to set the background of non-blank characters,  while both character and attributes are used for blank positions. To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBbkgd()\fR and \fBwbkgd()\fR return the integer \fBOK\fR, or a non-negative integer, if \fBimmedok()\fR is set. See \fBcurs_outopts\fR(3CURSES).
