.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBunctrl()\fR macro expands to a character string which is a printable representation of the character \fIc\fR. Control characters are displayed in the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation. Printing characters are displayed as is.
.sp
.LP
With the \fBkeyname()\fR routine, a character string corresponding to the key \fIc\fR is returned.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfilter()\fR routine, if used, is called before \fBinitscr()\fR or \fBnewterm()\fR are called. It makes \fBcurses\fR think that there is a one-line screen. \fBcurses\fR does not use any terminal capabilities that assume that they know on what line of the screen the cursor is positioned.
.sp
.LP
The \fBuse_env()\fR routine, if used, is called before \fBinitscr()\fR or \fBnewterm()\fR are called. When called with \fBFALSE\fR as an argument, the values of \fBlines\fR and \fBcolumns\fR specified in the \fIterminfo\fR database will be used, even if environment variables \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR (used by default) are set, or if \fBcurses\fR is running in a window (in which case default behavior would be to use the window size if \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR are not set).
.sp
.LP
With the \fBputwin()\fR routine, all data associated with window \fIwin\fR is written into the file to which \fIfilep\fR points. This information can be later retrieved using  the \fBgetwin()\fR function.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetwin()\fR routine reads window related data stored in the file by \fBputwin()\fR. The routine then creates and initializes a new window using that data. It returns a pointer to the new window.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdelay_output()\fR routine inserts an \fIms\fR millisecond pause in output. This routine should not be used extensively because padding characters are used rather than a \fBCPU\fR pause.
.sp
.LP
The \fBflushinp()\fR routine throws away any typeahead that has been typed by the user and has not yet been read by the program.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Except for \fBflushinp()\fR, routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value other than \fBERR\fR upon successful completion.
.sp
.LP
\fBflushinp()\fR always returns \fBOK\fR.
.sp
.LP
Routines that return pointers return \fINULL\fR on error.
