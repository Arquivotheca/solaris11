.SH NAME
panels \- character based panels package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <panel.h>\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpanel\fR library is built using the \fBcurses\fR library, and any program using \fBpanels\fR routines must call one of the \fBcurses\fR initialization routines such as \fBinitscr\fR. A program using these routines must be compiled with \fB-lpanel\fR and \fB-lcurses\fR on the \fBcc\fR command line.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpanels\fR package gives the applications programmer a way to have depth relationships between \fBcurses\fR windows; a \fBcurses\fR window is associated with every panel. The \fBpanels\fR routines allow \fBcurses\fR windows to overlap without making visible the overlapped portions of underlying windows. The initial \fBcurses\fR window, \fBstdscr\fR, lies beneath all panels. The set of currently visible panels is the \fIdeck\fR of panels.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpanels\fR package allows the applications programmer to create panels, fetch and set their associated windows, shuffle panels in the deck, and manipulate panels in other ways.

.SH RETURN VALUES

.LP
Each \fBpanels\fR routine that returns a pointer to an object returns \fBNULL\fR if an error occurs. Each panel routine that returns an integer, returns \fBOK\fR if it executes successfully and \fBERR\fR if it does not.
