.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBHBA_RefreshInformation()\fR function requests that the underlying VSL reload all information about the given HBA.  This function should be called whenever any function returns \fBHBA_STATUS_ERROR_STALE_DATA\fR, or if an index that was previously valid returns \fBHBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_INDEX\fR. Because the underlying VSL can reset all indexes relating to the HBA, all old index values must be discarded by the caller.
.sp
.LP
The \fBHBA_RefreshAdapterConfiguration()\fR function updates information about the HBAs present on the system. This function does not change any of the relationships between the HBA API and adapters that have not been reconfigured.  HBA handles continue to refer to the same HBA even if it is no longer installed. The HBA name or index assigned by the library remains assigned to the same HBA even if it has been removed and reinstalled, as long as the bus position, WWN, and OS device have not changed. Adapter that have been removed and not replaced cannot have their HBA handles, HBA names, and HBA indexes reassigned. Calls to these adapters will generate \fBHBA_STATUS_ERROR_UNAVAILABLE\fR.
