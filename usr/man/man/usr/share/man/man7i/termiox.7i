.SH NAME
termiox \- extended general terminal interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The extended general terminal interface supplements the \fBtermio\fR(7I) general terminal interface by adding support for asynchronous hardware flow control, isochronous flow control and clock modes, and local implementations of additional asynchronous features. Some systems may not support all of these capabilities because of either hardware or software limitations.  Other systems may not permit certain functions to be disabled.  In these cases the appropriate bits will be ignored.  See <\fBsys/termiox.h\fR> for your system to find out which capabilities are supported.
.SS "Hardware Flow Control Modes"
.sp
.LP
Hardware flow control supplements the \fBtermio\fR(7I) \fBIXON\fR, \fBIXOFF\fR, and \fBIXANY\fR character flow control. Character flow control occurs when one device controls the data transfer of another device by the insertion of control characters in the data stream between devices.  Hardware flow control occurs when one device controls the data transfer of another device using electrical control signals on wires (circuits) of the asynchronous interface. Isochronous hardware flow control occurs when one device controls the data transfer of another device by  asserting or removing the transmit clock signals of that device.  Character flow control and hardware flow control may be simultaneously set.
.sp
.LP
In asynchronous, full duplex applications, the use of the Electronic Industries Association's EIA-232-D Request To Send (RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS) circuits is the  preferred method of hardware flow control.  An interface to other hardware flow control methods is included to provide a standard interface to these existing methods.
.sp
.LP
The EIA-232-D standard specified only unidirectional hardware flow control - the Data Circuit-terminating Equipment or Data Communications Equipment (DCE) indicates to the Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) to stop transmitting data.   The \fBtermiox\fR interface allows both unidirectional and bidirectional hardware flow control; when bidirectional flow control is enabled, either the DCE or DTE can indicate to each other to stop transmitting data across the interface.  Note: It is assumed that the asynchronous port is configured as a DTE.  If the connected device is also a DTE and not a DCE, then DTE to DTE (for example, terminal or printer connected to computer) hardware flow control is possible by using a null modem to interconnect the appropriate data and control circuits. 
.SS "Clock Modes"
.sp
.LP
Isochronous communication is a variation of asynchronous communication whereby two communicating devices may provide transmit and/or receive clock signals to one another. Incoming clock signals can be taken from the baud rate generator on the local isochronous port controller, from CCITT V.24 circuit 114, Transmitter Signal Element Timing - DCE source (EIA-232-D pin 15), or  from CCITT V.24 circuit 115, Receiver Signal Element Timing - DCE source  (EIA-232-D pin 17). Outgoing clock signals can be sent on CCITT V.24 circuit 113, Transmitter Signal Element Timing - DTE source (EIA-232-D  pin 24), on CCITT V.24 circuit 128, Receiver Signal Element Timing - DTE source (no EIA-232-D pin), or not sent at all.
.sp
.LP
In terms of clock modes, traditional asynchronous communication is implemented simply by using the local baud rate generator as the incoming transmit and receive clock source and not outputting any clock signals.
.SS "Terminal Parameters"
.sp
.LP
The parameters that control the behavior of devices providing the \fBtermiox\fR interface are specified by the \fBtermiox\fR structure defined in the <\fBsys/termiox.h\fR> header.  Several \fBioctl\fR(2) system calls that fetch or change these parameters use this structure:
.sp

.nf
#define	NFF	5
struct termiox	{
	unsigned short	x_hflag;       /* hardware flow control modes */
	unsigned short	x_cflag;       /* clock modes */
	unsigned short	x_rflag[NFF];  /* reserved modes */
	unsigned short	x_sflag;       /* spare local modes */
};

.LP
The EIA-232-D DTR and CD circuits are used to establish a connection between two systems. The RTS circuit is also used to establish a connection with a modem. Thus, both DTR and RTS are activated when an asynchronous port is opened. If DTR is used for hardware flow control, then RTS must be used for connectivity. If CD is used for hardware flow control, then CTS must be used for connectivity. Thus, RTS and DTR (or CTS and CD) cannot both be used for hardware flow control at the same time. Other mutual exclusions may apply, such as the simultaneous setting of the \fBtermio\fR(7I) \fBHUPCL\fR and the  \fBtermiox\fR \fBDTRXOFF\fR bits, which use the DTE ready line for different functions.
.sp
.LP
Variations of different hardware flow control methods may be selected by setting the the appropriate bits. For example, bidirectional RTS/CTS flow control is selected by setting both the \fBRTSXOFF\fR and \fBCTSXON\fR bits and bidirectional DTR/CTS flow control is selected by setting both the \fBDTRXOFF\fR and \fBCTSXON\fR. Modem control or unidirectional CTS hardware flow control is selected by setting only the \fBCTSXON\fR bit.
.sp
.LP
As previously mentioned, it is assumed that the local asynchronous port (for example, computer) is configured as a DTE.  If the connected device (for example,  printer) is also a DTE, it is assumed that the device is connected to the computer's asynchronous port using a null modem that swaps control circuits (typically RTS and CTS).  The connected DTE drives RTS and the null modem swaps RTS  and CTS so that the remote RTS is received as CTS by the local DTE.  In the case that \fBCTSXON\fR is set for hardware flow control, printer's lowering of its RTS would cause CTS seen by the computer to be lowered.  Output to the printer is suspended until the printer's raising of its RTS, which would cause CTS seen by the computer to be raised.
.sp
.LP
If \fBRTSXOFF\fR is set, the Request To Send (RTS) circuit (line) will be raised, and if the asynchronous port needs to have its input stopped, it will lower the Request To Send (RTS) line. If the RTS line is lowered, it is assumed that the connected device will stop its output until RTS is raised.
.sp
.LP
If \fBCTSXON\fR is set, output will occur only if the Clear To Send (CTS) circuit (line) is raised by the connected device. If the CTS line is lowered by the connected device, output is suspended until CTS is raised.
.sp
.LP
If \fBDTRXOFF\fR is set, the DTE Ready (DTR) circuit (line) will be raised, and if the asynchronous port needs to have its input stopped, it will lower the DTE Ready (DTR) line. If the DTR line is lowered, it is assumed that the connected device will stop its output until DTR is raised.
.sp
.LP
If \fBCDXON\fR is set, output will occur only if the Received Line Signal Detector (CD) circuit (line) is raised by the connected device. If the CD line is lowered by the connected device, output is suspended until CD is raised.
.sp
.LP
If \fBISXOFF\fR is set, and if the isochronous port needs to have its input stopped, it will stop the outgoing clock signal. It is assumed that the connected device is using this clock signal to create its output. Transit and receive clock sources are programmed using the \fBx_cflag\fR fields. If the port is not programmed for external clock generation, \fBISXOFF\fR is ignored.  Output isochronous flow control is supported by appropriate clock source programming using the \fBx_cflag\fR field and enabled at the remote connected device.

The \fBx_cflag\fR field specifies the system treatment of clock modes.
