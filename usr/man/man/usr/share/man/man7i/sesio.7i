.SH NAME
sesio \- enclosure services device driver interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <sys/sesio.h>\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBses\fR device driver provides the following ioctls as a means to access SCSI enclosure services devices.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBses\fR driver supports the following ioctls:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSES_IOCTL_GETSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
This ioctl obtains enclosure state in the  \fBses_ioctl\fR structure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSES_IOCTL_SETSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
This ioctl is used to set parameters on the enclosure services device. The  \fBses_ioctl\fR structure is used to pass information into the driver.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBses\fR driver was unable to obtain data from the enclosure services device or the  data transfer could not be completed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The  \fBses\fR driver does not support the requested ioctl function.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENXIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The enclosure services device does not exist.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The user specified a bad data length.

.SH STRUCTURES
.sp
.LP
The  \fBses_ioctl\fR structure has the following fields:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uint32_t;               /* Size of buffer that follows */
uint8_t page_code:      /* Page to be read/written */
uint8_t reserved[3];    /* Reserved; Set to 0 */
unit8t  buffer[1];      /* Size arbitrary, user specifies */
.fi
.in -2

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing the  \fBSES_IOCTL_GETSTATE\fR ioctl
.sp
.LP
The following example uses the  \fBSES_IOCTL_GETSTATE\fR ioctl to recover 20 bytes of page 4 from a previously opened device.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
char   abuf[30];
struct ses_ioctl *sesp;
int    status;
sesp = (ses_ioctl *)abuf;
sesp->size = 20;
sesp->page_code = 4;
status = ioctl(fd, SES_IOCTL_GETSTATE, abuf);
.fi
.in -2
