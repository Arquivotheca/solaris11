.SH NAME
dsp \- generic audio device interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include\fR \fB<sys/soundcard.h>\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
To record audio input, applications \fBopen()\fR the appropriate device and read data from it using the \fBread()\fR system call. Similarly, sound data is queued to the audio output port by using the \fBwrite\fR(2) system call. Device configuration is performed using the \fBioctl\fR(2) interface.
.sp
.LP
Because some systems can contain more than one audio device, application writers are encouraged to open the \fB/dev/mixer\fR device and determine the physical devices present on the system using the \fBSNDCTL_SYSINFO\fR and \fBSNDCTL_AUDIOINFO\fR ioctls. See \fBmixer\fR(7I). The user should be provided a the ability to select a different audio device, or alternatively, an environment variable such as \fBAUDIODSP\fR can be used. In the absence of any specific configuration from the user, the generic device file, \fB/dev/dsp\fR, can be used.  This normally points to a reasonably appropriate default audio device for the system.
.SS "Opening the Audio Device"
.sp
.LP
The audio device is not treated as an exclusive resource.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBopen()\fR completes as long as there are channels available to be allocated. If no channels are available to be allocated, the call returns \fB-1\fR with the \fBerrno\fR set to \fBEBUSY\fR.
.sp
.LP
Audio applications should explicitly set the encoding characteristics to match the audio data requirements after opening the device, and not depend on any default configuration.
.SS "Recording Audio Data"
.sp
.LP
The \fBread()\fR system call copies data from the system's buffers to the application. Ordinarily, \fBread()\fR blocks until the user buffer is filled. The \fBpoll\fR(2) system call can be used to determine the presence of data that can be read without blocking. The device can alternatively be set to a non-blocking mode, in which case \fBread()\fR completes immediately, but can return fewer bytes than requested. Refer to the \fBread\fR(2) manual page for a complete description of this behavior.
.sp
.LP
When the audio device is opened with read access, the device driver allocates resources for recording. Since this consumes system resources, processes that do not record audio data should open the device write-only (\fBO_WRONLY\fR).
.sp
.LP
The recording process can be stopped by using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_HALT_INPUT\fR ioctl, which also discards all pending record data in underlying device FIFOs.
.sp
.LP
Before changing record parameters, the input should be stopped using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_HALT_INPUT\fR ioctl, which also flushes the any underlying device input FIFOs. (This is not necessary if the process never started recording by calling \fBread\fR(2). Otherwise, subsequent reads can return samples in the old format followed by samples in the new format. This is particularly important when new parameters result in a changed sample size.
.sp
.LP
Input data can accumulate in device buffers very quickly. At a minimum, it accumulates at 8000 bytes per second for 8-bit, 8 KHz, mono, \fBu-Law\fR data. If the device is configured for more channels, higher sample resolution, or higher sample rates, it accumulates even faster. If the application that consumes the data cannot keep up with this data rate, the underlying FIFOs can become full. When this occurs, any new incoming data is lost until the application makes room available by consuming data. Additionally, a record overrun is noted, which can be retrieved using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETERROR\fR ioctl. 
.sp
.LP
Record volume for a stream can be adjusted by issuing the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_SETRECVOL\fR ioctl. The volume can also be retrieved using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETRECVOL\fR.
.SS "Playing Audio Data"
.sp
.LP
The \fBwrite()\fR system call copies data from an application's buffer to the device output FIFO. Ordinarily, \fBwrite()\fR blocks until the entire user buffer is transferred. The device can alternatively be set to a non-blocking mode, in which case \fBwrite()\fRcompletes immediately, but might have transferred fewer bytes than requested. See \fBwrite\fR(2). 
.sp
.LP
Although \fBwrite()\fR returns when the data is successfully queued, the actual completion of audio output might take considerably longer. The \fBSNDCTL_DSP_SYNC\fR ioctl can be issued to allow an application to block until all of the queued output data has been played.
.sp
.LP
The final \fBclose\fR(2) of the file descriptor waits until all of the audio output has drained. If a signal interrupts the \fBclose()\fR, or if the process exits without closing the device, any remaining data queued for audio output is flushed and the device is closed immediately.
.sp
.LP
The output of playback data can be halted entirely, by calling the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_HALT_OUTPUT\fR ioctl. This also discards any data that is queued for playback in device FIFOs.
.sp
.LP
Before changing playback parameters, the output should be drained using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_SYNC\fR ioctl, and then stopped using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_HALT_OUTPUT\fR ioctl, which also flushes the any underlying device output FIFOs. This is not necessary if the process never started playback, such as by calling \fBwrite\fR(2). This is particularly important when new parameters result in a changed sample size.
.sp
.LP
Output data is played from the playback buffers at a default rate of at least 8000 bytes per second for u-Law, A-Law or 8-bit PCM data (faster for 16-bit linear data or higher sampling rates). If the output FIFO becomes empty, the framework plays silence, resulting in audible stall or click in the output, until more data is supplied by the application. The condition is also noted as a play underrun, which can be determined using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETERROR\fR ioctl.
.sp
.LP
Playback volume for a stream can be adjusted by issuing the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_SETPLAYVOL\fR ioctl. The volume can also be retrieved using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETPLAYVOL\fR. 
.SS "Asynchronous I/O"
.sp
.LP
The \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR flag can be set using the \fBF_SETFL\fR \fBfcntl\fR(2) to enable non-blocking \fBread()\fR and \fBwrite()\fR requests. This is normally sufficient for applications to maintain an audio stream in the background.
.sp
.LP
It is also possible to determine the amount of data that can be transferred for playback or recording without blocking using the \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE\fR or \fBSNDCTL_DSP_GETISPACE\fR ioctls, respectively.
.SS "Mixer Pseudo-Device"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/dev/mixer\fR provides access to global hardware settings such as master volume settings, etc. It is also the interface used for determining the hardware configuration on the system.
.sp
.LP
Applications should \fBopen\fR(2) \fB/dev/mixer\fR, and use the \fBSNDCTL_SYSINFO\fR and \fBSNDCTL_AUDIOINFO\fR ioctls to determine the device node names of audio devices on the system. See \fBmixer\fR(7I) for additional details.
.SH IOCTLS

.sp

.na
\fB\fBSNDCTL_DSP_SYNC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
The argument is ignored. This command suspends the calling process until the output FIFOs are empty and all queued samples have been played, or until a signal is delivered to the calling process. An implicit \fBSNDCTL_DSP_SYNC\fR is performed on the final \fBclose()\fR of the \fBdsp\fR device.
.sp
This ioctl should not be used unnecessarily, as if it is used in the middle of playback it causes a small click or pause, as the FIFOs are drained. The correct use of this ioctl is just before changing sample formats.
