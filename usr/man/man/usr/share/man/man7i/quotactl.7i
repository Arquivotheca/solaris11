int ioctl(int \fIfd\fR, Q_QUOTACTL, struct quotcl *\fIqp\fR)
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This \fBioctl()\fR call manipulates disk quotas. \fIfd\fR is the file descriptor returned by the \fBopen()\fR system call after opening the \fBquotas\fR file (located in the root directory of the filesystem running quotas.) \fBQ_QUOTACTL\fR is defined in \fB/usr/include/sys/fs/ufs_quota.h\fR. \fIqp\fR is the address of the \fBquotctl\fR structure which is defined as
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct quotctl {
  int op;
  uid_t uid;
  caddr_t addr;
};
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
\fIop\fR indicates an operation to be applied to the user \fBID\fR \fIuid\fR. (See below.) \fIaddr\fR is the address of an optional, command specific, data structure which is copied in or out of the system. The interpretation of \fIaddr\fR is given with each value of \fIop\fR below.

Turn on quotas for a file system. \fIaddr\fR points to the full pathname of the \fBquotas\fR file. \fIuid\fR is ignored. It is recommended that \fIuid\fR have the value of \fB0\fR. This call is restricted to the super-user.

.SH BUGS
.sp

There should be some way to integrate this call with the resource limit interface provided by \fBsetrlimit()\fR and \fBgetrlimit\fR(2).
.sp

This call is incompatible with Melbourne quotas.
