.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBqbufcall()\fR function serves as a \fBqtimeout\fR(9F) call of indeterminate length. When a buffer allocation request fails, \fBqbufcall()\fR can be used to schedule the routine \fIfunc\fR to be called with the argument \fIarg\fR when a buffer becomes available. \fIfunc\fR may call \fBallocb()\fR or it may do something else.
.sp
.LP
The \fBqbufcall()\fR function is tailored to be used with the enhanced \fBSTREAMS \fRframework interface, which is based on the concept of perimeters. (See \fBmt-streams\fR(9F).) \fBqbufcall()\fR schedules the specified function to execute after entering the perimeters associated with the queue passed in as the first parameter to \fBqbufcall()\fR. All outstanding timeouts and bufcalls must be cancelled (using, respectively, \fBquntimeout\fR(9F) and \fBqunbufcall\fR(9F)) before a driver close routine can block and before the close  routine calls \fBqprocsoff\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
\fBqprocson\fR(9F) must be called before calling either \fBqbufcall()\fR or \fBqtimeout\fR(9F).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBqbufcall()\fR function returns a \fBqbufcall\fR \fBID\fR that can be used in a call to \fBqunbufcall\fR(9F) to cancel the request. If the \fBqbufcall()\fR scheduling fails, \fIfunc\fR is never called and \fB0\fR is returned.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBqbufcall()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
Even when \fIfunc\fR is called by \fBqbufcall()\fR, \fBallocb\fR(9F) can fail if another module or driver had allocated the memory before \fIfunc\fR was able to call \fBallocb\fR(9F).
