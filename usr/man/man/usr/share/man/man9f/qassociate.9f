.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBqassociate()\fR function must be used by \fBDLPI\fR style 2 device drivers to manage the association between STREAMS queues and device instances. The \fBgld\fR(7D) does this automatically on behalf of drivers based on it. It is recommended that the \fBgld\fR(7D) be used for network device drivers whenever possible.
.sp
.LP
The \fBqassociate()\fR function associates the specified STREAMS queue with the specified instance of the bottom driver in the queue. Upon successful return, the stream is associated with the instance with any prior association dissolved.
.sp
.LP
A DLPI style 2 driver calls \fBqassociate()\fR while processing the \fBDL_ATTACH_REQ\fR message. The driver is also expected to call this interface while performing stream associations through other means, such as \fBndd\fR(1M) ioctl commands.
.sp
.LP
If \fIinstance\fR is -1, the stream is left unassociated with any hardware instance.
.sp
.LP
If the interface returns failure, the stream is not associated with the specified instance. Any prior association is left untouched.
.sp
.LP
The interface typically fails because of failure to locate and attach the device instance. The interface never fails if the specified instance is -1.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBqassociate()\fR function can be called from the stream's \fBput\fR(9E) entry point. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp

\fB\fB0\fR\fR

Success.

Failure.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
DLPI style 2 network driver \fBDL_ATTACH_REQ\fR code specifies:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
if (qassociate(q, instance) != 0)
                goto fail;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The association prevents Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR) from detaching the instance.
.sp
.LP
DLPI style 2 network driver \fBDL_DETACH\fR code specifies:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
(void) qassociate(q, -1);
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This dissolves the queue's association with any device instance.
.sp
.LP
DLPI style 2 network driver \fBopen\fR(9E) code must call:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
qassociate(q, -1);
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This informs the framework that this driver has been modified to be DDI-compliant.
