.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBput()\fR calls the put procedure ( \fBput\fR(9E) entry point) for the STREAMS queue specified by \fIq\fR, passing it the message block referred to by \fImp\fR. It is typically used by a driver or module to call its own put procedure.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBput()\fR can be called from a STREAMS module or driver put or service routine, or from an associated interrupt handler, timeout, bufcall, or esballoc call-back. In the latter cases, the calling code must guarantee the validity of the \fIq\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
Since \fBput()\fR may cause re-entry of the module (as it is intended to do), mutexes or other locks should not be held across calls to it, due to the risk of single-party deadlock (\fBput\fR(9E), \fBputnext\fR(9F), \fBputctl\fR(9F), \fBqreply\fR(9F)). This function is provided as a DDI/DKI conforming replacement for a direct call to a put procedure.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The caller cannot have the stream frozen when calling this function. See  \fBfreezestr\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
DDI/DKI conforming modules and drivers are no longer permitted to call put procedures directly, but must call through the appropriate STREAMS utility function, for example, \fBput\fR(9E), \fBputnext\fR(9F), \fBputctl\fR(9F), and \fBqreply\fR(9F). This function is provided as a DDI/DKI conforming replacement for a direct call to a put procedure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBput()\fR and \fBputnext()\fR functions should be called only after \fBqprocson()\fR is finished.
