.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBcopyin()\fR copies data from a user program source address to a driver buffer.  The driver developer must ensure that adequate space is allocated for the destination address.
.sp
.LP
Addresses that are word-aligned are moved most efficiently.  However, the driver developer is not obligated to ensure alignment.  This function automatically finds the most efficient move according to address alignment.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Under normal conditions, a \fB0\fR is returned indicating a successful copy.  Otherwise, a \(mi\fB1\fR is returned if one of the following occurs:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Paging fault; the driver tried to access a page of memory for which it did not have read or write access.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Invalid user address, such as a user area or stack area.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Invalid address that would have resulted in data being copied into the user block.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Hardware fault; a hardware error prevented access to the specified user memory. For example, an uncorrectable parity or \fBECC\fR error occurred. 
.RE
.sp
.LP
If a \(mi\fB1\fR is returned to the caller, driver entry point routines should return \fBEFAULT\fR. 
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBcopyin()\fR can be called from user context only.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAn \fBioctl()\fR Routine
.sp
.LP
A driver \fBioctl\fR(9E) routine (line 10) can be used to get or set device attributes or registers. In the \fBXX_GETREGS\fR condition (line 17), the driver copies the current device register values to a user data area (line 18).  If the specified argument contains an invalid address, an error code is returned.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Driver writers who intend to support layered ioctls in their \fBioctl\fR(9E) routines should use \fBddi_copyin\fR(9F) instead.
.sp
.LP
Driver defined locks should not be held across calls to this function.
.sp
.LP
\fBcopyin()\fR should not be used from a streams driver. See \fBM_COPYIN\fR and \fBM_COPYOUT\fR in \fISTREAMS Programming Guide\fR.
