.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_dma_nextwin()\fR function shifts the current \fBDMA\fR window \fIwin\fR within the object referred to by \fIhandle\fR to the next \fBDMA\fR window \fInwin\fR. If the current window is \fINULL\fR, the first window within the object is returned. A \fBDMA\fR window is a portion of a \fBDMA\fR object or might be the entire object. A \fBDMA\fR window has system resources allocated to it and is prepared to accept data transfers. Examples of system resources are \fBDVMA\fR mapping resources and intermediate transfer buffer resources.
.sp
.LP
All \fBDMA\fR objects require a window. If the \fBDMA\fR window represents the whole \fBDMA\fR object it has system resources allocated for the entire data transfer. However, if the system is unable to setup the entire \fBDMA\fR object due to system resource limitations, the driver writer may allow the system to allocate system resources for less than the entire \fBDMA\fR object. This can be accomplished by specifying the \fBDDI_DMA_PARTIAL\fR flag as a parameter to \fBddi_dma_buf_setup\fR(9F) or \fBddi_dma_addr_setup\fR(9F) or as part of a \fBddi_dma_req\fR(9S) structure in a call to \fBddi_dma_setup\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
Only the window that has resources allocated is valid per object at any one time. The currently valid window is the one that was most recently returned from \fBddi_dma_nextwin()\fR. Furthermore, because a call to \fBddi_dma_nextwin()\fR will reallocate system resources to the new window, the previous window will become invalid. It is a \fBsevere\fR error to call \fBddi_dma_nextwin()\fR before any transfers into the current window are complete.
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_dma_nextwin()\fR function takes care of underlying memory synchronizations required to shift the window. However, if you want to access the data before or after moving the window, further synchronizations using \fBddi_dma_sync\fR(9F) are required.
.SH RETURN VALUES
