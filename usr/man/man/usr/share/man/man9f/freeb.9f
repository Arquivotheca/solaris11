Pointer to the message block to be deallocated. \fBmblk_t\fR is an instance of the \fBmsgb\fR(9S) structure.

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfreeb()\fR function deallocates a message block. If the reference count of the \fBdb_ref\fR member of the \fBdatab\fR(9S) structure is greater than \fB1\fR, \fBfreeb()\fR decrements the count. If \fBdb_ref\fR equals \fB1\fR, it deallocates the message block and the corresponding data block and buffer.
.sp
.LP
If the data buffer to be freed was allocated with the \fBesballoc\fR(9F), the buffer may be a non-STREAMS resource. In that case, the driver must be notified that the attached data buffer needs to be freed, and run its own freeing routine. To make this process independent of the driver used in the stream, \fBfreeb()\fR finds the \fBfree_rtn\fR(9S) structure associated with the buffer. The \fBfree_rtn\fR structure contains a pointer to the driver-dependent routine, which releases the buffer. Once this is accomplished, \fBfreeb()\fR releases the \fBSTREAMS\fR resources associated with the buffer.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBfreeb()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
