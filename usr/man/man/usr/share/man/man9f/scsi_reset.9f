.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_reset()\fR function asks the host adapter driver to reset the \fBSCSI \fRbus or a \fBSCSI \fRtarget as specified by \fIlevel\fR. If \fIlevel\fR equals \fBRESET_ALL\fR, the \fBSCSI\fR bus is reset. If it equals \fBRESET_TARGET\fR, \fIap\fR is used to determine the target to be reset. If it equals \fBRESET_LUN\fR, \fIap\fR is used to determine the logical unit to be reset.
.sp
.LP
When given the \fBRESET_LUN\fR level, \fBscsi_reset()\fR can return failure if the \fBLOGICAL UNIT RESET\fR message is not supported by the target device, or if the underlying HBA driver does not implement the ability to issue a \fBLOGICAL UNIT RESET\fR message.
.sp
.LP
Note that, at the point when \fBscsi_reset()\fR resets the logical unit (case \fBRESET_LUN\fR), or the target (case \fBRESET_TARGET\fR), or the bus (case \fBRESET_ALL\fR), there might be one or more command packets outstanding. That is, packets have been passed to \fBscsi_transport()\fR, and queued or possibly transported, but the commands have not been completed and the target completion routine has not been called for those packets.
.sp
.LP
The successful call to \fBscsi_reset()\fR has the side effect that any such commands currently outstanding are aborted, at which point the packets are marked with \fBpkt_reason\fR set to \fBCMD_RESET\fR, and the appropriate bit -- either \fBSTAT_BUS_RESET\fR or \fBSTAT_DEV_RESET\fR -- is set in \fBpkt_statistics\fR. Once thus appropriately marked, the aborted command packets are passed to the target driver command completion routine.
.sp
.LP
Also note that, at the moment that a thread executing \fBscsi_reset()\fR actually resets the target or the bus, it is possible that a second thread may have already called \fBscsi_transport()\fR, but not yet queued or transported its command. In this case the HBA will not yet have received the second thread's packet and this packet will not be aborted.
