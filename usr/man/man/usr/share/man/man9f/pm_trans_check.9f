.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpm_trans_check()\fR function checks if a power-cycle is currently advised based on data in the \fBpm_trans_data\fR  structure. This function is provided to prevent damage to devices from excess power cycles; drivers for devices that are sensitive to the number of power cycles should call \fBpm_trans_check()\fR from their \fBpower\fR(9E) function before powering-off a device. If \fBpm_trans_check()\fR indicates that the device should not be power cycled, the driver should not attempt to power cycle the device and should fail the call to \fBpower\fR(9E) entry point. 
.sp
.LP
If \fBpm_trans_check()\fR returns that it is not advised to power cycle the device, it attempts to calculate when the  next power cycle is advised, based on the supplied parameters. In such case, \fIintervalp\fR returns the time difference (in seconds) from the current time to when the next power cycle is advised. If the time for the next power cycle cannot be determined, \fIintervalp\fR indicates \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
To avoid excessive calls to the \fBpower\fR(9E) entry point during a period when power cycling is not advised, the driver should mark the corresponding device component busy for the  \fIintervalp\fR time period (if interval is not 0). Conveniently, the driver can utilize the fact that calls to \fBpm_busy_component\fR(9F) are stacked. If power cycling is not advised, the driver can call \fBpm_busy_component\fR(9F)  and issue a \fBtimeout\fR(9F) for the \fIintervalp\fR time. The \fBtimeout()\fR handler can issue the corresponding \fBpm_idle_component\fR(9F) call. 
.sp
.LP
The format field of \fBpm_trans_data\fR accepts either \fBDC_SCSI_FORMAT\fR or \fBDC_SMART_FORMAT\fR. If the caller provides information from a SCSI Log Page, it should set the format field to \fBDC_SCSI_FORMAT\fR, and provide  valid data in \fIsvc_date\fR[], \fIlifemax\fR, \fIncycles\fR and \fIflag\fR in the \fBpm_scsi_cycles\fR structure. If the caller provides information from a SMART feature attribute, it should set the format field to \fBDC_SMART_FORMAT\fR and provide valid data in \fIallowed\fR, \fIusedup\fR and \fIflag\fR in the \fBpm_smart_count\fR structure, where \fIallowed\fR indicates the normalized cycle count before reaching the borderline threshold cycle count, and \fIusedup\fR indicates the normalized consumed cycle count. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIflag\fR field in both \fBpm_scsi_cycles\fR and \fBpm_smart_count\fR structures is reserved for future use and must be set to 0.
