.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function registers a client with Card Services and returns a unique client handle for the client. The client handle must be passed to \fBcsx_DeregisterClient\fR(9F) when the client terminates.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.sp

The structure members of \fBclient_reg_t\fR are:

If either of these bits is set, the client will receive a \fBCS_EVENT_REGISTRATION_COMPLETE\fR event when Card Services has completed its internal client registration processing and after a sucessful call to \fBcsx_RequestSocketMask\fR(9F). 
.sp
Also, if either of these bits is set, and if a card of the type that the client can control is currently inserted in the socket (and after a successful call to \fBcsx_RequestSocketMask\fR(9F)), the client will receive an artificial \fBCS_EVENT_CARD_INSERTION\fR event.

This field is bit-mapped and specifies the client's global event mask. Card Services performs event notification based on this field. See \fBcsx_event_handler\fR(9E) for valid event definitions and for additional information about handling events.

The \fBclient_data\fR field may be used to provide data available to the event handler (see \fBcsx_event_handler\fR(9E)). Typically, this is the client driver's soft state pointer.

This field contains the specific Card Services version number that the client expects to use. Typically, the client will use the \fBCS_VERSION\fR macro to specify to Card Services which version of Card Services the client expects.
