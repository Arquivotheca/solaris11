.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBqunbufcall()\fR function cancels a pending \fBqbufcall()\fR request. The argument \fIid\fR is a non-zero identifier of the request to be cancelled. \fIid\fR is returned from the \fBqbufcall()\fR function used to issue the cancel request.
.sp
.LP
The \fBqunbufcall()\fR function is tailored to be used with the enhanced \fBSTREAMS \fRframework interface which is based on the concept of perimeters. (See \fBmt-streams\fR(9F).) \fBqunbufcall()\fR returns when the bufcall has been cancelled or finished executing. The bufcall will be cancelled even if it is blocked at the perimeters associated with the queue. All outstanding timeouts and bufcalls must be cancelled before a driver close routine can block and before the close  routine calls \fBqprocsoff\fR(9F).
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBqunbufcall()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
