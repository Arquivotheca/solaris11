.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsi_ifsetcap()\fR function is used by target drivers to set the capabilities of the host adapter driver. The \fIcap\fR pointer is a name-value pair identified by a null-terminated character string and the integer value of the \fIcap\fR. The current value of the capability can be retrieved with the \fBscsi_ifgetcap()\fR function. If the \fIwhom\fR value is \fB0\fR, all target drivers are affected. Otherwise, the \fBscsi_address\fR structure pointed to by \fIap\fR is the only target that is affected.
.sp
.LP
The driver should confirm that \fBscsi_ifsetcap()\fR and \fBscsi_ifsetcap()\fR functions are called with a \fIcap\fR that points to a capability which is supported by the device.

The following capabilities have been defined:
.sp

\fB\fBdma-max\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdma-max-arch\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Maximum \fBdma\fR transfer size that is supported by system. Takes the host adapter and system architecture into account. This is useful for target drivers which do not support partial \fBDMA\fRs on systems which do not have an \fBIOMMU\fR. In this case, the \fBDMA\fR can also be limited by the host adapters "scatter/gather" list constraints.
.sp
The "\fBdma-max-arch\fR" capability can not be set. It is implemented with this command and does not rely on a \fBtran_getcap\fR(9E) response from the HBA.

\fB\fBsector-size\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Capability that is set by the target driver to inform the \fBHBA\fR of the granularity, in bytes, of the \fBDMA\fR breakup. The \fBHBA\fR \fBDMA\fR limit structure is set to reflect the byte total of this setting. See \fBddi_dma_lim_sparc\fR(9S) or \fBddi_dma_lim_x86\fR(9S). The \fBsector-size\fR should be set to the size of the physical disk sector. The capability defaults to 512 bytes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBtotal-sectors\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Capability that is set by the target driver to inform the \fBHBA\fR of the total number of sectors on the device returned by the \fBSCSI\fR \fBget capacity\fR command. This capability must be set before the target driver ``gets'' the \fBgeometry\fR capability.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBgeometry\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Capability that returns the \fBHBA\fR geometry of a target disk. The target driver sets the \fBtotal-sectors\fR capability before ``getting'' the geometry capability. The geometry is returned as a 32-bit value. The upper 16 bits represent the number of heads per cylinder. The lower 16 bits represent the number of sectors per track. The geometry capability cannot be ``set''.
.sp
If geometry is not relevant or appropriate for the target disk, \fBscsi_ifgetcap()\fR can return \fB-1\fR to indicate that the geometry is not defined. For example, if the \fBHBA\fR BIOS supports Logical Block Addressing for the target disk, \fBscsi_ifgetcap()\fR returns \fB-1\fR. Attempts to retrieve the "virtual geometry" from the target driver, such as the \fBDKIOCG_VIRTGEOM\fR ioctl, will fail. See \fBdkio\fR(7I) for more information about \fBDKIOCG_VIRTGEOM\fR.

\fB\fBqfull-retries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Capability that enables or disables \fBQUEUE\fR \fBFULL\fR handling. If \fB0\fR, the \fBHBA\fR will not retry a command when a \fBQUEUE\fR \fBFULL\fR status is returned. If the value is greater than \fB0\fR, the \fBHBA\fR driver retries the command a specified number of times at an interval determined by the \fBqfull-retry-interval\fR. The range for \fBqfull-retries\fR is \fB0-255\fR.

\fB\fBlun-reset\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Capability that is created with a value of zero by \fBHBA\fR drivers that support the \fBRESET_LUN\fR flag in the \fBtran_reset\fR(9E) function. If it exists, the \fBlun-reset\fR value can be set to \fB1\fR by target drivers to allow the use of \fBLOGICAL UNIT RESET\fR on a specific target instance. If \fBlun-reset\fR does not exist or has a value of zero, \fBscsi_reset\fR(9F) is prevented from passing the \fBRESET_LUN\fR flag to \fBtran_reset()\fR function of the \fBHBA\fR driver. If \fBlun-reset\fR exists and has a value of \fB1\fR, the \fBtran_reset()\fR function of the \fBHBA\fR driver can be called with the \fBRESET_LUN\fR flag.

Capability held in the \fBtran_interconnect_type\fR element of struct \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR that indicates the \fBHBA\fR transport interconnect type . The integer value of the interconnect type of the transport is defined in the \fBservices.h\fR header file.

\fB\fBmax-cdb-length\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
.rt  
Host adapter capability of the maximum supported \fBCDB\fR (Command Descriptor Block) length. The target driver asks for the capability at attach time. If the \fBHBA\fR driver supports the capability, the maximum length of the \fBCDB\fR is returned in bytes. The target driver can then use that value to determine which \fBCDB\fR is used for the \fBHBA\fR.
.sp
If the \fBHBA\fR driver does not support the \fBmax-cdb-length\fR capability, the default value of the target driver is used for the \fBCDB\fR determination.
