.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBldi_prop_exists()\fR checks for the existence of a property associated with a device represented by the layered driver handle, regardless of the property value data type.
.sp
.LP
Properties are searched for based on the dip and dev_t values associated with the layered handle, and the property name. This  association is handled by the layered driver infrastructure on behalf of the consumers of \fBldi_prop_exists()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The property search order is as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Search software-properties created by the driver.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Search the software properties created by the system (or nexus nodes in the device info tree).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Search the driver global properties list.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
If DDI_PROP_NOTPROM is not set, search the PROM properties (if they exist).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
If DDI_PROP_DONTPASS is not set, pass this request to the parent device information node of the device  represented by the layered handle.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
6.
Return \fB0\fR if not found and \fB1\fR if found.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Typically, the specific dev_t value associated with the device represented by the layered handle (ldi_handle_t) is used as a part of the property match criteria. This association is handled by the layered driver infrastructure on behalf of the consumers of the ldi property look up functions.
.sp
.LP
However, if the LDI_DEV_T_ANY flag is used, the ldi property lookup functions will match the request regardless of the dev_t value associated with the property at the time of its creation.  If a property was created with a dev_t set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE, the only way to look up this property is with the LDI_DEV_T_ANY flag.  PROM properties are always created with a dev_t set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE.
.sp
.LP
name must always be set to the name of the property being looked up.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBldi_prop_exists()\fR returns \fB1\fR if the property exists and \fB0\fR otherwise.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
.SH EXAMPLE

The following example demonstrates the use of ldi_prop_exists().

     /* Determine the existence of the "interrupts" property */
       ldi_prop_exists(lh, LDI_DEV_T_ANY|DDI_PROP_NOTPROM, "interrupts");
