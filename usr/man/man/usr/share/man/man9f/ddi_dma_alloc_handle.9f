.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBddi_dma_alloc_handle()\fR allocates a new  \fBDMA\fR handle. A  \fBDMA\fR handle is an opaque object used as a reference to subsequently allocated  \fBDMA\fR resources.   \fBddi_dma_alloc_handle()\fR accepts as parameters the device information referred to by  \fIdip\fR and the device's  \fBDMA\fR attributes described by a \fBddi_dma_attr\fR(9S) structure. A successful call to \fBddi_dma_alloc_handle()\fR fills in the value pointed to by  \fIhandlep\fR. A  \fBDMA\fR handle must only be used by the device for which it was allocated and is only valid for one  I/O transaction at a time.
.sp
.LP
The callback function, \fIcallback\fR, indicates how a caller wants to handle the possibility of resources not being available. If  \fIcallback\fR is set to \fBDDI_DMA_DONTWAIT\fR, then the caller does not care if the allocation fails, and can handle an allocation failure appropriately. If  \fIcallback\fR is set to  \fBDDI_DMA_SLEEP\fR, then the caller wishes to have the allocation routines wait for resources to become available. If any other value is set, and a \fBDMA\fR resource allocation fails, this value is assumed to be a function to call at a later time when resources may become available. When the specified function is called, it is passed \fIarg\fR as an argument. The specified callback function must return either \fBDDI_DMA_CALLBACK_RUNOUT\fR or \fBDDI_DMA_CALLBACK_DONE\fR. \fBDDI_DMA_CALLBACK_RUNOUT\fR indicates that the callback routine attempted to allocate \fBDMA\fR resources but failed to do so, in which case the callback function is put back on a list to be called again later.  \fBDDI_DMA_CALLBACK_DONE\fR indicates either success at allocating \fBDMA\fR resources or the driver no longer wishes to retry.
.sp
.LP
The callback function is called in interrupt context. Therefore, only system functions that are accessible from interrupt context  is available. The callback function must take whatever steps necessary to protect its critical resources, data structures, queues, and so forth.
.sp
.LP
When a  \fBDMA\fR handle is no longer needed, \fBddi_dma_free_handle\fR(9F) must be called to free the handle.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBddi_dma_alloc_handle()\fR can be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context, except when \fIcallback\fR is set to  \fBDDI_DMA_SLEEP\fR, in which case it can be called from user or kernel context only.
