.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_inject()\fR function provides an interface to allow delivery of network layer (layer 3) packets either into the kernel or onto the network. The method of delivery is determined by style.
.sp
.LP
If \fBNI_QUEUE_IN\fR is specified, the packet is scheduled for delivery up into the kernel, imitating its reception by a network interface. In this mode, \fBpacket->ni_addr\fR is ignored and \fB packet->ni_physical\fR  specifies the interface for which the packet is made to appear as if it arrived on.
.sp
.LP
If \fBNI_QUEUE_OUT\fR is specified, the packet is scheduled for delivery out of the kernel, as if it were being sent by a raw socket. In this mode, \fBpacket->ni_addr\fR and \fBpacket->ni_physical\fR are both ignored.
.sp
.LP
Neither \fBNI_QUEUE_IN\fR or \fBNI_QUEUE_OUT\fR cause the packet to be immediately processed by the kernel. Instead, the packet is added to a list and a timeout is scheduled (if there are none already pending) to deliver the packet. The  call to \fBnet_inject()\fR returns once the setup has been completed, and not after the packet has been processed. The packet processing is completed on a different thread and in a different context to that of the original packet. Thus, a packet queued up using \fBnet_inject()\fR for either \fBNI_QUEUE_IN\fR or \fBNI_QUEUE_OUT\fR is presented to the packet event again. A packet received by a hook from \fBNH_PHYSICAL_IN\fR and then queued up with \fBNI_QUEUE_IN\fR is seen by the hook as another \fBNH_PHYSICAL_IN\fR packet. This also applies to both \fBNH_PHYSICAL_OUT\fR and \fBNI_QUEUE_OUT\fR packets.
.sp
.LP
If \fBNI_DIRECT_OUT\fR is specified, an attempt is made to send the packet out to a network interface immediately. No processing on the packet, aside from prepending any required layer 2 information, is made. In this instance, \fBpacket->ni_addr\fR may be used to specify the next hop (for the purpose of link layer address resolution) and \fBpacket->ni_physical\fR determines which interface the packet should be sent out.
.sp
.LP
For all three packets, \fBpacket->ni_packet\fR must point to an \fBmblk\fR structure with the packet to be delivered.
.sp
.LP
See \fBnet_inject_t\fR(9S) for more details on the structure \fBnet_inject_t\fR.
