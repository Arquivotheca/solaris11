.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_open_by_dev()\fR, \fBldi_open_by_name()\fR and \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR functions allow a caller to open a block, character, or streams device. Upon a successful open, a layered handle to the device is returned via the layered handle pointed to by \fIlhp\fR. The ldi identifier passed to these functions is previously allocated with \fBldi_ident_from_stream\fR(9F), \fBldi_ident_from_dev\fR(9F), and \fBldi_ident_from_dip\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_open_by_dev()\fR function opens a device specified by the dev_t pointed to by devp.  Upon successful open, the caller should check the value of the dev_t to see if it has changed. (Cloning devices will change this value during opens.)   When opening a streams device, otyp must be OTYP_CHR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR function opens a device by devid. The caller must specify the minor node name to open.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_open_by_name()\fR function opens a device by pathname. Pathname is a null terminated string in the kernel address space. Pathname must be an absolute path, meaning that it must begin with '/'. The format of the pathname supplied to this function is either a \fB/devices\fR path or any other filesystem path to a device node. Opens utilizing \fB/devices\fR paths are supported before root is mounted. Opens utilizing other filesystem paths to device nodes are supported only if root is already mounted.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_close()\fR function closes a layered handle that was obtained with either \fBldi_open_by_dev()\fR, \fBldi_open_by_name()\fR, or \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR. After \fBldi_close()\fR returns the layered handle, the \fIlh\fR that was previously passed in is no longer valid.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_close()\fR function returns \fB0\fR for success. \fBEINVAL\fR is returned for invalid input parameters. Otherwise, any other error number may be returned by the device.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_open_by_dev()\fR and \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR functions return \fB0\fR upon success. If a failure occurs before the device is open, possible return values are shown below. Otherwise any other error number may be returned by the device.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
These functions may be called from user or kernel context.
.sp
.LP
These functions should not be called from a device's attach, detach, or power entry point. This could result in a system crash or deadlock.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
.LP
\fBscsi_vhci\fR(7D), \fBldi_ident_from_dev\fR(9F), \fBldi_ident_from_dip\fR(9F), \fBldi_ident_from_stream\fR(9F)
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Use only OTYP_CHR or OTYP_BLK options when you use the \fBldi_open_by_dev()\fR and \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR functions to open a device. Other flags, including OTYP_LYR, have been deprecated and should not be used with these interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The caller should be aware of cases when multiple paths to a single device may exist.  (This can occur for scsi disk devices if \fBscsi_vhci\fR(7D)) is disabled or a disk is connected to multiple controllers not supported by scsi_vhci(7D).
.sp
.LP
In these cases, \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR returns a device handle that corresponds to a  particular path to a target device. This path may not be the same across multiple calls to \fBldi_open_by_devid()\fR.  Device handles associated  with the same device but different access paths should have different filesystem device paths and dev_t values.
.sp
.LP
In the cases where multiple paths to a device exist and access to the device has not been virtualized via MPXIO (as with scsi disk devices not accessed via \fBscsi_vhci\fR(7D)), the LDI does not provide any path fail-over capabilities. If the caller wishes to do their own path management and failover they should open all available paths to a device via \fBldi_open_by_name()\fR.
