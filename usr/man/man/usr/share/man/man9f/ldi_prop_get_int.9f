.SH INTERFACE LEVEL
.sp
.LP
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_prop_get_int()\fR and \fBldi_prop_get_int64()\fR functions search for an integer property associated with a device represented by the layered driver handle. If the integer property is found, the functions return the property value.
.sp
.LP
Properties are searched for based on the dip and dev_t values associated with the layered handle, the property name, and type of the data (integer).
.sp
.LP
The property search order is as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Search software properties created by the driver.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Search the software properties created by the system (or nexus nodes in the device info tree).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Search the driver global properties list.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
If DDI_PROP_NOTPROM is not set, search the PROM properties (if they exist).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
If DDI_PROP_DONTPASS is not set, pass this request to the parent device information node of the device  represented by the layered handle.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
6.
Return defvalue.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Typically, the specific dev_t value associated with the device represented by the layered handle (ldi_handle_t) is used as a part of the property match criteria. This association is handled by the layered driver infrastructure on behalf of the consumers of the ldi property look up functions.
.sp
.LP
However, if the LDI_DEV_T_ANY flag is used, the ldi property lookup functions match the request regardless of the dev_t value associated with the property at the time of its creation. If a property was created with a dev_t set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE, the only way to look up this property is with the LDI_DEV_T_ANY flag.  PROM properties are always created with a dev_t set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE.
.sp
.LP
name must always be set to the name of the property being looked up.
.sp
.LP
The return value of the routine is the value of property. If the property is not found, the argument defvalue is returned as the property value.
.sp
.LP
\fBldi_prop_get_int64()\fR does not search the PROM for 64-bit property values.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBldi_prop_get_int()\fR and \fBldi_prop_get_int64()\fR return the property value. If the property is not found, the argument \fBdefvalue\fR is returned. If the property is found, but cannot be decoded into an int or an int64_t, DDI_PROP_NOT_FOUND is returned.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
\fBldi_prop_get_int()\fR and \fBldi_prop_get_int64()\fR can be called from user or kernel context.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Using\fB ldi_prop_get_int64()\fR.

.nf
The following example demonstrates the use of ldi_prop_get_int64().
 
       /*
        * Get the value of the integer "timeout" property, using
        * our own default if no such property exists
        */

       int64_t timeout, defval;
 
       timeout = ldi_prop_get_int64(lh, LDI_DEV_T_ANY|DDI_PROP_DONTPASS, 
           propname, defval);
