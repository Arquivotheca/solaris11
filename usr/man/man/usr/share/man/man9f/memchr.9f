.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions operate as efficiently as possible on memory areas (arrays of bytes bounded by a count, not terminated by a null character). They do not check for the overflow of any receiving memory area.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemchr()\fR function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of \fIc\fR (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR) in the first \fIn\fR bytes (each interpreted as an \fBunsigned char\fR) of memory area \fIs\fR, or a null pointer if \fIc\fR does not occur.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemcmp()\fR function compares its arguments, looking at the first \fIn\fR bytes (each interpreted as an \fBunsigned char\fR), and returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0, according as \fIs1\fR is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than \fIs2\fR when taken to be unsigned characters.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemcpy()\fR function copies \fIn\fR bytes from memory area \fIs2\fR to \fIs1\fR. It returns \fIs1\fR. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemmove()\fR function copies \fIn\fR bytes from memory area \fIs2\fR to memory area \fIs1\fR. Copying between objects that overlap will take place correctly. It returns \fIs1\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmemset()\fR function sets the first \fIn\fR bytes in memory area \fIs\fR to the value of \fIc\fR (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR). It returns \fIs\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Using \fBmemcpy()\fR might be faster than using \fBmemmove()\fR if the application knows that the objects being copied do not overlap.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
These functions can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
