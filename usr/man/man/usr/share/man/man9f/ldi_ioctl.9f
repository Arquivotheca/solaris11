.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_ioctl()\fR function passes an ioctl request to the device entry point for the device specified by the layered handle. This operation is supported for block, character, and streams devices.
.sp
.LP
If \fIarg\fR is interpreted  as a pointer (that is, as not an immediate value) and the data pointed to by \fIarg\fR is in the kernels address space, the \fBFKIOCTL\fR flag should be set. This indicates to the target driver that no data model conversion is necessary.
.sp
.LP
If the caller of \fBldi_ioctl()\fR is not the originator of the ioctl data pointed to by \fIarg\fR, (for example, when passing on an ioctl request from a user process), the caller must pass on the mode parameter from the original ioctl. This is because the mode parameter contains the contains the \fBFMODELS\fR bits that enable the target driver to determine the data model of the process which originated the ioctl and perform any necessary conversions. See \fBddi_model_convert_from\fR(9F) for more information.
.SH STREAM IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
For a general description of streams ioctls see \fBstreamio\fR(7I). \fBldi_ioctl()\fR supports a number of streams ioctls, using layered handles in the place of file descriptors. When issuing streams ioctls the \fBFKIOCTL\fR parameter should be specified. The possible return values for supported ioctl commands are also documented in \fBstreamio\fR(7I).
.sp
.LP
The following streams ioctls are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBI_PLINK\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Behaves as documented in \fBstreamio\fR(7I). The layered handle \fIlh\fR should point to the streams multiplexer. The \fIarg\fR parameter should point to a layered handle for another streams driver.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBI_UNPLINK\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Behaves as documented in \fBstreamio\fR(7I)).  The layered handle \fIlh\fR should point to the streams multiplexer. The \fIarg\fR parameter is the multiplexor ID number returned by \fBI_PLINK\fR when the streams were linked.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBldi_ioctl()\fR function returns \fB0\fR upon success. If a failure occurs before the request is passed on to the device, possible return values are shown below. Otherwise any other error number may be returned by the device.
