.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBqtimeout()\fR function schedules the specified function \fIfunc\fR to be called after a specified time interval. \fIfunc\fR is called with \fIarg\fR as a parameter. Control is immediately returned to the caller. This is useful when an event is known to occur within a specific time frame, or when you want to wait for I/O processes when an interrupt is not available or might cause problems. The exact time interval over which the timeout takes effect cannot be guaranteed, but the value given is a close approximation.
.sp
.LP
The \fBqtimeout()\fR function is tailored to be used with the enhanced \fBSTREAMS \fRframework interface which is based on the concept of perimeters. (See \fBmt-streams\fR(9F).) \fBqtimeout()\fR schedules the specified function to execute after entering the perimeters associated with the queue passed in as the first parameter to \fBqtimeout()\fR. All outstanding timeouts and bufcalls must be cancelled (using, respectively, \fBquntimeout\fR(9F) and \fBqunbufcall\fR(9F)) before a driver close routine can block and before the close  routine calls \fBqprocsoff\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
The \fBqprocson\fR(9F) function must be called before calling \fBqtimeout()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBqtimeout()\fR function returns an opaque non-zero \fBtimeout\fR identifier that can be passed to \fBquntimeout\fR(9F) to cancel the request. Note: No value is returned from the called function.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBqtimeout()\fR function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
