.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_fm_dma_err_get()\fR and \fBddi_fm_acc_err_get()\fR functions return the error status for a \fBDMA\fR or access handle, respectively. If a fault has occurred that affects the resource mapped by the supplied handle, the supplied \fIerror_status\fR structure is updated to reflect error information captured during error handling by a bus or other device driver in the \fBI/O\fR data path. When no error has occurred, \fIerror_status\fR.\fIfme_status\fR is set to \fBDDI_FM_OK\fR.
.sp
.LP
If an error is indicated for an access handle, the driver might no longer be able to access the mapped registers or memory using programmed \fBI/O\fR through the handle. Typically, this might occur after the device has failed to respond to an \fBI/O\fR access, such as in the case of a bus error or a timeout. The effect of programmed \fBI/O\fR access made at the time of a fault is undefined. Read access via \fBddi_get8\fR(9F), for example, can return random values, while write access via \fBddi_put8\fR(9F) might or might not have an effect. It is possible, however, that the error might be transient. In that case, the driver can attempt to recover by calling \fBddi_fm_acc_err_clear()\fR, resetting the device to return it to a known state, then retrying any potentially failed transactions.
.sp
.LP
If an error is indicated for a \fBDMA\fR handle, it implies that an error has been detected that has or will affect \fBDMA\fR transactions between the device and the memory currently bound to the handle, or to the memory most recently bound if the handle is currently unbound. Possible causes include the failure of a component in the \fBDMA\fR data path or an attempt by the device to make an invalid \fBDMA\fR access. The contents of any memory currently or previously bound to the handle should be considered indeterminate. The driver might be able to continue by freeing memory that is bound to the handle back to the system, resetting the device to return it to a known state, then retrying any potentially failed transactions.
.sp
.LP
If the driver is unable to recover, the operating state should be changed by a call to \fBddi_fm_service_impact()\fR that specifies \fBDDI_SERVICE_LOST\fR for the impacted device instance. If the recovery and retry succeed, a call should still be made to \fBddi_fm_service_impact()\fR but \fBDDI_SERVICE_UNAFFECTED\fR should be specified.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBddi_fm_acc_err_get()\fR and \fBddi_fm_dma_err_get()\fR functions can be called from user, kernel, or high-level interrupt context.
