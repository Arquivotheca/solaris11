.SH NAME
sendto \- send a message on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lxnet\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <sys/socket.h>

\fBssize_t\fR \fBsendto\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsocket\fR, \fBconst void *\fR\fImessage\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIlength\fR, \fBint\fR \fIflags\fR,
     \fBconst struct sockaddr *\fR\fIdest_addr\fR, \fBsocklen_t\fR \fIdest_len\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsendto()\fR function sends a message through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket.  If the socket is connectionless-mode, the message will be sent to the address specified by \fIdest_addr\fR.  If the socket is connection-mode, \fIdest_addr\fR is ignored.
.sp
.LP
If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified address is a broadcast address for the socket protocol, \fBsendto()\fR will fail if the \fBSO_BROADCAST\fR option is not set for the socket.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdest_addr\fR argument specifies the address of the target. The \fIlength\fR argument specifies the length of the message.
.sp
.LP
Successful completion of a call to \fBsendto()\fR does not guarantee delivery of the message. A return value of \fB\(mi1\fR indicates only locally-detected errors.
.sp
.LP
If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not have \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR set, \fBsendto()\fR blocks until space is available. If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does have \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR set, \fBsendto()\fR will fail.
.sp
.LP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the \fBsendto()\fR function.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The function takes the following arguments:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIflags\fR\fR

.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdest_addr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Points to a \fBsockaddr\fR structure containing the destination address.  The length and format of the address depend on the address family of the socket.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdest_len\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Specifies the length of the \fBsockaddr\fR structure pointed to by the \fIdest_addr\fR argument.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBselect\fR(3C) and \fBpoll\fR(2) functions can be used to determine when it is possible to send more data.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBsendto()\fR returns the number of bytes sent.  Otherwise, \fB-1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
