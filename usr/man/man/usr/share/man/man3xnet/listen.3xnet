.TH listen 3XNET "10 Jun 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "X/Open Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
listen \- listen for socket connections and limit the queue of incoming connections
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ... \fB-lxnet\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <sys/socket.h>

\fBint\fR \fBlisten\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsocket\fR, \fBint\fR \fIbacklog\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlisten()\fR function marks a connection-mode socket, specified by the \fIsocket\fR argument, as accepting connections, and limits the number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue to the value specified by the \fIbacklog\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
If \fBlisten()\fR is called with a \fIbacklog\fR argument value that is less than 0, the function sets the length of the socket's listen queue to 0.
.sp
.LP
The implementation may include incomplete connections in the queue subject to the queue limit. The implementation may also increase the specified queue limit internally if it includes such incomplete connections in the queue subject to this limit.
.sp
.LP
Implementations may limit the length of the socket's listen queue.  If \fIbacklog\fR exceeds the implementation-dependent maximum queue length, the length of the socket's listen queue will be set to the maximum supported value.
.sp
.LP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the \fBlisten()\fR function.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completions, \fBlisten()\fR returns 0.  Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
