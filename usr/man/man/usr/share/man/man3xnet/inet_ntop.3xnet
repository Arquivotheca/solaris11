.SH NAME
inet_ntop, inet_pton \- convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses between binary and text form
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <arpa/inet.h>

\fBconst char *\fR\fBinet_ntop\fR(\fBint\fR \fIaf\fR, \fBconst void *restrict\fR \fIsrc\fR,
     \fBchar *restrict\fR \fIdst\fR, \fBsocklen_t\fR \fIsize\fR);

\fBint\fR \fBinet_pton\fR(\fBint\fR \fIaf\fR, \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIsrc\fR, \fIdst\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBinet_ntop()\fR function converts a numeric address into a text string suitable for presentation. The \fIaf\fR argument specifies the family of the address. This can be \fBAF_INET\fR or \fBAF_INET6\fR. The \fIsrc\fR argument points to a buffer holding an IPv4 address if the \fIaf\fR argument is \fBAF_INET\fR,  or an IPv6 address if the \fIaf\fR argument is \fBAF_INET6\fR. The \fIdst\fR argument points to a buffer where the function stores the resulting text string; it cannot be \fINULL\fR. The \fIsize\fR argument specifies the size of this buffer, which must be large enough to hold the text string (\fBINET_ADDRSTRLEN\fR characters for IPv4, \fBINET6_ADDRSTRLEN\fR characters for IPv6).
.sp
.LP
The \fBinet_pton()\fR function converts an address in its standard text presentation form into its numeric binary form. The \fIaf\fR argument specifies the family of the address. The \fBAF_INET\fR and \fBAF_INET6\fR address families are supported. The \fIsrc\fR argument points to the string being passed in. The \fIdst\fR argument points to a buffer into which the function stores the numeric address; this must be large enough to hold the numeric address (32 bits for \fBAF_INET\fR, 128 bits for \fBAF_INET6\fR).
.sp
.LP
If the \fIaf\fR argument of \fBinet_pton()\fR is \fBAF_INET\fR, the \fIsrc\fR string is in the standard IPv4 dotted-decimal form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where "\fBddd\fR"is a one to three digit decimal number between 0 and 255 (see \fBinet_addr\fR(3XNET)). The \fBinet_pton()\fR function does not accept other formats (such as the octal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and fewer than four numbers that \fBinet_addr()\fR accepts).
.sp
.LP
If the \fIaf\fR argument of \fBinet_pton()\fR is \fBAF_INET6\fR, the \fIsrc\fR string is in one of the following standard IPv6 text forms:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The preferred form is "\fBx:x:x:x:x:x:x:x\fR", where the '\fBx\fR's are the hexadecimal values of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address. Leading zeros in individual fields can be omitted, but there must be at least one numeral in every field.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
A string of contiguous zero fields in the preferred form can be shown as "\fB::\fR". The "\fB::\fR" can only appear once in an address. Unspecified addresses ("\fB0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0\fR") can be represented simply as "\fB::\fR".
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
A third form that is sometimes more convenient when dealing with a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 nodes is "\fBx:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d\fR", where the '\fBx\fR's are the hexadecimal values of the six high-order 16-bit pieces of the address, and the '\fBd\fR's are the decimal values of the four low-order 8-bit pieces of the address (standard IPv4 representation).
.RE
.sp
.LP
A more extensive description of the standard representations of IPv6 addresses can be found in RFC 2373.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBinet_ntop()\fR function returns a pointer to the buffer containing the text string if the conversion succeeds. Otherwise it returns \fINULL\fR  and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBinet_pton()\fR function returns 1 if the conversion succeeds, with the address pointed to by \fIdst\fR in network byte order. It returns 0 if the input is not a valid IPv4 dotted-decimal string or a valid IPv6 address string. It returns \(mi1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to \fBEAFNOSUPPORT\fR if the \fIaf\fR argument is unknown.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBinet_ntop()\fR and \fBinet_pton()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEAFNOSUPPORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
The \fIaf\fR argument is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
The size of the \fBinet_ntop()\fR result buffer is inadequate.
