.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostent()\fR, \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR, and \fBgethostbyname()\fR functions each return a pointer to a \fBhostent\fR structure, the members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network host database.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostent()\fR function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR function searches the database and finds an entry which matches the address family specified by the \fBtype\fR argument and which matches the address pointed to by the \fIaddr\fR argument,  opening a connection to the database if necessary.  The \fIaddr\fR argument is a pointer to the binary-format (that is, not null-terminated) address in network byte order, whose length is specified by the \fIlen\fR argument.  The datatype of the address depends on the address family.  For an address of type \fBAF_INET\fR, this is an \fBin_addr\fR structure, defined in <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR>. For an address of type \fBAF_INET6\fR, there is an \fBin6_addr\fR structure defined in <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostbyname()\fR function searches the database and finds an entry which matches the host name specified by the \fIname\fR argument, opening a connection to the database if necessary. If  \fIname\fR is an alias for a valid host name, the function returns information about the host name  to which the alias refers, and  \fIname\fR is included in the list of aliases returned.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsethostent()\fR function opens a connection to the network host database, and sets the position of the next entry to the first entry.  If the \fIstayopen\fR argument is non-zero, the connection to the host database will not be closed after each call to \fBgethostent()\fR (either directly, or indirectly through one of the other \fBgethost*(\|)\fR functions).
.sp
.LP
The \fBendhostent()\fR function closes the connection to the database.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostent()\fR, \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR, and \fBgethostbyname()\fR functions may return pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
.sp
.LP
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR, \fBgethostbyname()\fR and \fBgethostent()\fR return a pointer to a \fBhostent\fR structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.  Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
.sp
.LP
On unsuccessful completion, \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR and \fBgethostbyname()\fR functions set \fIh_errno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined for \fBendhostent()\fR, \fBgethostent()\fR and \fBsethostent()\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR and \fBgethostbyname()\fR functions will fail in the following cases, setting \fIh_errno\fR to the value shown in the list below.  Any changes to \fBerrno\fR are unspecified.
