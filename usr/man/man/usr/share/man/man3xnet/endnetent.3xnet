.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetnetbyaddr()\fR, \fBgetnetbyname()\fR and \fBgetnetent()\fR, functions each return a pointer to a \fBnetent\fR structure, the members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network database.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetnetent()\fR function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetnetbyaddr()\fR function searches the database from the beginning, and finds the first entry for which the address family specified by \fBtype\fR matches the \fBn_addrtype\fR member and the network number \fInet\fR matches the \fBn_net\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary. The \fInet\fR argument is the network number in host byte order.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetnetbyname()\fR function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the network name specified by \fIname\fR matches the \fBn_name\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetnetent()\fR function opens and rewinds the database.  If the \fIstayopen\fR argument is non-zero, the connection to the net database will not be closed after each call to \fBgetnetent()\fR (either directly, or indirectly through one of the other \fBgetnet*(\|)\fR functions).
.sp
.LP
The \fBendnetent()\fR function closes the database.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetnetbyaddr()\fR, \fBgetnetbyname()\fR and \fBgetnetent()\fR, functions may return pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
.sp
.LP
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, \fBgetnetbyaddr()\fR, \fBgetnetbyname()\fR and \fBgetnetent()\fR, return a pointer to a \fBnetent\fR structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.  Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
