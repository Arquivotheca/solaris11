.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetprotobyname()\fR, \fBgetprotobynumber()\fR and \fBgetprotoent()\fR, functions each return a pointer to a \fBprotoent\fR structure, the members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network protocol database.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetprotoent()\fR function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetprotobyname()\fR function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the protocol name specified by \fIname\fR matches the \fBp_name\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetprotobynumber()\fR function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the protocol number specified by \fInumber\fR matches the \fBp_proto\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetprotoent()\fR function opens a connection to the database, and sets the next entry to the first entry.  If the \fIstayopen\fR argument is non-zero, the connection to the network protocol database will not be closed after each call to \fBgetprotoent()\fR (either directly, or indirectly through one of the other \fBgetproto*(\|)\fR functions).
.sp
.LP
The \fBendprotoent()\fR function closes the connection to the database.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetprotobyname()\fR, \fBgetprotobynumber()\fR and \fBgetprotoent()\fR functions may return pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
.sp
.LP
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, \fBgetprotobyname()\fR, \fBgetprotobynumber()\fR and \fBgetprotoent()\fR functions return a pointer to a \fBprotoent\fR structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.  Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
.SH ERRORS

.LP
No errors are defined.
