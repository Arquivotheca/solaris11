.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetservbyname()\fR, \fBgetservbyport()\fR and \fBgetservent()\fR functions each return a pointer to a \fBservent\fR structure, the members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network services database.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetservent()\fR function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetservbyname()\fR function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the service name specified by \fIname\fR matches the \fBs_name\fR member and the protocol name specified by \fIproto\fR matches the \fBs_proto\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.  If \fIproto\fR is a null pointer, any value of the \fBs_proto\fR member will be matched.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetservbyport()\fR function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the port specified by \fIport\fR matches the \fBs_port\fR member and the protocol name specified by \fIproto\fR matches the \fBs_proto\fR member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.  If \fIproto\fR is a null pointer, any value of the \fBs_proto\fR member will be matched.  The \fIport\fR argument must be in network byte order.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetservent()\fR function opens a connection to the database, and sets the next entry to the first entry.  If the \fIstayopen\fR argument is non-zero, the net database will not be closed after each call to the \fBgetservent()\fR function, either directly, or indirectly through one of the other \fBgetserv*()\fR functions.
.sp
.LP
The \fBendservent()\fR function closes the database.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fIport\fR argument of \fBgetservbyport()\fR need not be compatible with the port values of all address families.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetservent()\fR, \fBgetservbyname()\fR and \fBgetservbyport()\fR functions may return pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
.sp
.LP
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, \fBgetservbyname()\fR, \fBgetservbyport()\fR and \fBgetservent()\fR return a pointer to a \fBservent\fR structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.  Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
.SH ERRORS

No errors are defined.
