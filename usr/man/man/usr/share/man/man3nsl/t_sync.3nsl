.SH NAME
t_sync \- synchronize transport library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_sync\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
For the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR, \fBt_sync()\fR synchronizes the data structures managed by the transport library with information from the underlying transport provider. In doing so, it can convert an uninitialized file descriptor (obtained by means of a  \fBopen\fR(2), \fBdup\fR(2) or as a result of a \fBfork\fR(2) and \fBexec\fR(2)) to an initialized transport endpoint, assuming that the file descriptor referenced a transport  endpoint, by updating and allocating the necessary library data structures. This function also allows two cooperating processes to synchronize their interaction with a transport provider.
.sp
.LP
For example, if a process forks a new process and issues an \fBexec\fR(2), the new process must issue a \fBt_sync()\fR to build the private library data structure associated with a transport endpoint and to synchronize the data structure with the relevant provider information.
.sp
.LP
It is important to remember that the transport provider treats all users of a transport endpoint as a single user. If multiple processes are using the same endpoint, they should coordinate their activities so as not to violate the state of the transport endpoint.  The function \fBt_sync()\fR returns the current state of the transport endpoint to the user, thereby enabling the user to verify the state before taking further action. This coordination is only valid among cooperating processes; it is possible that a process or an incoming event could change the endpoint's state \fIafter\fR a \fBt_sync()\fR is issued.
.sp
.LP
If the transport endpoint is undergoing a state transition when \fBt_sync()\fR is called, the function will fail.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, the state of the transport endpoint is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error. The state returned is one of the following:

.SH ERRORS

On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint. This error may be returned when the \fIfd\fR has been previously closed or an erroneous number may have been passed to the call.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fB(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

\fB\fBTSTATECHNG\fR\fR

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h> 
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
