.TH t_rcvrel 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_rcvrel \- acknowledge receipt of an orderly release indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>

\fBint\fR \fBt_rcvrel\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function is used to receive an orderly release indication for the incoming direction of data transfer. The argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists. After receipt of this indication, the user may not attempt to receive more data by means of  \fBt_rcv\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_rcvv()\fR. Such an attempt will fail with  \fIt_error\fR set to \fBTOUTSTATE\fR. However, the user may continue to send data over the connection if \fBt_sndrel\fR(3NSL) has not been called by the user. This function is an optional service of the transport provider, and is only supported if the transport provider returned service type \fBT_COTS_ORD\fR on \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL). Any user data that may be associated with the orderly release indication is discarded when  \fBt_rcvrel()\fR is called.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_DATAXFER\fR, \fBT_OUTREL\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h>
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface are:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTOUTSTATE\fR
.in -2
