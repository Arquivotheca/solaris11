.TH t_sndrel 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_sndrel \- initiate an orderly release
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_sndrel\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
For transport providers of type  \fBT_COTS_ORD,\fR this function is used to initiate an orderly release of the outgoing direction of data transfer and indicates to the transport provider that the transport user has no more data to send. The argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists. After calling \fBt_sndrel()\fR, the user may not send any more data over the connection. However, a user may continue to receive data if an orderly release indication has not been received. For transport providers of types other than  \fBT_COTS_ORD,\fR this function fails with error \fBTNOTSUPPORT\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is \fBreturned\fR and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_DATAXFER\fR, \fBT_INREL\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
\fBO_NONBLOCK\fR was set, but the flow control mechanism prevented the transport provider from accepting the function at this time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTLOOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint and requires immediate attention.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNOTSUPPORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTOUTSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The communications endpoint referenced by  \fIfd\fR is not in one of the states in which a call to this function is valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fB(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
.RE

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h> 
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface are:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTLOOK\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTOUTSTATE\fR
.in -2
.SS "Notes"
.sp
.LP
Whenever this function fails with \fBt_error\fR set to \fBTFLOW,\fR \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR must have been set.
