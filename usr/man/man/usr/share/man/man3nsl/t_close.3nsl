.TH t_close 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_close \- close a transport endpoint
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>




\fBint\fR \fBt_close\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_close()\fR function informs the transport provider that the user is finished with the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR, and frees any local library resources associated with the endpoint. In addition, \fBt_close()\fR closes the file associated with the transport endpoint.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBt_close()\fR should be called from the \fBT_UNBND\fR state. See \fBt_getstate\fR(3NSL). However, this function does not check state information, so it may be called from any state to close a transport endpoint. If this occurs, the local library resources associated with the endpoint will be freed automatically.  In addition, \fBclose\fR(2) will be issued for that file descriptor; if there are no other descriptors in this process or in another process which references the communication endpoint, any connection that may be associated with that endpoint is broken. The connection may be terminated in an orderly or abortive manner.
.sp
.LP
A \fBt_close()\fR issued on a connection endpoint may cause data previously sent, or data not yet received, to be lost. It is the responsibility of the transport user to ensure that data is received by the remote peer.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR \fBis\fR returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 \fBis\fR \fBreturned\fR \fBand\fR \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES

.SH ERRORS

On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.LP
\fB#include\fR \fB<tiuser.h>\fR 
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
