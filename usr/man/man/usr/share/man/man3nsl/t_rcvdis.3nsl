.TH t_rcvdis 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_rcvdis \- retrieve information from disconnection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_rcvdis\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_discon *\fR\fIdiscon\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function is used to identify the cause of a disconnection and to retrieve any user data sent with the disconnection. The argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection existed, and \fIdiscon\fR points to a \fBt_discon\fR structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf udata;
int reason;
int sequence;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The field \fIreason\fR specifies the reason for the disconnection through a protocol-dependent reason code, \fIudata\fR identifies any user data that was sent with the disconnection, and \fIsequence\fR may identify an outstanding connection indication with which the disconnection is associated.  The field \fIsequence\fR is only meaningful when \fBt_rcvdis()\fR is issued by a passive transport user who has executed one or more \fBt_listen\fR(3NSL) functions and is processing the resulting connection indications. If a disconnection indication occurs, \fIsequence\fR can be used to identify which of the outstanding connection indications is associated with the disconnection.
.sp
.LP
The  \fImaxlen\fR field of  \fIudata\fR may be set to zero, if the user does not care about incoming data. If, in addition, the user does not need to know the value of  \fIreason\fR or  \fIsequence\fR, \fIdiscon\fR may be set to  \fINULL\fR and any user data associated with the disconnection indication shall be discarded. However, if a user has retrieved more than one outstanding connection indication by means of \fBt_listen\fR(3NSL), and \fIdiscon\fR is a null pointer, the user will be unable to identify with which connection indication the disconnection is associated.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_DATAXFER\fR, \fBT_OUTCON\fR, \fBT_OUTREL\fR, \fBT_INREL\fR, \fBT_INCON(ocnt > 0)\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The number of bytes allocated for incoming data \fI(maxlen)\fR is greater than  \fB0\fR but not sufficient to store the data.  If \fIfd\fR is a passive endpoint with \fIocnt\fR > 1, it remains in state  \fBT_INCON;\fR otherwise, the endpoint state is set to  \fBT_IDLE.\fR 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNODIS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
No disconnection indication currently exists on the specified transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNOTSUPPORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTOUTSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The communications endpoint referenced by  \fIfd\fR is not in one of the states in which a call to this function is valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fB(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header: 
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h>
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values \fBTPROTO\fR and \fBTOUTSTATE\fR can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface but not by the \fBTLI\fR interface.
.sp
.LP
A failure return, and a \fBt_errno\fR value that this routine can set under different circumstances than its \fBXTI\fR counterpart is \fBTBUFOVFLW.\fR It can be returned even when the \fBmaxlen\fR field of the corresponding buffer has been set to zero.
