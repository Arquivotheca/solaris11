.TH t_look 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_look \- look at the current event on a transport endpoint
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_look\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function returns the current event on the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR. This function enables a transport provider to notify a transport user of an asynchronous event when the user is calling functions in synchronous mode. Certain events require immediate notification of the user and are indicated by a specific error, \fBTLOOK\fR, on the current or next function to be executed. 
.sp
.LP
This function also enables a transport user to poll a transport endpoint periodically for asynchronous events.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon success, \fBt_look()\fR returns a value that indicates which of the allowable events has occurred, or returns zero if no event exists. One of the following events is returned:

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <tiuser.h> 
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Return Values"
.sp
.LP
The return values that are defined by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be returned by the \fBTLI\fR interface are:
.br
.in +2
\fBT_GODATA\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBT_GOEXDATA\fR
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
