.TH t_sndudata 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_sndudata \- send a data unit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h> 




\fBint\fR \fBt_sndudata\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBconst struct t_unitdata *\fR\fIunitdata\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function is used in connectionless-mode to send a data unit to another transport user. The argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint through which data will be sent, and \fIunitdata\fR points to a \fBt_unitdata\fR structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf addr;
struct netbuf opt;
struct netbuf udata;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
In \fIunitdata\fR, \fIaddr\fR specifies the protocol address of the destination user, \fIopt\fR identifies options that the user wants associated with this request, and \fIudata\fR specifies the user data to be sent. The user may choose not to specify what protocol options are associated with the transfer by setting the \fIlen\fR field of \fIopt\fR to zero. In this case, the provider uses the option values currently set for the communications endpoint.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIlen\fR field of \fIudata\fR is zero, and sending of zero octets is not supported by the underlying transport service, the \fBt_sndudata()\fR will return  -1 with \fBt_errno\fR set to \fBTBADDATA\fR.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBt_sndudata()\fR operates in synchronous mode and may wait if flow control restrictions prevent the data from being accepted by the local transport provider at the time the call is made.  However, if  \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR \fBis\fR \fBset\fR \fBby\fR \fBmeans\fR \fBof\fR \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or \fBfcntl\fR(2), \fBt_sndudata()\fR will execute in asynchronous mode and will fail under such conditions. The process can arrange to be notified of the clearance of a flow control restriction by means of either \fBt_look\fR(3NSL) or the EM interface.
.sp
.LP
If the amount of data specified in \fIudata\fR exceeds the TSDU size as returned in the \fItsdu\fR field of the \fIinfo\fR argument of \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL), a \fBTBADDATA\fR error will be generated. If \fBt_sndudata()\fR is called before the destination user has activated its transport endpoint (see \fBt_bind\fR(3NSL)), the data unit may be discarded.
.sp
.LP
If it is not possible for the transport provider to immediately detect the conditions that cause the errors \fBTBADDADDR\fR and \fBTBADOPT\fR, these errors will alternatively be returned by \fIt_rcvuderr.\fR Therefore, an application must be prepared to receive these errors in both of these ways.
.sp
.LP
If the call is interrupted, \fBt_sndudata()\fR will return \fBEINTR\fR and the datagram will not be sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h.\fR \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h> 
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface are:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTBADADDR\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTBADOPT\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTLOOK\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBTOUTSTATE\fR
.in -2
.SS "Notes"
.sp
.LP
Whenever this function fails with \fBt_error\fR set to \fBTFLOW,\fR \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR must have been set.
.SS "Option Buffers"
.sp
.LP
The format of the options in an \fBopt\fR buffer is dictated by the transport provider. Unlike the \fBXTI\fR interface, the \fBTLI\fR interface does not fix the buffer format.
