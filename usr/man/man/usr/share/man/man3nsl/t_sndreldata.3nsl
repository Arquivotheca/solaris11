.TH t_sndreldata 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_sndreldata \- initiate or respond to an orderly release with user data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h> 




\fBint\fR \fBt_sndreldata\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_discon *\fR\fIdiscon\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is used to initiate an orderly release of the outgoing direction of data transfer and to send user data with the release.  The argument  \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists, and  \fIdiscon\fR points to a  \fB t_discon\fR structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf udata;
int reason;
int sequence;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
After calling  \fBt_sndreldata()\fR, the user may not send any more data over the connection.  However, a user may continue to receive data if an orderly release indication has not been received.
.sp
.LP
The field  \fIreason\fR specifies the reason for the disconnection through a protocol-dependent  \fIreason code\fR, and  \fIudata\fR identifies any user data that is sent with the disconnection; the field  \fIsequence\fR is not used.
.sp
.LP
The  \fIudata\fR structure specifies the user data to be sent to the remote user.  The amount of user data must not exceed the limits supported by the transport provider, as returned in the  \fIdiscon\fR field of the  \fIinfo\fR argument of \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL). If the  \fIlen\fR field of  \fIudata\fR is zero or if the provider did not return  \fBT_ORDRELDATA\fR in the  \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) flags, no data will be sent to the remote user.
.sp
.LP
If a user does not wish to send data and reason code to the remote user, the value of  \fIdiscon\fR may be a null pointer.
.sp
.LP
This function is an optional service of the transport provider, only supported by providers of service type \fBT_COTS_ORD.\fR The flag  \fBT_ORDRELDATA\fR in the  \fIinfo\(->flag\fR field returned by  \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL) indicates that the provider supports orderly release user data. 
.sp
.LP
This function may not be available on all systems.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and  \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_DATAXFER\fR, \fBT_INREL\fR.
.SH ERRORS

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces \fBt_sndreldata()\fR and \fBt_rcvreldata\fR(3NSL) are only for use with a specific transport called "minimal OSI," which is not available on the Solaris platform. These interfaces are not available for use in conjunction with Internet Transports (\fBTCP\fR or \fBUDP\fR).
