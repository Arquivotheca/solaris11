.TH t_strerror 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_strerror \- produce an error message string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h> 




\fBconst char *\fR\fBt_strerror\fR(\fBint\fR \fIerrnum\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_strerror()\fR function maps the error number in \fIerrnum\fR that corresponds to an XTI error to a language-dependent error message string and returns a pointer to the string. The string pointed to will not be modified by the program, but may be overwritten by a subsequent call to the \fIt_strerror\fR function. The string is not terminated by a newline character. The language for error message strings written by \fBt_strerror()\fR is that of the current locale. If it is English, the error message string describing the value in \fBt_errno\fR may be derived from the comments following the \fBt_errno\fR codes defined in \fB<xti.h>\fR\&. If an error code is unknown, and the language is English, \fBt_strerror()\fR returns the string:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"<error>: error unknown"
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where <error> is the error number supplied as input.  In other languages, an equivalent text is provided.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
ALL - apart from \fBT_UNINIT\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The function \fBt_strerror()\fR returns a pointer to the generated message string.
.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h>
.in -2
