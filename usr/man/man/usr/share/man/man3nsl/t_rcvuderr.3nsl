.TH t_rcvuderr 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_rcvuderr \- receive a unit data error indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_rcvuderr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_uderr *\fR\fIuderr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function is used in connectionless-mode to receive information concerning an error on a previously sent data unit, and should only be issued following a unit data error indication. It informs the transport user that a data unit with a specific destination address and protocol options produced an error. The argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint through which the error report will be received, and \fIuderr\fR points to a \fBt_uderr\fR structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf addr;
struct netbuf opt;
t_scalar_t error;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fImaxlen\fR field of \fIaddr\fR and \fIopt\fR must be set before calling this function to indicate the maximum size of the buffer for each. If this field is set to zero for  \fIaddr\fR or  \fIopt\fR, no information is returned in the  \fIbuf\fR field of this parameter.
.sp
.LP
On return from this call, the \fIaddr\fR structure specifies the destination protocol address of the erroneous data unit, the \fIopt\fR structure identifies options that were associated with the data unit, and \fBerror\fR specifies a protocol-dependent error code.
.sp
.LP
If the user does not care to identify the data unit that produced an error, \fIuderr\fR may be set to a null pointer, and \fBt_rcvuderr()\fR will simply clear the error indication without reporting any information to the user.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_IDLE\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The number of bytes allocated for the incoming protocol address or options \fI(maxlen)\fR is greater than 0 but not sufficient to store the information. The unit data error information to be returned in \fIuderr\fR will be discarded.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNOTSUPPORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNOUDERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
No unit data error indication currently exists on the specified transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTOUTSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The communications endpoint referenced by \fIfd\fR is not in one of the states in which a call to this function is valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fB(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
\fB#include <tiuser.h>\fR
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values \fBTPROTO\fR and \fBTOUTSTATE\fR can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface but not by the \fBTLI\fR interface.
.sp
.LP
A \fBt_errno\fR value that this routine can return under different circumstances than its \fBXTI\fR counterpart is \fBTBUFOVFLW.\fR It can be returned even when the \fBmaxlen\fR field of the corresponding buffer has been set to zero.
.SS "Option Buffers"
.sp
.LP
The format of the options in an \fBopt\fR buffer is dictated by the transport provider. Unlike the \fBXTI\fR interface, the \fBTLI\fR interface does not fix the buffer format.
