.TH t_rcvreldata 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_rcvreldata \- receive an orderly release indication or confirmation containing user data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_rcvreldata\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_discon *\fR\fIdiscon\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This function is used to receive an orderly release indication for the incoming direction of data transfer and to retrieve any user data sent with the release. The argument  \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists, and  \fIdiscon\fR points to a \fBt_discon\fR structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf udata;
int reason;
int sequence;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
After receipt of this indication, the user may not attempt to receive  more data by means of  \fBt_rcv\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_rcvv\fR(3NSL) Such an attempt will fail with  \fIt_error\fR set to \fBTOUTSTATE\fR. However, the user may continue to send data over the connection if  \fBt_sndrel\fR(3NSL) or \fBt_sndreldata\fR \fB(3N)\fR has not been called by the user.
.sp
.LP
The field  \fIreason\fR specifies the reason for the disconnection through a protocol-dependent  \fIreason code\fR, and  \fIudata\fR identifies any user data that was sent with the disconnection; the field  \fIsequence\fR is not used.
.sp
.LP
If a user does not care if there is incoming data and does not need to know the value of  \fIreason\fR, \fIdiscon\fR may be a null pointer, and any user data associated with the disconnection will be discarded.
.sp
.LP
If  \fIdiscon\(->udata.maxlen\fR is greater than zero and less than the length of the value,  \fBt_rcvreldata()\fR fails with  \fBt_errno\fR set to \fBTBUFOVFLW\fR.
.sp
.LP
This function is an optional service of the transport provider, only supported by providers of service type \fBT_COTS_ORD.\fR The flag  \fBT_ORDRELDATA\fR in the  \fIinfo\(->flag\fR field returned by  \fBt_open\fR(3NSL) or  \fBt_getinfo\fR(3NSL) indicates that the provider supports orderly release user data; when the flag is not set, this function behaves like \fBt_rcvrel\fR(3NSL) and no user data is returned.
.sp
.LP
This function may not be available on all systems.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and  \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_DATAXFER\fR, \fBT_OUTREL\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure,  \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The number of bytes allocated for incoming data (maxlen) is greater than \fB0\fR but not sufficient to store the data, and the disconnection information to be returned in  \fIdiscon\fR will be discarded. The provider state, as seen by the user, will be changed as if the data was successfully retrieved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTLOOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBTOUTSTATE\fR\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces \fBt_sndreldata\fR(3NSL) and \fBt_rcvreldata()\fR are only for use with a specific transport called "minimal OSI," which is not available on the Solaris platform. These interfaces are not available for use in conjunction with Internet Transports (\fBTCP\fR or \fBUDP\fR).
