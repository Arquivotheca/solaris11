.TH t_errno 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_errno \- XTI error return value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This error return value is part of the XTI interfaces that evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI interface that has the same name as an XTI interfaces, a different headerfile, <\fBtiuser.h\fR>, must be used. Refer the the TLI COMPATIBILITY section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
\fBt_errno\fR is used by XTI functions to return error values.
.sp
.LP
XTI functions provide an error number in  \fBt_errno\fR which has type  \fIint\fR and is defined in  \fB<xti.h>\fR\&. The value of  \fBt_errno\fR will be defined only after a call to a XTI function for which it is explicitly stated to be set and until it is changed by the next XTI function call. The value of  \fBt_errno\fR should only be examined when it is indicated to be valid by a function's return value. Programs should obtain the definition of  \fBt_errno\fR by the inclusion of  \fB<xti.h>\fR\&. The practice of defining  \fBt_errno\fR in program as  \fBextern\fR \fBint\fR \fBt_errno\fR is obsolescent. No XTI function sets  \fBt_errno\fR to 0 to indicate an error.
.sp
.LP
It is unspecified whether \fBt_errno\fR is a macro or an identifier with external linkage.  It represents a modifiable  \fBlvalue\fR of type \fIint\fR. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual object or a program defines an identifier with name  \fIt_errno\fR, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The symbolic values stored in  \fBt_errno\fR by an XTI function are defined in the \fBERRORS\fR sections in all relevant XTI function definition pages.
.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
\fBt_errno\fR is also used by TLI functions to return error values.
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, <\fBxti.h\fR>. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br

\fB#include <tiuser.h>\fR

.SS "Error Description Values"

The \fBt_errno\fR values that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface but cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface are:
