.SH NAME
t_getprotaddr \- get the protocol addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBt_getprotaddr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_bind *\fR\fIboundaddr\fR,
     \fBstruct t_bind *\fR\fIpeeraddr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_getprotaddr()\fR function returns local and remote protocol addresses currently associated with the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR. In \fIboundaddr\fR and \fIpeeraddr\fR the user specifies \fImaxlen\fR, which is the maximum size (in bytes) of the address buffer, and \fIbuf\fR which points to the buffer where the address is to be placed. On return, the \fIbuf\fR field of \fIboundaddr\fR points to the address, if any, currently bound to \fIfd\fR, and the \fIlen\fR field specifies the length of the address. If the transport endpoint is in the \fBT_UNBND\fR state, zero is returned in the \fIlen\fR field of \fIboundaddr\fR. The \fIbuf\fR field of \fIpeeraddr\fR points to the address, if any, currently connected to \fIfd\fR, and the \fIlen\fR field specifies the length of the address. If the transport endpoint is not in the  \fBT_DATAXFER,\fR \fBT_INREL,\fR \fBT_OUTCON\fR or  \fBT_OUTREL\fR states, zero is returned in the \fIlen\fR field of \fIpeeraddr\fR. If the  \fImaxlen\fR field of  \fIboundaddr\fR or \fIpeeraddr\fR is set to zero, no address is returned.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
ALL - apart from \fBT_UNINIT\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The number of bytes allocated for an incoming argument (\fImaxlen)\fR is greater than  \fB0\fR but not sufficient to store the value of that argument.
