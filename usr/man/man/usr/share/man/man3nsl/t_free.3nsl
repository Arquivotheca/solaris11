.TH t_free 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_free \- free a library structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>




\fBint\fR \fBt_free\fR(\fBvoid *\fR\fIptr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIstruct_type\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_free()\fR function frees memory previously allocated by \fBt_alloc\fR(3NSL). This function will free memory for the specified structure, and will also free memory for buffers referenced by the structure.
.sp
.LP
The argument \fIptr\fR points to one of the seven structure types described for \fBt_alloc\fR(3NSL), and \fIstruct_type\fR identifies the type of that structure which must be one of the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
T_BIND      struct	t_bind
T_CALL      struct	t_call
T_OPTMGMT   struct	t_optmgmt
T_DIS       struct	t_discon
T_UNITDATA  struct	t_unitdata
T_UDERROR   struct	t_uderr
T_INFO      struct	t_info
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where each of these structures is used as an argument to one or more transport functions.
.sp
.LP
The function \fBt_free()\fR will check the \fIaddr\fR, \fIopt\fR and \fIudata\fR fields of the given structure, as appropriate, and free the buffers pointed to by the \fIbuf\fR field of the \fBnetbuf\fR structure. If \fIbuf\fR is a null pointer, \fBt_free()\fR will not attempt to free memory.  After all buffers are freed, \fBt_free()\fR will free the memory associated with the structure pointed to by \fIptr\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Undefined results will occur if \fIptr\fR or any of the \fIbuf\fR pointers points to a block of memory that was not previously allocated by \fBt_alloc\fR(3NSL). 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
ALL - apart from \fBT_UNINIT\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTNOSTRUCTYPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Unsupported \fIstruct_type\fR requested.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fI(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <tiuser.h> 
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
