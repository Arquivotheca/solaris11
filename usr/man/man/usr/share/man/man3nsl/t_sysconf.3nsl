.SH NAME
t_sysconf \- get configurable XTI variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h> 



\fBint\fR \fBt_sysconf\fR(\fBint\fR\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBt_sysconf()\fR function provides a method for the application to determine the current value of configurable and  implementation-dependent XTI limits or options.
.sp
.LP
The  \fIname\fR argument represents the XTI system variable to be queried.  The following table lists the minimal set of XTI system variables from  \fB<xti.h>\fR that can be returned by  \fBt_sysconf()\fR, and the symbolic constants, defined in  \fB<xti.h>\fR that are the corresponding values used for  \fIname\fR.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If  \fIname\fR is valid,  \fBt_sysconf()\fR returns the value of the requested limit/option, which might be  -1, and leaves  \fBt_errno\fR unchanged. Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and  \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
All.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure,  \fBt_errno\fR is set to the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADFLAG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
\fIname\fR has an invalid value.
