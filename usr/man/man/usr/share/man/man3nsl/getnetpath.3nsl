.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The routines described on this page are part of the Network Selection component. They provide the application access to the system network configuration database, \fB/etc/netconfig\fR, as it is "filtered" by the \fBNETPATH\fR environment variable. See \fBenviron\fR(5). See \fBgetnetconfig\fR(3NSL) for other routines that also access the network configuration database directly. The \fBNETPATH\fR variable is a list of colon-separated network identifiers.
.sp
.LP
\fBgetnetpath()\fR returns a pointer to the  \fBnetconfig\fR database entry corresponding to the first  valid \fBNETPATH\fR component. The \fBnetconfig\fR entry is formatted as a \fBstruct netconfig\fR. On each subsequent call, \fBgetnetpath()\fR returns a pointer to the  \fBnetconfig\fR entry that corresponds to the next valid \fBNETPATH\fR component. \fBgetnetpath()\fR can thus be used to search the \fBnetconfig\fR database for all networks included in the \fBNETPATH\fR variable. When \fBNETPATH\fR has been exhausted, \fBgetnetpath()\fR returns NULL.
.sp
.LP
A call to \fBsetnetpath()\fR "binds" to or "rewinds" \fBNETPATH\fR. \fBsetnetpath()\fR must be called before the first call to \fBgetnetpath()\fR and may be called at any other time. It returns a handle that is used by \fBgetnetpath()\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBgetnetpath()\fR silently ignores invalid  \fBNETPATH\fR components. A \fBNETPATH\fR component is invalid if there is no corresponding entry in the \fBnetconfig\fR database.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBNETPATH\fR variable is \fBunset\fR, \fBgetnetpath()\fR behaves as if \fBNETPATH\fR were set to the sequence of "default" or "visible" networks in the \fBnetconfig\fR database, in the order in which they are listed.
.sp
.LP
\fBendnetpath()\fR may be called to "unbind" from \fBNETPATH\fR when processing is complete, releasing resources for reuse. Programmers should be aware, however, that \fBendnetpath()\fR frees all memory allocated by \fBgetnetpath()\fR for the \fBstruct netconfig\fR data structure. \fBendnetpath()\fR returns \fB0\fR on success and \fB-1\fR on failure (for example, if \fBsetnetpath()\fR was not called previously).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBsetnetpath()\fR returns a handle that is used by \fBgetnetpath()\fR. In case of an error, \fBsetnetpath()\fR returns \fBNULL.\fR \fBnc_perror()\fR or \fBnc_sperror()\fR can be used to print out the reason for failure. See \fBgetnetconfig\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
When first called, \fBgetnetpath()\fR returns a pointer to the \fBnetconfig\fR database entry corresponding to the first valid \fBNETPATH\fR component. When \fBNETPATH\fR has been exhausted, \fBgetnetpath()\fR returns NULL.
.sp
.LP
\fBendnetpath()\fR returns \fB0\fR on success and\fB -1 \fRon failure (for example, if \fBsetnetpath()\fR was not called previously).
