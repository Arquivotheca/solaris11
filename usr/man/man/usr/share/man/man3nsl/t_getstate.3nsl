.TH t_getstate 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_getstate \- get the current state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_getstate\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_getstate()\fR function returns the current state of the provider associated with the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
State is returned upon successful completion.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.  The current state is one of the following:
.sp

If the provider is undergoing a state transition when \fBt_getstate()\fR is called, the function will fail.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error \fB(t_errno)\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTSTATECHNG\fR\fR

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <tiuser.h> 
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.sp
.LP
\fBTPROTO\fR
