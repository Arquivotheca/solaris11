.TH t_error 3NSL "7 May 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "Networking Services Library Functions"
.SH NAME
t_error \- produce error message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>




\fBint\fR \fBt_error\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIerrmsg\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the \fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the  \fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_error()\fR function produces a message on the standard error output which describes the last error encountered during a call to a transport function. The argument string \fIerrmsg\fR is a user-supplied error message that gives context to the error.
.sp
.LP
The error message is written as follows: first (if \fIerrmsg\fR is not a null pointer and the character pointed to be \fIerrmsg\fR is not the null character) the string pointed to by \fIerrmsg\fR followed by a colon and a space; then a standard error message string for the current error defined in \fBt_errno\fR.  If \fBt_errno\fR has a value different from \fBTSYSERR\fR, the standard error message string is followed by a newline character.  If, however, \fBt_errno\fR is equal to \fBTSYSERR\fR, the \fBt_errno\fR string is followed by the standard error message string for the current error defined in \fBerrno\fR followed by a newline.
.sp
.LP
The language for error message strings written by \fBt_error()\fR is that of the current locale.  If it is English, the error message string describing the value in \fBt_errno\fR may be derived from the comments following the \fBt_errno\fR codes defined in \fBxti.h\fR.  The contents of the error message strings describing the value in \fBerrno\fR are the same as those returned by the  \fBstrerror\fR(3C) function with an argument of \fBerrno\fR.
.sp
.LP
The error number, \fBt_errno\fR, is only set when an error occurs and it is not cleared on successful calls.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
If a \fBt_connect\fR(3NSL) function fails on transport endpoint \fIfd2\fR because a bad address was given, the following call might follow the failure:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
t_error("t_connect failed on fd2");
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The diagnostic message to be printed would look like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
t_connect failed on fd2: incorrect addr format
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where \fIincorrect addr format\fR identifies the specific error that occurred, and \fIt_connect failed on fd2\fR tells the user which function failed on which transport endpoint.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
All - apart from \fBT_UNINIT\fR
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined for the \fBt_error()\fR function.
.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <tiuser.h> 
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.sp
.LP
\fBTPROTO\fR
