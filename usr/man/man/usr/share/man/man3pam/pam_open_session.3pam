.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_open_session()\fR function is called after a user has been successfully authenticated. See  \fBpam_authenticate\fR(3PAM) and \fBpam_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM). It is used to notify the session modules that a new session  has been initiated.  All programs that use the  \fBpam\fR(3PAM) library should invoke \fBpam_open_session()\fR when beginning a new session. Upon termination of this activity, \fBpam_close_session()\fR should be invoked to inform \fBpam\fR(3PAM) that the session has terminated.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpamh\fR argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to \fBpam_start()\fR. The following flag may be set in the \fIflags\fR field for \fBpam_open_session()\fR and \fBpam_close_session()\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The session service should not generate any messages.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,  \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR is returned.  In addition to the return values defined in \fBpam\fR(3PAM), the following value may be returned on error:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SESSION_ERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Cannot make or remove an entry for the specified session.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In many instances, the \fBpam_open_session()\fR and \fBpam_close_session()\fR calls may be made by different processes. For example, in UNIX the \fBlogin\fR process opens a session, while the \fBinit\fR process closes the session.  In this case, \fBUTMP/WTMP\fR entries may be used to link the call to \fBpam_close_session()\fR with an earlier call to \fBpam_open_session()\fR. This is possible because \fBUTMP/WTMP\fR entries are uniquely identified by a combination of attributes, including the user login name and device name, which are accessible through the  \fBPAM\fR handle, \fIpamh\fR. The call to \fBpam_open_session()\fR should precede  \fBUTMP/WTMP\fR entry management, and the call to \fBpam_close_session()\fR should follow  \fBUTMP/WTMP\fR exit management.
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in  \fBlibpam\fR are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own  \fBPAM\fR handle.
