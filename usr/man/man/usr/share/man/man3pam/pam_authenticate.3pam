.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_authenticate()\fR function is called to authenticate the current user. The user is usually required to enter a password or similar authentication token depending upon the authentication service configured within the system. The user in question should have been specified by a prior call to \fBpam_start()\fR or \fBpam_set_item()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following flags may be set in the \fIflags\fR field:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Authentication service should not generate any messages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
The authentication service should return  \fBPAM_AUTH_ERR\fR if the user has a null authentication token.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,  \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR is returned.  In addition to the error return values described in \fBpam\fR(3PAM), the following values may be returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_AUTH_ERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Authentication failure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBPAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL\fR\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In the case of authentication failures due to an incorrect username or password, it is the responsibility of the application to retry \fBpam_authenticate()\fR and to maintain the retry count. An authentication service module may implement an internal retry count and return an error \fBPAM_MAXTRIES\fR if the module does not want the application to retry.
.sp
.LP
If the  \fBPAM\fR framework cannot load the authentication module, then it will return  \fBPAM_ABORT\fR. This indicates a serious failure, and  the application should not attempt to retry the authentication.
.sp
.LP
For security reasons, the location of authentication failures is hidden from the user.   Thus, if several authentication services are stacked and a single service fails, \fBpam_authenticate()\fR requires that the user re-authenticate each of the services.
.sp
.LP
A null authentication token in the authentication database will result in successful authentication unless \fBPAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK\fR was specified. In such cases, there will be no prompt to the user to enter an authentication token.
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in  \fBlibpam\fR are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own  \fBPAM\fR handle.
