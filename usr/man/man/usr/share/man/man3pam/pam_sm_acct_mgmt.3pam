\fBint\fR \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt\fR(\fBpam_handle_t *\fR\fIpamh\fR, \fBint\fR \fIflags\fR, \fBint\fR \fIargc\fR,
     \fBconst char **\fR\fIargv\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In response to a call to \fBpam_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM), the  \fBPAM\fR framework calls \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt()\fR from the modules listed in the \fBpam.conf\fR(4) file. The account management provider supplies the back-end functionality for this interface function. Applications should not call this  \fBAPI\fR directly.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt()\fR function determines whether or not the current user's account and password are valid.   This includes checking for password and account expiration, and valid login times. The user in question is specified by a prior call to \fBpam_start()\fR, and is referenced by the authentication handle, \fIpamh\fR, which is passed as the first argument to \fBpam_sm_acct_mgmt()\fR. The following flags may be set in the \fIflags\fR field:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
The account management service should not generate any messages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
The account management service should return  \fBPAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD\fR if the user has a null authentication token.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fIargc\fR argument represents the number of module options passed in from the configuration file \fBpam.conf\fR(4). \fIargv\fR specifies the module options, which are interpreted and processed by the account management service.  Please refer to the specific module man pages for the various available \fIoptions\fR. If an unknown option is passed to the module, an error should be logged through \fBsyslog\fR(3C) and the option ignored.
.sp
.LP
If an account management module determines that the user password has aged or expired, it should save this information as state in the authentication handle, \fIpamh\fR, using  \fBpam_set_data()\fR. \fBpam_chauthok()\fR uses this information to determine which passwords have expired.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If there are no restrictions to logging in,  \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR is returned.  The following error values may also be returned upon error:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in  \fBlibpam\fR are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own  \fBPAM\fR handle.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBPAM_REPOSITORY\fR \fIitem_type\fR is set and a service module does not recognize the type, the service module does not process any information, and returns \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR. If the \fBPAM_REPOSITORY\fR \fIitem_type\fR is not set, a service module performs its default action.
