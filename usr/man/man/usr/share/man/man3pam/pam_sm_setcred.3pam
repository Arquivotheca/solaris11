\fBint\fR \fBpam_sm_setcred\fR(\fBpam_handle_t *\fR\fIpamh\fR, \fBint\fR \fIflags\fR, \fBint\fR \fIargc\fR,
     \fBconst char **\fR\fIargv\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In response to a call to \fBpam_setcred\fR(3PAM), the  \fBPAM\fR framework calls \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR from the modules listed in the \fBpam.conf\fR(4) file.  The authentication provider supplies the back-end functionality for this interface function.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR function is called to set the credentials of the current user associated with the authentication handle, \fIpamh\fR. The following flags may be set in the \fIflags\fR field.  Note that the first four flags are mutually exclusive:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_ESTABLISH_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Set user credentials for the authentication service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DELETE_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Delete user credentials associated with the authentication service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Reinitialize user credentials.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_REFRESH_CRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Extend lifetime of user credentials.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Authentication service should not generate messages
.RE

.sp
.LP
If no flag is set,  \fBPAM_ESTABLISH\fR \fB_CRED\fR is used as the default.
.sp
.LP
The \fIargc\fR argument represents the number of module options passed in from the configuration file \fBpam.conf\fR(4). \fIargv\fR specifies the module options, which are interpreted and processed by the authentication service.  If an unknown option is passed to the  module, an error should be logged and the option ignored.
.sp
.LP
If the  \fBPAM_SILENT\fR flag is not set, then \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR should print any failure status from the corresponding  \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR function using the conversation function.
.sp
.LP
The authentication status (success or reason for failure) is saved as module-specific state in the authentication handle by the authentication module. The status should be retrieved using \fBpam_get_data()\fR, and used to determine if user credentials should be set.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,  \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR should be returned. The following values may also be returned upon error:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_CRED_UNAVAIL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Underlying authentication service can not retrieve user credentials.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_CRED_EXPIRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
User credentials have expired.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_USER_UNKNOWN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
User unknown to the authentication service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_CRED_ERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Failure in setting user credentials.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_IGNORE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR function is passed the same module options that are used by \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in  \fBlibpam\fR are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own  \fBPAM\fR handle.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBPAM_REPOSITORY\fR \fIitem_type\fR is set and a service module does not recognize the type, the service module does not process any information, and returns \fBPAM_IGNORE\fR. If the \fBPAM_REPOSITORY\fR \fIitem_type\fR is not set, a service module performs its default action.
