.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_acct_mgmt()\fR function is called to determine if the current user's account is valid.  It checks for password and account expiration, and verifies access hour restrictions. This function is typically called after the user has been authenticated with \fBpam_authenticate\fR(3PAM).
.sp
.LP
The \fIpamh\fR argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to \fBpam_start()\fR. The following flags may be set in the \fIflags\fR field:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
The account management service should not generate any messages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
The account management service should return \fBPAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD\fR if the user has a null authentication token.
