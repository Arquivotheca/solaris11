.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_chauthtok()\fR function is called to change the authentication token associated with a particular user referenced by the authentication handle \fIpamh\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following flag may be passed in to \fBpam_chauthtok()\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_SILENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt  
The password service should not generate any messages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt  
The password service should only update those passwords that have aged. If this flag is not passed, all password services should update their passwords.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPAM_NO_AUTHTOK_CHECK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt  
The password service should not perform conformance checks on the password entered.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion of the call, the authentication token of the user will be changed in accordance with the password service configured in the system through \fBpam.conf\fR(4).
.SH RETURN VALUES

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The flag \fBPAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK\fR is typically used by a \fBlogin\fR application which has determined that the user's password has aged or expired. Before allowing the user to login, the \fBlogin\fR application may invoke \fBpam_chauthtok()\fR with this flag to allow the user to update the password. Typically, applications such as \fBpasswd\fR(1) should not use this flag.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_chauthtok()\fR functions performs a preliminary check before attempting to update passwords. This check is performed for each password module in the stack as listed in \fBpam.conf\fR(4). The check may include pinging remote name services to determine if they are available. If \fBpam_chauthtok()\fR returns \fBPAM_TRY_AGAIN\fR, then the check has failed, and passwords are not updated.
.sp
.LP
The flag \fBPAM_NO_AUTHTOK_CHECK\fR is typically used by programs that allow an administrator to bypass various password conformance checks when setting a password for a user.
.sp
.LP
The interfaces in \fBlibpam\fR are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own \fBPAM\fR handle.
