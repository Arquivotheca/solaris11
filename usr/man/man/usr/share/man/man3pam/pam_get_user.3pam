pam_get_user \- PAM routine to retrieve user name

#include <security/pam_appl.h>



\fBint\fR \fBpam_get_user\fR(\fBpam_handle_t *\fR\fIpamh\fR, \fBchar **\fR\fIuser\fR,
     \fBconst char *\fR\fIprompt\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_get_user()\fR function is used by  \fBPAM\fR service modules to retrieve the current user name from the  \fBPAM\fR handle. If the user name has not been set with \fBpam_start()\fR or  \fBpam_set_item()\fR, the \fBPAM\fR conversation function will be used to prompt the user for the user name with the string "prompt". If \fIprompt\fR is  \fINULL\fR, then \fBpam_get_item()\fR is called and the value of \fBPAM_USER_PROMPT\fR is used for prompting. If the value of  \fBPAM_USER_PROMPT\fR is  \fINULL\fR, the following default prompt is used:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Please enter user name:
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
After the user name is gathered by the conversation function, \fBpam_set_item()\fR is called to set the value of  \fBPAM_USER\fR. By convention, applications that need to prompt for a user name should  call \fBpam_set_item()\fR and set the value of \fBPAM_USER_PROMPT\fR before calling \fBpam_authenticate()\fR. The service module's \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR function will then call \fBpam_get_user()\fR to prompt for the user name. 
.sp
.LP
Note that certain  \fBPAM\fR service modules, such as a smart card module, may override the value of  \fBPAM_USER_PROMPT\fR and pass in their own prompt. Applications that call \fBpam_authenticate()\fR multiple times should set the value of  \fBPAM_USER\fR to  \fINULL\fR with  \fBpam_set_item()\fR before calling \fBpam_authenticate()\fR, if they want the user to be prompted for a new user name each time. The value of \fIuser\fR retrieved by \fBpam_get_user()\fR should not be modified or freed.  The item will be released by \fBpam_end()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES

.LP
Upon success, \fBpam_get_user()\fR returns  \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR; otherwise it returns an error code. Refer to \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for information on error related return values.
