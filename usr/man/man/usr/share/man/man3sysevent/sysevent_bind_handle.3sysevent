.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysevent_bind_handle()\fR function allocates memory associated with a subscription handle and binds it to the caller's \fIevent_handler\fR.  The \fIevent_handler\fR is invoked during subsequent system event notifications once a subscription has been made with \fBsysevent_subscribe_event\fR(3SYSEVENT).
.sp
.LP
The system event is represented by the argument \fIev\fR and is passed as an argument to the invoked event delivery function, \fIevent_handler\fR.
.sp
.LP
Additional threads are created to service communication between \fBsyseventd\fR(1M) and the calling process and to run the event handler routine, \fIevent_handler\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysevent_unbind_handle()\fR function deallocates memory and other resources associated with a subscription handle and deactivates all system event notifications for the calling process.  All event notifications are guaranteed to stop upon return from \fBsysevent_unbind_handle()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysevent_bind_handle()\fR function returns a valid \fBsysevent\fR subscriber handle if the handle is successfully allocated.  Otherwise, \fINULL\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysevent_unbind_handle()\fR function returns no value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysevent_bind_handle()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Event notifications are revoked by \fBsyseventd\fR when the bound process dies.  Event notification is suspended if a signal is caught and handled by the \fIevent_handler\fR thread.  Event notification is also suspended when the calling process attempts to use \fBfork\fR(2) or \fBfork1\fR(2).  Event notifications might be lost during suspension periods.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlibsysevent\fR interfaces do not work at all in non-global zones.
