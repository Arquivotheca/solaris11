.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBsasl_client_start()\fR interface to select a mechanism for authentication and start the authentication session. The \fImechlist\fR parameter holds the list of mechanisms that the client might like to use. The mechanisms in the list are not necessarily supported by the client, nor are the mechanisms necessarily valid. SASL determines which of the mechanisms to use based upon the security preferences specified earlier. The list of mechanisms is typically a list of mechanisms that the server supports, acquired from a capability request.
.sp
.LP
If \fBSASL_INTERACT\fR is returned, the library needs some values to be filled in before it can proceed. The \fIprompt_need\fR structure is filled in with requests. The application fullfills these requests and calls \fBsasl_client_start()\fR again with identical parameters. The \fIprompt_need\fR parameter is the same pointer as before, but it is filled in by the application.

.rt  
\fIclientout\fR and \fIclientoutlen\fR are created. They contain the initial client response to send to the server. It is the job of the client to send them over the network to the server. Any protocol specific encodingthat is necessary, for example \fBbase64\fR encoding, must be done by the client.
.sp
If the protocol lacks client-send-first capability, then set \fIclientout\fR to \fINULL\fR. If there is no initial client-send, then *\fIclientout\fR will be set to \fINULL\fR on return.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBsasl_client_start()\fR returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSASL_CONTINUE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The call to \fBsasl_client_start()\fR was successful, and more steps are needed in the authentication.
.RE

.sp
.LP
All other error codes indicate an error situation that must be handled, or the authentication session should be quit. See \fBsasl_errors\fR(3SASL) for information on SASL error codes.
