.SH NAME
pset_info \- get information about a processor set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/pset.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpset_info\fR(\fBpsetid_t\fR \fIpset\fR, \fBint *\fR\fItype\fR, \fBuint_t *\fR\fInumcpus\fR,
     \fBprocessorid_t *\fR\fIcpulist\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_info()\fR function returns information on the processor set \fIpset\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fItype\fR is non-null, then on successful completion the type of the processor set will be stored in the location pointed to by \fItype\fR. The only type supported for active processor sets is \fBPS_PRIVATE\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fInumcpus\fR is non-null, then on successful completion the number of processors in the processor set will be stored in the location pointed to by \fInumcpus\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fInumcpus\fR and \fIcpulist\fR are both non-null, then \fIcpulist\fR points to a buffer where a list of processors assigned to the processor set is to be stored, and \fInumcpus\fR points to the maximum number of processor IDs the buffer can hold. On successful completion, the list of processors up to the maximum buffer size is stored in the buffer pointed to by \fIcpulist\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_NONE\fR, the list of processors not assigned to any processor set will be stored in the buffer pointed to by \fIcpulist\fR, and the number of such processors will be stored in the location pointed to by \fInumcpus\fR. The location pointed to by \fItype\fR will be set to \fBPS_NONE\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_MYID\fR, the processor list and number of processors returned will be those of the processor set to which the caller is bound. If the caller is not bound to a processor set, the result will be equivalent to setting pset to \fBPS_NONE\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_info()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The location pointed to by \fItype\fR, \fInumcpus\fR, or \fIcpulist\fR was not null and not writable by the user.

.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
An invalid processor set \fBID\fR was specified.
.sp
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the processor is not a member of the zone's pool's processor set.
