.TH pipe 2 "23 Apr 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
pipe \- create an interprocess channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpipe\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR[2]);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpipe()\fR function creates an I/O mechanism called a pipe and returns two file descriptors, \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] and \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR]. The files associated with \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] and \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] are streams and are both opened for reading and writing.  The \fBO_NDELAY\fR, \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR, and \fBFD_CLOEXEC\fR flags are cleared on both file descriptors. The \fBfcntl\fR(2) function can be used to set these flags.
.sp
.LP
A read from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] accesses the data written to \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis and a read from \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] accesses the data written to \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] also on a \fBFIFO\fR basis.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion \fBpipe()\fR marks for update the \fBst_atime\fR, \fBst_ctime\fR, and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the pipe.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpipe()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEMFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
More than {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR} file descriptors are already in use by this process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The number of simultaneously open files in the system would exceed a system-imposed limit.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Since a pipe is bi-directional, there are two separate flows of data. Therefore, the size (\fBst_size\fR) returned by a call to \fBfstat\fR(2) with argument  \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] or \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] is the number of bytes available for reading from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] or \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] respectively. Previously, the size (\fBst_size\fR) returned by a call to \fBfstat()\fR with argument \fIfildes\fR[\fB1\fR] (the write-end) was the number of bytes available for reading from \fIfildes\fR[\fB0\fR] (the read-end).
