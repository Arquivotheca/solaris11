.SH NAME
_lwp_info \- return the time-accounting information of a single LWP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/lwp.h>

\fBint\fR \fB_lwp_info\fR(\fBstruct lwpinfo *\fR\fIbuffer\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB_lwp_info()\fR function fills the  \fBlwpinfo\fR structure pointed to by  \fIbuffer\fR with time-accounting information pertaining to the calling LWP. This call may be extended in the future to return other information to the  \fBlwpinfo\fR structure as needed.  The  \fBlwpinfo\fR structure in  <\fBsys/lwp.h\fR> includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
timestruc_t   lwp_utime;
timestruc_t   lwp_stime;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBlwp_utime\fR member is the CPU time used while executing instructions in the user space of the calling LWP.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlwp_stime\fR member is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of the calling LWP.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion,  \fB_lwp_info()\fR returns  \fB0\fR and fills in the \fBlwpinfo\fR structure pointed to by  \fIbuffer\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

If the following condition is detected,  \fB_lwp_info()\fR returns the corresponding value:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad

Additionally, the \fB_lwp_info()\fR function will fail for 32-bit interfaces if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The size of the \fBtv_sec\fR member of the \fBtimestruc_t\fR type pointed to by \fBlwp_utime\fR and \fBlwp_stime\fR is too small to contain the correct number of seconds.
