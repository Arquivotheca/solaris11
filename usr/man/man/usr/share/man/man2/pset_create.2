.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions control the creation and management of sets of processors.  Processor sets allow a subset of the system's processors to be set aside for exclusive use by specified \fBLWP\fRs and processes. The binding of \fBLWP\fRs and processes to processor sets is controlled by \fBpset_bind\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_create()\fR function creates an empty processor set that contains no processors.  On successful return, \fInewpset\fR will contain the \fBID\fR of the new processor set.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_destroy()\fR function destroys the processor set \fIpset\fR, releasing its constituent processors and processes. If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_MYID\fR, the processor set to which the caller is bound is destroyed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_assign()\fR function assigns the processor \fIcpu\fR to the processor set \fIpset\fR. A processor that has been assigned to a processor set will run only \fBLWP\fRs and processes that have been explicitly bound to that processor set, unless another \fBLWP\fR requires a resource that is only available on that processor. 
.sp
.LP
On successful return, if \fIopset\fR is non-null, \fIopset\fR will contain the processor set \fBID\fR of the former processor set of the processor.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_NONE\fR, \fBpset_assign()\fR releases processor \fIcpu\fR from its current processor set.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_QUERY\fR, \fBpset_assign()\fR makes no change to processor sets, but returns the current processor set \fBID\fR of processor \fIcpu\fR in \fIopset\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_MYID\fR, processor \fIcpu\fR is assigned to the processor set to which the caller belongs. If the caller does not belong to a processor set, processor \fIcpu\fR is released from its current processor set.
.sp
.LP
These functions are restricted to privileged processes, except for \fBpset_assign()\fR when \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_QUERY\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return \fB0\fR. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The location pointed to by \fInewpset\fR was not writable by the user, or the location pointed to by \fIopset\fR was not \fINULL\fR and not writable by the user.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The processor set type of \fBPS_SYSTEM\fR is no longer supported.
.sp
.LP
Processors with \fBLWP\fRs bound to them using \fBprocessor_bind\fR(2) cannot be assigned to a new processor set. If  this is attempted, \fBpset_assign()\fR will fail and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBEBUSY\fR.
