.SH NAME
semctl \- semaphore control operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsemctl\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsemid\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsemnum\fR, \fBint\fR \fIcmd\fR...);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsemctl()\fR function provides a variety of semaphore control operations as specified by \fIcmd\fR. The fourth argument is optional, depending upon the operation  requested.  If required, it is of type  \fBunion semun\fR, which must be explicitly declared by the application program.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
union semun {
        int             val;
        struct semid_ds *buf;
        ushort_t        *array;
} arg ;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The permission required for a semaphore operation is given as {\fItoken\fR}, where \fItoken\fR is the type of permission needed.  The types of permission are interpreted as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
00400    READ by user
00200    ALTER by user
00040    READ by group
00020    ALTER by group
00004    READ by others
00002    ALTER by others
.fi
.in -2

.LP
See the \fBSemaphore Operation Permissions\fR subsection of the \fBDEFINITIONS\fR section of \fBIntro\fR(2) for more information. The following semaphore operations as specified by \fIcmd\fR are executed with respect to the semaphore specified by \fIsemid\fR and \fIsemnum\fR.

.RE

.sp

\fB\fBIPC_SET\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n

.sp
.in +2
.nf
sem_perm.uid
sem_perm.gid
sem_perm.mode	/* access permission bits only */

.in -2

This command can be executed only by a process that has either the {\fBPRIV_IPC_OWNER\fR} privilege or an effective user \fBID\fR equal to the value of \fBmsg_perm.cuid\fR or \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR. Only a process with the {\fBPRIV_SYS_IPC_CONFIG\fR} privilege can raise the value of \fBmsg_qbytes\fR.

.RS 12n

Remove the semaphore identifier specified by \fIsemid\fR from the system and destroy the set of semaphores and data structure associated with it. This command can be executed only by a process that has the {\fBPRIV_IPC_OWNER\fR} privilege or an effective user \fBID\fR equal to the value of \fBsem_perm.cuid\fR or \fBsem_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated with \fIsemid\fR.
