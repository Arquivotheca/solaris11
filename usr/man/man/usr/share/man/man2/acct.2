.SH NAME
acct \- enable or disable process accounting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBacct\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBacct()\fR function enables or disables the system process accounting routine. If the routine is enabled, an accounting record will be written in an accounting file for each process that terminates. The termination of a process can be caused by either an \fBexit\fR(2) call or a \fBsignal\fR(3C)). The effective user \fBID\fR of the process calling \fBacct()\fR must have the appropriate privileges.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpath\fR argument points to the pathname of the accounting file, whose file format is described on the \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD) manual page.
.sp
.LP
The accounting routine is enabled if \fIpath\fR is non-zero and no errors occur during the function. It is disabled if \fIpath\fR is  \fB(char *)NULL\fR  and no errors occur during the function.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
