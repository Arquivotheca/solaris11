.SH NAME
utime \- set file access and modification times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <utime.h>

\fBint\fR \fButime\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR, \fBconst struct utimbuf *\fR\fItimes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fButime()\fR function sets the access and modification times of the file pointed to by \fIpath\fR,  and causes the time of the last file status change (\fBst_ctime\fR) to be updated.
.sp
.LP
If \fItimes\fR is \fINULL\fR, the access and modification times of the file are set to the current time. A process must be the owner of the file or have write permission to use \fButime()\fR in this manner.
.sp
.LP
If \fItimes\fR is not \fINULL\fR, \fItimes\fR is interpreted as a pointer to a \fButimbuf\fR structure (defined in <\fButime.h\fR>) and the access and modification times are set to the values contained in the designated structure. Only the owner of the file or a process that has the {\fBPRIV_FILE_OWNER\fR} privilege asserted in its effective set can use \fButime()\fR in this manner.
.sp
.LP
The \fButimbuf\fR structure contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
time_t   actime;    /* access time */
time_t   modtime;   /* modification time */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The times contained in the members of the \fButimbuf\fR structure are measured in seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
