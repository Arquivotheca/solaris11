.SH NAME
pset_bind \- bind LWPs to a set of processors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/pset.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpset_bind\fR(\fBpsetid_t\fR \fIpset\fR, \fBidtype_t\fR \fIidtype\fR, \fBid_t\fR \fIid\fR, \fBpsetid_t *\fR\fIopset\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_bind()\fR function binds the \fBLWP\fR or set of \fBLWPs\fR specified by \fIidtype\fR and \fIid\fR to the processor set specified by \fIpset\fR. If \fIopset\fR is not \fINULL\fR, \fBpset_bind()\fR sets the \fBpsetid_t\fR variable pointed to by \fIopset\fR to the previous processor set binding of one of the specified \fBLWP\fR, or to \fBPS_NONE\fR if the selected \fBLWP\fR was not bound.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_PID\fR, the binding affects all \fBLWP\fRs of the process with process \fBID\fR (PID) \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_LWPID\fR, the binding affects the \fBLWP\fR of the current process with \fBLWP ID\fR \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_TASKID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with task ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_PROJID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with project ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_ZONEID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with zone ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_CTID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with process contract ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIid\fR is \fBP_MYID\fR, the specified LWP, process, task, process, zone, or process contract is the current one.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_NONE\fR, the processor set bindings of the specified LWPs are cleared.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_QUERY\fR, the processor set bindings are not changed.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpset\fR is \fBPS_MYID\fR, the specified LWPs are bound to the same processor set as the caller. If the caller is not bound to a processor set, the processor set bindings are cleared.
.sp
.LP
The {\fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR} privilege must be asserted in the effective set of the calling process or \fIpset\fR must be \fBPS_QUERY\fR.
.sp
.LP
LWPs that have been bound to a processor with \fBprocessor_bind\fR(2) may also be bound to a processor set if the processor is part of the processor set. If this occurs, the binding to the processor remains in effect. If the processor binding is later removed, the processor set binding becomes effective.
.sp
.LP
Processor set bindings are inherited across \fBfork\fR(2) and \fBexec\fR(2).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_bind()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBUSY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
One of the \fBLWP\fRs is bound to a processor, and the specified processor set does not include that processor.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The location pointed to by \fIopset\fR was not \fINULL\fR and not writable by the user.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
An invalid processor set \fBID\fR was specified;  or \fIidtype\fR was not \fBP_PID\fR, \fBP_LWPID\fR, \fBP_PROJID\fR, \fBP_TASKID\fR, \fBP_ZONEID\fR, or \fBP_CTID\fR.

.rt  
The pools facility is active.  See \fBpooladm\fR(1M) and \fBpool_set_status\fR(3POOL) for information about enabling and disabling the pools facility. Processes can be bound to pools using the \fBpoolbind\fR(1M) utility or the \fBpool_set_binding\fR(3POOL) function.
.sp
Binding a system process to a processor set is not supported.

\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR

.RS 11n
.rt  
The {\fBPRIV_PROC_OWNER\fR} is not asserted in the effecive set of the calling process and either the real or effective user ID of the calling process does not match the real or effective user \fBID\fR of one of the LWPs being bound, or the processor set from which one or more of the LWPs are being unbound has the \fBPSET_NOESCAPE\fR attribute set and {\fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR) is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process. See \fBpset_setattr\fR(2) for more information about processor set attributes.
