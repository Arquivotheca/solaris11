.TH getpid 2 "27 Jan 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
getpid, getpgrp, getppid, getpgid \- get process, process group, and parent process IDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetpid\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetpgrp\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetppid\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBpid_t\fR \fBgetpgid\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpid()\fR function returns the process \fBID\fR of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpgrp()\fR function returns the process group \fBID\fR of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetppid()\fR function returns the parent process \fBID\fR of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpgid()\fR function returns the process group \fBID\fR of the process whose process \fBID\fR is equal to \fIpid,\fR or the process group \fBID\fR of the calling process, if \fIpid\fR is equal to 0.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpid()\fR, \fBgetpgrp()\fR, and \fBgetppid()\fR functions are always successful and no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBgetpgid()\fR returns the process group ID. Otherwise, \fBgetpgid()\fR returns \fB(pid_t)\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpgid()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The process whose process  \fBID\fR is equal to \fIpid\fR is not in the same session as the calling process, and the implementation does not allow access to the process group \fBID\fR of that process from the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
There is no process with a process \fBID\fR equal to \fIpid\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpgid()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of the \fIpid\fR argument is invalid.
