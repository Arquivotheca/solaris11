.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBuadmin()\fR function provides control for basic administrative functions. This function is tightly coupled to the system administrative procedures and is not intended for general use. The argument \fImdep\fR is provided for machine-dependent use and is not defined here. It should be initialized to \fINULL\fR if not used.
.sp
.LP
As specified by \fIcmd\fR, the following commands are available:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBA_SHUTDOWN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The system is shut down. All user processes are killed, the buffer cache is flushed, and the root file system is unmounted. The action to be taken after the system has been shut down is specified by \fIfcn\fR. The functions are generic; the hardware capabilities vary on  specific machines.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAD_CHECK_SUSPEND_TO_DISK\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAD_SUSPEND_TO_RAM\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

Check if your system supports suspend to memory. Without performing a system suspend/resume, this subcommand checks if this feature is currently available on your system.
.RE

The following subcommands, specified by \fIfcn\fR, are obsolete and might be removed in a subsequent release:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAD_COMPRESS\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Save the system state to the state file with compression of data. This subcommand has been replaced by \fBAD_SUSPEND_TO_DISK\fR, which should be used instead.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAD_CHECK\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check if your system supports suspend and resume.  Without performing a  system suspend/resume, this command checks if this feature is currently available on your system. This subcommand has been replaced by \fBAD_CHECK_SUSPEND_TO_DISK\fR, which should be used instead.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAD_FORCE\fR\fR
