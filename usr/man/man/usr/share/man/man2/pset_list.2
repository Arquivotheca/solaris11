.SH NAME
pset_list \- get list of processor sets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/pset.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpset_list\fR(\fBpsetid_t *\fR\fIpsetlist\fR, \fBuint_t *\fR\fInumpsets\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_list()\fR function returns a list of processor sets in the system.
.sp
.LP
If \fInumpsets\fR is non-null, then on successful completion the number of processor sets in the system will be stored in the location pointed to by \fInumpsets\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fInumpsets\fR and \fIpsetlist\fR are both non-null, then \fIpsetlist\fR points to a buffer where a list of processor sets in the system is to be stored, and \fInumpsets\fR points to the maximum number of processor set IDs the buffer can hold.  On successful completion, the list of processor sets up to the maximum buffer size is stored in the buffer pointed to by \fIpsetlist\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, -1  is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_list()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The location pointed to by \fIpsetlist\fR or \fInumpsets\fR was not null and not writable by the user.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
If the caller is in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, \fBpset_list()\fR returns only the processor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
