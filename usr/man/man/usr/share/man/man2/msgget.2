.SH NAME
msgget \- get message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/msg.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmsgget\fR(\fBkey_t\fR \fIkey\fR, \fBint\fR \fImsgflg\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmsgget()\fR argument returns the message queue identifier associated with \fIkey\fR.
.sp
.LP
A message queue identifier and associated message queue and data structure (see \fBIntro\fR(2)) are created for \fIkey\fR if one of the following are true:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIkey\fR is \fBIPC_PRIVATE\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIkey\fR does not already have a message queue identifier associated with it, and (\fImsgflg\fR\fB&IPC_CREAT\fR) is true.
.RE
.sp
.LP
On creation, the data structure associated with the new message queue identifier is initialized as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBmsg_perm.cuid\fR, \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR, \fBmsg_perm.cgid\fR, and \fBmsg_perm.gid\fR are set to the effective user \fBID\fR and effective group \fBID,\fR respectively, of the calling process.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The low-order 9 bits of \fBmsg_perm.mode\fR are set to the low-order 9 bits of \fImsgflg\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBmsg_qnum\fR, \fBmsg_lspid\fR, \fBmsg_lrpid\fR, \fBmsg_stime\fR, and \fBmsg_rtime\fR are set to 0.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBmsg_ctime\fR is set to the current time.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBmsg_qbytes\fR is set to the system limit. See NOTES.
.RE
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a non-negative integer representing a message queue identifier is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmsgget()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A message queue identifier exists for \fIkey\fR, but operation permission (see \fBIntro\fR(2)) as specified by the low-order 9 bits of \fImsgflg\fR would not be granted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEEXIST\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A message queue identifier exists for \fIkey\fR but (\fImsgflg\fR\fB&IPC_CREAT\fR) and (\fImsgflg\fR\fB&IPC_EXCL\fR) are both true.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOENT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A message queue identifier does not exist for \fIkey\fR and (\fImsgflg\fR\fB&IPC_CREAT\fR) is false.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A message queue identifier is to be created but the system-imposed limit on the maximum number of allowed message queue identifiers system wide would be exceeded. See NOTES.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The system-defined limit used to initialize \fBmsg_qbytes\fR is the minimum enforced value of the calling process's \fBprocess.max-msg-qbytes\fR resource control.
.sp
.LP
The system-imposed limit on the number of message queue identifiers is maintained on a per-project basis using the \fBproject.max-msg-ids\fR resource control. The \fBzone.max-msg-ids\fR resource control restricts the total amount of message queue identifiers that can be allocated by a zone.
.sp
.LP
See \fBrctladm\fR(1M) and \fBsetrctl\fR(2) for information about using resource controls.
