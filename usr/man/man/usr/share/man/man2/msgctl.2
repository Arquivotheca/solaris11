.SH NAME
msgctl \- message control operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/msg.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmsgctl\fR(\fBint\fR \fImsqid\fR, \fBint\fR \fIcmd\fR, \fBstruct msqid_ds *\fR\fIbuf\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmsgctl()\fR function provides a variety of message control operations as specified by \fIcmd\fR. The following \fIcmd\fRs are available:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBIPC_STAT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Place the current value of each member of the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR into the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR. The contents of this structure are defined in \fBIntro\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBIPC_SET\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Set the value of the following members of the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR to the corresponding value found in the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
msg_perm.uid
msg_perm.gid
msg_perm.mode /* access permission bits only */
msg_qbytes
.fi
.in -2

This command can be executed only by a process that has either the {\fBPRIV_IPC_OWNER\fR} privilege or an effective user \fBID\fR equal to the value of \fBmsg_perm.cuid\fR or \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR. Only a process with the {\fBPRIV_SYS_IPC_CONFIG\fR} privilege can raise the value of \fBmsg_qbytes\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBIPC_RMID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Remove the message queue identifier specified by \fImsqid\fR from the system and destroy the message queue and data structure associated with it. This \fIcmd\fR can only be executed by a process that has an effective user \fBID\fR either with appropriate privileges asserted in the effective set or equal to the value of \fBmsg_perm.cuid\fR or  \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR. The \fIbuf\fR argument is ignored.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmsgctl()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmsgctl()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIcmd\fR argument is \fBIPC_STAT\fR and operation permission is denied to the calling process (see \fBIntro\fR(2)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIbuf\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fImsqid\fR argument is not a valid message queue identifier; or the \fIcmd\fR argument is not a valid command or is \fBIPC_SET\fR and \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR or \fBmsg_perm.gid\fR is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIcmd\fR argument is \fBIPC_STAT\fR and \fIuid\fR or \fIgid\fR is too large to be stored in the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIcmd\fR argument is \fBIPC_RMID\fR or \fBIPC_SET\fR, the {\fBPRIV_SYS_IPC_OWNER\fR} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process, and is not equal to the value of \fBmsg_perm.cuid\fR or \fBmsg_perm.uid\fR in the data structure associated with \fImsqid\fR.
.sp
The \fIcmd\fR argument is \fBIPC_SET,\fR an attempt is being made to increase to the value of \fBmsg_qbytes\fR, and the {\fBPRIV_SYS_IPC_CONFIG\fR} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
