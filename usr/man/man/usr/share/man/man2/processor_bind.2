processor_bind \- bind LWPs to a processor
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/processor.h>
#include <sys/procset.h>

\fBint\fR \fBprocessor_bind\fR(\fBidtype_t\fR \fIidtype\fR, \fBid_t\fR \fIid\fR, \fBprocessorid_t\fR \fIprocessorid\fR,
     \fBprocessorid_t *\fR\fIobind\fR);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBprocessor_bind()\fR function binds the LWP (lightweight process) or set of LWPs specified by \fIidtype\fR and \fIid\fR to the processor specified by  \fIprocessorid\fR. If \fIobind\fR is not \fINULL\fR, this function also sets the \fBprocessorid_t\fR variable pointed to by \fIobind\fR to the previous binding of one of the specified LWPs, or to \fBPBIND_NONE\fR if the selected LWP was not bound.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_PID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of the process with process ID (PID) \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_LWPID\fR, the binding affects the LWP of the current process with LWP ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_TASKID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with task ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_PROJID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with project ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_CTID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with process contract ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIidtype\fR is \fBP_ZONEID\fR, the binding affects all LWPs of all processes with zone ID \fIid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIid\fR is \fBP_MYID\fR, the specified LWP, process, task, or project is the current one.
.sp
.LP
If \fIprocessorid\fR is \fBPBIND_NONE\fR, the processor bindings of the specified LWPs are cleared.
.sp
.LP
If  \fIprocessorid\fR is \fBPBIND_QUERY\fR, the processor bindings are not changed.
.sp
.LP
The {\fBPRIV_PROC_OWNER\fR} privilege must be asserted in the effective set of the calling process or the real or effective user ID of the calling process must match the real or effective user ID of the \fBLWP\fRs being bound.  If the calling process does not have permission to change all of the specified LWPs, the bindings of the LWPs for which it does have permission will be changed even though an error is returned.
.sp
.LP
Processor bindings are inherited across \fBfork\fR(2) and \fBexec\fR(2).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and  \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
