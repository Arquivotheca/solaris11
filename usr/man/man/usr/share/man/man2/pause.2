.SH NAME
pause \- suspend process until signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpause\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpause()\fR function suspends the calling process until it receives a signal. The signal must be one that is not currently set to be ignored by the calling process.
.sp
.LP
If the signal causes termination of the calling process, \fBpause()\fR does not return.
.sp
.LP
If the signal is caught by the calling process and control is returned from the signal-catching function (see \fBsignal\fR(3C)), the calling process resumes execution from the point of suspension.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Since \fBpause()\fR suspends thread  execution indefinitely unless interrupted by a signal, there is no successful completion return value.  If interrupted, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpause()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
A signal is caught by the calling process and control is returned from the signal-catching function.
