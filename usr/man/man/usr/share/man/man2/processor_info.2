.SH NAME
processor_info \- determine type and status of a processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/processor.h>

\fBint\fR \fBprocessor_info\fR(\fBprocessorid_t\fR \fIprocessorid\fR, \fBprocessor_info_t *\fR\fIinfop\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBprocessor_info()\fR function returns the status of the processor specified by \fIprocessorid\fR in the \fBprocessor_info_t\fR structure pointed to by \fIinfop\fR.
.sp
.LP
The structure \fBprocessor_info_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int      pi_state;
char     pi_processor_type[PI_TYPELEN];
char     pi_fputypes[PI_FPUTYPE];
int      pi_clock;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_state\fR member is the current state of the processor, either \fBP_ONLINE\fR, \fBP_OFFLINE\fR, \fBP_NOINTR\fR, \fBP_FAULTED\fR, \fBP_SPARE\fR, or \fBP_POWEROFF\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_processor_type\fR member is a null-terminated ASCII string specifying the type of the processor.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_fputypes\fR member is a null-terminated ASCII string containing the comma-separated types of floating-point units (FPUs) attached to the processor. This string will be empty if no FPU is attached.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_clock\fR member is the processor clock frequency rounded to the nearest megahertz. It may be  \fB0\fR if not known.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise,  \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and  \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBprocessor_info()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
An non-existent processor \fBID\fR was specified.
.sp
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the processor is not a member of the zone's pool's processor set.

\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The  \fBprocessor_info_t\fR structure pointed to by  \fIinfop\fR was not writable by the user.
