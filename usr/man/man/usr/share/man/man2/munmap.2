.TH munmap 2 "5 Jan 1998" "SunOS 5.11" "System Calls"
.SH NAME
munmap \- unmap pages of memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/mman.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmunmap\fR(\fBvoid *\fR\fIaddr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIlen\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmunmap()\fR function removes the mappings for pages in the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR), rounding the \fIlen\fR argument up to the next multiple of the page size as returned by \fBsysconf\fR(3C). If \fIaddr\fR is not the address of a mapping established by a prior call to \fBmmap\fR(2), the behavior is undefined. After a successful call to \fBmunmap()\fR and before any subsequent mapping of the unmapped pages, further references to these pages will result in the delivery of a \fBSIGBUS\fR or \fBSIGSEGV\fR signal to the process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmmap\fR(2) function often performs an implicit \fBmunmap()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmunmap()\fR returns \fB0\fR; otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmunmap()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The  \fIaddr\fR argument is not a multiple of the page size as returned by \fBsysconf\fR(3C); addresses in the range [\fIaddr, addr + len\fR) are outside the valid range for the address space of a process; or the  \fIlen\fR argument has a value less than or equal to \fB0\fR.
