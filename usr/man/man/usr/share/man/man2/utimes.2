.SH NAME
utimes, futimesat \- set file access and modification times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

#include <sys/time.h> 

\fBint\fR \fButimes\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR, \fBconst struct timeval\fR \fItimes\fR[2]);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBfutimesat\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR,
     \fBconst struct timeval\fR \fItimes\fR[2]);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fButimes()\fR function sets the access and modification times of the file pointed to by the \fIpath\fR argument to the value of the \fItimes\fR argument. It allows time specifications accurate to the microsecond.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfutimesat()\fR function also sets access and modification times.  See \fBfsattr\fR(5). If \fIpath\fR is a relative path name, however, \fBfutimesat()\fR resolves the path relative to the \fIfildes\fR argument rather than the current working directory.  If \fIfildes\fR is set to \fBAT_FDCWD\fR, defined in <\fBfcntl.h\fR>, \fBfutimesat()\fR resolves the path relative to the current working directory.  If \fIpath\fR is a null pointer, \fBfutimesat()\fR sets the access and modification times on the file referenced by \fIfildes\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument is ignored even when \fBfutimesat()\fR is provided with an absolute path.
.sp
.LP
The \fItimes\fR argument is an array of \fBtimeval\fR structures. The first array member represents the date and time of last access, and the second member represents the date and time of last modification.  The times in the \fBtimeval\fR structure are measured in seconds and microseconds since the Epoch, although rounding toward the nearest second may occur.
.sp
.LP
If the \fItimes\fR argument is a null pointer, the access and modification times of the file are set to the current time.  The effective user \fBID\fR of the process must be the same as the owner of the file, or must have write access to the file or the {\fBPRIV_FILE_OWNER\fR} privilege to use this call in this manner. Upon completion, \fButimes()\fR will mark the time of the last file status change, \fBst_ctime\fR, for update.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned, \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error, and the file times will not be affected.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fButimes()\fR and \fBfutimesat()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Search permission is denied by a component of the path prefix; or the \fItimes\fR argument is a null pointer and the effective user \fBID\fR of the process does not match the owner of the file and write access is denied.
