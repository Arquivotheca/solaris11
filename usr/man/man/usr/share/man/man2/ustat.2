.SH NAME
ustat \- get file system statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <ustat.h>

\fBint\fR \fBustat\fR(\fBdev_t\fR \fIdev\fR, \fBstruct ustat *\fR\fIbuf\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBustat()\fR function returns information about a mounted file system.  The \fIdev\fR argument is a device number identifying a device containing a mounted file system (see \fBmakedev\fR(3C)). The \fIbuf\fR argument is a pointer to a \fBustat\fR structure that includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
daddr_t  f_tfree;      /* Total free blocks */
ino_t    f_tinode;     /* Number of free inodes */
char     f_fname[6];   /* Filsys name */
char     f_fpack[6];   /* Filsys pack name */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBf_fname\fR and \fBf_fpack\fR members may not contain significant information on all systems; in this case, these members will contain the null character as the first character.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise,  \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBustat()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBECOMM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIdev\fR argument is on a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer active.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIbuf\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
A signal was caught during the execution of the \fBustat()\fR function.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIdev\fR argument is not the device number of a device containing a mounted file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOLINK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The \fIdev\fR argument refers to a device on a remote machine and the link  to that machine is no longer active.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
One of the values returned cannot be represented in the structure pointed to by \fIbuf\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBstatvfs\fR(2) function should be used in favor of \fBustat()\fR.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
.LP
\fBstat\fR(2), \fBstatvfs\fR(2), \fBmakedev\fR(3C), \fBlfcompile\fR(5)
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The \fBNFS\fR revision 2 protocol does not permit the number of free files to be provided to the client; therefore, when \fBustat()\fR has completed on an \fBNFS\fR file system, \fBf_tinode\fR is always \fB\(mi1\fR\&.
