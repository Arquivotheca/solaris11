.SH NAME
chdir, fchdir \- change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBchdir\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBfchdir\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBchdir()\fR and \fBfchdir()\fR functions cause a directory pointed to by \fIpath\fR or \fIfildes\fR to become the current working directory.  The starting point for path searches for path names not beginning with \fB/\fR (slash). The \fIpath\fR argument points to the path name of a directory. The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor of a directory.
.sp
.LP
For a directory to become the current directory, a process must have execute (search) access to the directory.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned, the current working directory is unchanged, and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
