.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigwait()\fR function selects a signal in \fIset\fR that is pending on the calling thread. If no signal in \fIset\fR is pending, \fBsigwait()\fR blocks until a signal in \fIset\fR becomes pending. The selected signal is cleared from the set of signals pending on the calling thread and the number of the signal is returned, or in the standard-conforming version (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) placed in \fIsig\fR. The selection of a signal in \fIset\fR is independent of the signal mask of the calling thread. This means a thread can synchronously wait for signals that are being blocked by the signal mask of the calling thread \&. To ensure that only the caller receives the signals defined in \fIset\fR, all threads should have signals in \fIset\fR masked including the calling thread.
.sp
.LP
If more than one thread is using \fBsigwait()\fR to wait for the same signal, no more than one of these threads returns from \fBsigwait()\fR with the signal number. If more than a single thread is blocked in \fBsigwait()\fR for a signal when that signal is generated for the process, it is unspecified which of the waiting threads returns from \fBsigwait()\fR. If the signal is generated for a specific thread, as by \fBpthread_kill\fR(3C), only that thread returns.
.sp
.LP
Should any of the multiple pending signals in the range \fBSIGRTMIN\fR to \fBSIGRTMAX\fR be selected, it will be the lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the default version of \fBsigwait()\fR returns a signal number; the standard-conforming version returns \fB0\fR and stores the received signal number at the location pointed to by \fIsig\fR. Otherwise, the default version returns -1 and sets errno to indicate an error; the standard-conforming version returns an error number to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigwait()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIset\fR argument points to an invalid address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIset\fR argument contains an unsupported signal number.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCreating a thread to handle receipt of a signal
.sp
.LP
The following sample C code creates a thread to handle the receipt of a signal. More specifically, it catches the asynchronously generated signal, \fBSIGINT\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigwait()\fR function cannot be used to wait for signals that cannot be caught (see \fBsigaction\fR(2)). This restriction is silently imposed by the system.
.sp
.LP
Solaris 2.4 and earlier releases provided a \fBsigwait()\fR facility as specified in POSIX.1c Draft 6. The final POSIX.1c standard changed the interface as described above. Support for the Draft 6 interface is provided for compatibility only and may not be supported in future releases. New applications and libraries should use the standard-conforming interface.
