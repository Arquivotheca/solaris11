.SH NAME
times \- get process and child process times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/times.h>
#include <limits.h>

\fBclock_t\fR \fBtimes\fR(\fBstruct tms *\fR\fIbuffer\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimes()\fR function fills the \fBtms\fR structure pointed to by \fIbuffer\fR with time-accounting information. The \fBtms\fR structure, defined in \fB<sys/times.h>\fR, contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
clock_t    tms_utime;
clock_t    tms_stime;
clock_t    tms_cutime;
clock_t    tms_cstime;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
All times are reported in clock ticks. The specific value for a clock tick is defined by the variable \fBCLK_TCK\fR, found in the header <\fBlimits.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
The times of a terminated child process are included in the \fBtms_cutime\fR and \fBtms_cstime\fR members of the parent when \fBwait\fR(3C) or \fBwaitpid\fR(3C) returns the process \fBID\fR of this terminated child.  If a child process has not waited for its children, their times will not be included in its times.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtms_utime\fR member is the \fBCPU\fR time used while executing instructions in the user space of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtms_stime\fR member is the \fBCPU\fR time used by the system on behalf of the calling process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtms_cutime\fR member is the sum of the \fBtms_utime\fR and the \fBtms_cutime\fR of the child processes.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtms_cstime\fR member is the sum of the \fBtms_stime\fR and the \fBtms_cstime\fR of the child processes.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtimes()\fR returns the elapsed real time, in clock ticks, since an arbitrary point in the past (for example, system start-up time). This point does not change from one invocation of \fBtimes()\fR within the process to another. The return value may overflow the possible range of type \fBclock_t\fR. If \fBtimes()\fR fails, \fB(clock_t)\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimes()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIbuffer\fR argument points to an illegal address.
