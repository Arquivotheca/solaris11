.SH NAME
updaters \- configuration file for NIS updating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/var/yp/updaters\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/var/yp/updaters\fR is a makefile (see \fBmake\fR(1S)) which is used for updating the Network Information Service (NIS) databases. Databases can only be updated in a secure network, that is, one that has a \fBpublickey\fR(4) database. Each entry in the file is a make target for a particular \fBNIS\fR database. For example, if there is an \fBNIS\fR database named \fBpasswd.byname\fR that can be updated, there should be a \fBmake\fR target named \fBpasswd.byname\fR in the \fBupdaters\fR file with the command to update the file.

The information necessary to make the update is passed to the update command through standard input. The information passed is described below (all items are followed by a \fBNEWLINE\fR except for 4 and 6):

After receiving this information through standard input, the command  to update the particular database determines whether the user is  allowed to make the change.  If not, it exits with the status \fBYPERR_ACCESS.\fR If the user is allowed to make the change, the command makes the  change and exits with a status of zero. If there are any errors that may prevent the  \fBupdaters\fR from making the change, it should exit with the status that matches a valid \fBNIS\fR error code described in \fB<rpcsvc/ypclnt.h>\fR\&.
