\fB/etc/ssh/ssh_config\fR
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB$HOME/.ssh/config\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The first \fBssh_config\fR path, above, provides the system-wide defaults for \fBssh\fR(1). The second version is user-specific defaults for \fBssh\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBssh\fR obtains configuration data from the following sources, in this order: command line options, user's configuration file (\fB$HOME/.ssh/config\fR), and system-wide configuration file (\fB/etc/ssh/ssh_config\fR). For each parameter, the first obtained value is used. The configuration files contain sections bracketed by \fBHost\fR specifications, and that section is applied only for hosts that match one of the patterns given in the specification. The matched host name is the one given on the command line.
.sp
.LP
Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.
.sp
.LP
The configuration file has the following format and syntax:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fR are comments.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Non-commented lines are of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIkeyword\fR \fIarguments\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Configuration options can be separated by white space or optional whitespace and exactly one equal sign. The latter format allows you to avoid the need to quote white space when specifying configuration options using the \fB-o\fR option to \fBssh\fR, \fBscp\fR, and \fBsftp\fR.

\fB\fBBatchMode\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. If set to \fByes\fR, passphrase/password querying is disabled. This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where you have no user to supply the password.

\fB\fBBindAddress\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the interface to transmit from on machines with multiple interfaces or aliased addresses. This option does not work if \fBUsePrivilegedPort\fR is set to \fByes\fR.

\fB\fBCheckHostIP\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
If this flag is set to \fByes\fR, \fBssh\fR additionally checks the host IP address in the \fBknown_hosts\fR file. This allows \fBssh\fR to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing. If the option is set to \fBno\fR, the check is not executed.

\fB\fBCipher\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session in protocol version 1. Only a single cipher can be specified. Currently, \fBblowfish, 3des,\fR and \fBdes\fR are supported. \fB3des\fR (triple-\fBdes\fR) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three different keys. It is believed to be secure. \fBblowfish\fR is a fast block cipher. It appears very secure and is much faster than \fB3des\fR. \fBdes\fR is only supported in the \fBssh\fR client for interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support the \fB3des\fR cipher. Its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses. The default is \fB3des\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBCiphers\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2 in order of preference. Multiple ciphers must be comma separated. 
.sp
The default cipher list contains all supported ciphers in this order: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, arcfour128, 
arcfour256, arcfour, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, 
3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc
.fi
.in -2
.sp

While CBC modes are not considered as secure as other modes in connection with the SSH protocol 2 they are present at the back of the default client cipher list for backward compatibility with SSH servers that do not support other cipher modes.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
If set to \fByes\fR, disables the display of the banner message. If set to \fBin-exec-mode\fR, disables the display of banner message when in remote command mode only. 
.sp
The default value is \fBno\fR, which means that the banner is displayed unless the log level is \fBQUIET\fR, \fBFATAL\fR, or \fBERROR\fR. See also the \fBBanner\fR option in \fBsshd_config\fR(4). This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

\fB\fBDynamicForward\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel. The application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.
.sp
The argument must be \fB[\fR\fIbind_address\fR\fB:]\fR\fIport\fR. IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets or by using an alternative syntax: \fB[\fR\fIbind_address\fR\fB/]\fR\fIport\fR. By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the \fBGatewayPorts\fR setting. However, an explicit \fIbind_address\fR can be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The \fIbind_address\fR of \fBlocalhost\fR indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or \fB*\fR indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
.sp
Currently the \fBSOCKS4\fR and \fBSOCKS5\fR protocols are supported, and \fBssh\fR acts as a \fBSOCKS\fR server. Multiple forwardings can be specified and additional forwardings can be specified on the command line. Only a user with enough privileges can forward privileged ports.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) is forwarded to the remote machine. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fBno\fR.
.sp
Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent through the forwarded connection. An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however he can perform operations on the keys that enable him to authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.

.RS 4n
Specifies whether X11 connections are automatically redirected over the secure channel and \fBDISPLAY\fR set. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fBno\fR.
.sp
X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X authorization database) can access the local \fBX11\fR display through the forwarded connection. An attacker might then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring. See the \fBForwardX11Trusted\fR option for more information how to prevent this.

\fB\fBForwardX11Trusted\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
If this option is set to \fByes\fR, remote X11 clients have full access to the original X11 display. This option is set to \fByes\fR by default.
.sp
If this option is set to \fBno\fR, remote X11 clients are considered untrusted and prevented from stealing or tampering with data belonging to trusted X11 clients. Furthermore, the \fBxauth\fR(1) token used for the session is set to expire after 20 minutes. Remote clients are refused access after this time.

\fB\fBGatewayPorts\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports. By default, \fBssh\fR binds local port forwardings to the loopback address. This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports. \fBGatewayPorts\fR can be used to specify that \fBssh\fR should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fBno\fR.

Enables/disables GSS-API-authenticated key exchanges. The default is \fByes\fR.
.sp
This option is intended primarily to allow users to disable the use of GSS-API key exchange for SSHv2 when it would otherwise be selected and then fail (due to server misconfiguration, for example). SSHv2 key exchange failure always results in disconnection.
.sp
This option also enables the use of the GSS-API to authenticate the user to the server after the key exchange. GSS-API key exchange can succeed but the subsequent authentication using the GSS-API fail if the server does not authorize the user's GSS principal name to the target user account.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the number of server alive messages which can be sent without \fBssh\fR(1) receiving messages back from the server. If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent, \fBssh\fR disconnects from the server, terminating the session. The use of server alive messages differs from \fBTCPKeepAlive\fR. Server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and are not spoofable. The TCP keep alive option enabled by \fBTCPKeepAlive\fR is spoofable. The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
.sp
The default value is 3. If, for example, \fBServerAliveInterval\fR is set to 15 and \fBServerAliveCountMax\fR is left at the default, \fBssh\fR disconnects in 45-60 seconds if the server becomes unresponsive. This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

.RS 4n
Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, \fBssh\fR(1) sends a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server. The default is 0, indicating that these messages are not sent to the server. This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

\fB\fBStrictHostKeyChecking\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
If this flag is set to \fByes\fR, \fBssh\fR never automatically adds host keys to the \fB$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts\fR file, and refuses to connect hosts whose host key has changed. This provides maximum protection against trojan horse attacks. However, it can be a source of inconvenience if you do not have good \fB/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\fR files installed and frequently connect new hosts. This option forces the user to manually add any new hosts. Normally this option is disabled, and new hosts are automatically added to the known host files. The host keys of known hosts are verified automatically in either case. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR or \fBask\fR. The default is \fBask\fR.

\fB\fBTrustedAnchorKeystore\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a directory where certificates of trusted anchors are located. Those certificates are used to validate host certificates if used as host keys. 
.sp
Currently only one level certificate chains are supported. This means that certificates must be signed by a private key that corresponds to a certificate located in the directory set by this option. Host key certificates can be self-signed as well. See the \fBUsing X.509 Certificates\fR section in the \fBsshd\fR(1M) man page.

.RS 4n
Specifies whether \fBssh\fR should use the OpenSSL PKCS#11 engine for offloading cryptographic operations to the Cryptographic Framework. Cryptographic operations are accelerated according to the available installed plug-ins. When no suitable plug-ins are present this option does not have an effect. The default is \fByes\fR.

Specifies whether to use a privileged port for outgoing connections. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fByes\fR. Setting this option to \fBno\fR turns off \fBRhostsAuthentication\fR and \fBRhostsRSAAuthentication\fR. If set to \fByes\fR \fBssh\fR must be \fBsetuid\fR root. Defaults to \fBno\fR.

All other options (except \fBHostName\fR) are ignored if this has been specified. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR.
