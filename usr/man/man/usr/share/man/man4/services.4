The \fBservices\fR file  is a local source of information regarding each service available through the Internet. The \fBservices\fR file can be used in conjunction with or instead of other services sources, including the \fBNIS\fR maps "services.byname". Programs use the \fBgetservbyname\fR(3SOCKET) routines to access this information.
.sp
.LP
The \fBservices\fR file contains an entry for each service. Each entry has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIservice-name   port\fR/\fIprotocol   aliases\fR
.fi
.in -2
