.SH NAME
ib \- InfiniBand device driver configuration files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The InfiniBand (IB) bus is an I/O transport based on switched  fabrics. IB devices are managed by the \fBib\fR(7D) nexus driver. There are three categories of InfiniBand devices:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
IB  port/IB VPPA/IB HCA_SVC devices
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
IB IOC devices
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
IB Pseudo devices
.RE
.sp
.LP
The IB  port/IB VPPA/IB HCA_SVC devices are enumerated by way of the \fBib.conf\fR file. See \fBib\fR(7D). 
.sp
.LP
The IB IOC devices are enumerated using the InfiniBand Device management class. See \fBibdm\fR(7D). 
.sp
.LP
For devices not in these two categories, most notably IB Pseudo devices, the driver must provide configuration files to inform the system of the IB  devices to be created. Configuration parameters are represented in the form of name value pairs you can retrieve using the DDI property interfaces. See \fBddi_prop_op\fR(9F) for details.
.sp
.LP
Configuration files for IB device drivers must identify the parent driver explicitly as \fBib\fR, and must create a string array property called \fBunit-address\fR which is unique to this entry in the configuration file. Drivers name \fBibport\fR and \fBioc\fR are reserved by \fBib\fR(7D) and should not be used.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the configuration file creates a prototype \fBdevinfo\fR node. Each node is assigned a unit address which is determined by the value of the \fBunit-address\fR  property. This property is only applicable to children of the IB parent and is required. See \fBdriver.conf\fR(4) for further details on configuration file syntax. 
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Example 1: Sample configuration file
.sp
.LP
Here is a configuration file called \fBibgen.conf\fR for an IB  device driver that implements a generic IB driver. This file creates a node called \fBibgen\fR.
