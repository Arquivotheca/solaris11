.SH NAME
bart_manifest \- system audit manifest file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbart\fR(1M) command generates a manifest that describes the contents of a managed host. A manifest consists of a header and entries. Each entry represents a single file. Entries are sorted in ascending order by file name. Any nonstandard file names, such as those that contain embedded newline or tab characters, have the special characters quoted prior to being sorted. See \fBQuoting Syntax\fR.
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with \fB!\fR supply metadata about the manifest. The manifest version line indicates the manifest specification version. The date line shows the date on which the manifest was created, in \fBdate\fR(1) form.
.sp
.LP
Some lines are ignored by the manifest comparison tool. Ignored lines include blank lines, lines that consist only of white space, and comments that begin with \fB#\fR.
.sp
.LP
In addition to metadata lines, the header contains the format comment block. This comment block lists the attributes reported for each file type.
.sp
.LP
To see the format of a manifest file, see \fBEXAMPLES\fR.
.SS "Manifest File Entries"
.sp
.LP
Each manifest file entry is a single line of one of the following forms, depending on the file type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIfname\fR D \fIsize mode acl dirmtime uid gid\fR 
\fIfname\fR P \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid\fR
\fIfname\fR S \fIsize mode acl mtime uid gid\fR

.SS "Quoting Syntax"
.sp
.LP
The rules file supports a quoting syntax for representing nonstandard file names.
.sp
.LP
When generating a manifest for file names that embeded TAB, SPACE, or NEWLINE characters, the special characters are encoded in their octal forms.
