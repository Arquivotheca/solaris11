.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrdc.cf\fR is an optional configuration file that supplies the \fBsndradm\fR(1M) command with details of the volume sets to be operated on. Inrdc.cf, the volume sets and  their host locations are defined in the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
post pdevice pbitmap shost sdevice sbitmap protocol mode options
.fi
.in -2

Remote Mirror operating mode. Sync is the Remote Mirror mode where  the  I/O operation is not confirmed as complete until the remote volume has been updated. Async is the  other Remote Mirror mode, in which the primary host I/O operation is confirmed as complete  before  updating the remote volume.

A consistency group name can be specified using the  g character. A disk queue volume partition can be specified using the q character, using full  path  name only (/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s5). Without the q character set will default  to  memory  base  queue.  When  running on a clustered system, a cluster resource group tag can be specified using the C character.
.sp
These options have the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[g io_groupname] [q queue_volume][C ctag]
.fi
.in -2

.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
When running on a cluster configuration, the cluster resource group tag is appended to the Remote Mirror set by default.
