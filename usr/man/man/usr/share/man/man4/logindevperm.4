.SH NAME
logindevperm, fbtab \- login-based device permissions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/logindevperm\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR file contains information that is used by \fBlogin\fR(1) and \fBttymon\fR(1M) to change the owner, group, and permissions of devices upon logging into or out of a console device. By default, this file contains lines for the keyboard, mouse, audio, and frame buffer devices.
.sp
.LP
The owner of the devices listed in \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR is set to the owner of the console by \fBlogin\fR(1). The group of the devices is set to the owner's group specified in \fB/etc/passwd\fR. The permissions are set as specified in \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the console is \fB/dev/vt/active\fR, the owner of the devices is the first user logged in on the consoles (\fB/dev/console\fR or \fB/dev/vt/#\fR). Upon this first user's logout the owner and group of these devices is reset by \fBttymon\fR(1M) to owner root and root's group as specified in \fB/etc/passwd\fR.
.sp
.LP
Fields are separated by a TAB or SPACE characters. Blank lines and comments can appear anywhere in the file; comments start with a hashmark, (\fB#\fR), and continue to the end of the line.
.sp
.LP
The first field specifies the name of a console device (for example, \fB/dev/console\fR). By default, it is \fB/dev/vt/active\fR, which points to the current active console, including \fB/dev/console\fR and all virtual consoles (\fB/dev/vt/#\fR). The second field specifies the permissions to which the devices in the \fIdevice_list\fR field (third field) are set. These permissions must be expressed in octal format, for example, \fB0774\fR. A \fIdevice_list\fR is a colon-separated list of device names. A device name must be a \fB/dev\fR link. 
.sp
.LP
A directory or logical name in the device name can be either one of the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A fully qualified name, for example, \fBfbs\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A regular expression, for example, \fB[a-z0-9.]+\fR. See \fBregexp\fR(5) for more information on regular expressions.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The wildcard character \fB*\fR specifying all directory or node names (except \fB\&.\fR and \fB\&..\fR, for example, \fB/dev/fbs/*\fR specifies all frame buffer devices.
.RE

Some examples of \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR file entries include:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/dev/usb/[0-9a-f]+[.][0-9a-f]+/[0-9]+/[a-z0-9.]+
/dev/usb/[0-9a-f]+[.][0-9a-f]+/[0-9]+/*
/dev/usb/[0-9a-f]+[.][0-9a-f]+/*/*
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Specify all \fBugen\fR(7D) endpoints and status nodes.
.sp
.LP
Drivers can also be specified to limit the permission changes to minor nodes owned by the specified drivers. For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/dev/console    0600    /dev/usb/[0-9a-f]+[.][0-9a-f]+/[0-9]+/* \e
driver=usb_mid,scsa2usb,usbprn  # libusb devices
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Due to the persistence of \fBdevfs\fR(7FS) minor node management, the user should be logged in as root if the list of minor nodes will be reduced and the devices should all be plugged in.
.sp
.LP
Once the devices are owned by the user, their permissions and ownership can be changed using \fBchmod\fR(1) and \fBchown\fR(1), as with any other user-owned file.
.sp
.LP
Upon logout the owner and group of these devices are reset by \fBttymon\fR(1M) to owner \fBroot\fR and root's group as specified in \fB/etc/passwd\fR (typically \fBother\fR). The permissions are set as specified in the \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR file.
