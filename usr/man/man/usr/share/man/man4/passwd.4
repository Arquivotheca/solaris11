.SH NAME
passwd \- password file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/passwd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/etc/passwd\fR is a local source of information about users' accounts. The password file can be used in conjunction with other naming sources, such as the \fBNIS\fR maps \fBpasswd.byname\fR or password data stored on an LDAP server. Programs use the \fBgetpwnam\fR(3C) routines to access this information.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBpasswd\fR entry is a single line of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIusername\fR\fB:\fR\fIpassword\fR\fB:\fR\fIuid\fR\fB:\fR
\fIgid\fR\fB:\fR\fIgcos-field\fR\fB:\fR\fIhome-dir\fR\fB:\fR
\fIlogin-shell\fR 
.fi
.in -2

.sp

\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
is the user's login name.
.sp
The login (\fBlogin\fR) and role (\fBrole\fR) fields accept a string of no more than eight bytes consisting of characters from the set of alphabetic characters, numeric characters, period (\fB\&.\fR), underscore (\fB_\fR), and hyphen (\fB-\fR). The first character should be alphabetic and the field should contain at least one lower case alphabetic character. A warning message is displayed if these restrictions are not met.
.sp
The \fBlogin\fR and \fBrole\fR fields must contain at least one character and must not contain a colon (\fB:\fR) or a newline (\fB\en\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
is an empty field. The encrypted password for the user is in the corresponding entry in the \fB/etc/shadow\fR file. \fBpwconv\fR(1M) relies on a special value of '\fBx\fR' in the password field of \fB/etc/passwd\fR. If this value of '\fBx\fR' exists in the password field of \fB/etc/passwd\fR, this indicates that the password for the user is already in \fB/etc/shadow\fR and should not be modified.

.LP
The maximum value of the \fIuid\fR and \fIgid\fR fields is \fB2147483647\fR. To maximize interoperability and compatibility, administrators are recommended to assign users a range of \fBUID\fRs and \fBGID\fRs below \fB60000\fR where possible. (\fBUID\fRs from \fB0\fR-\fB99\fR inclusive are reserved by the operating system vendor for use in future applications. Their use by end system users or vendors of layered products is not supported and may cause security related issues with future applications.)
.sp
.LP
The password file is an \fBASCII\fR file that resides in the \fB/etc\fR directory. Because the encrypted passwords on a secure system are always kept in the \fBshadow\fR file, \fB/etc/passwd\fR has general read permission on all systems and can be used by routines that map between numerical user \fBID\fRs and user names.
.sp
.LP
Blank lines are treated as malformed entries in the \fBpasswd\fR file and cause consumers of the file, such as \fBgetpwnam\fR(3C), to fail.
.sp
.LP
The password file can contain entries beginning with a `+' (plus sign) or '-' (minus sign) to selectively incorporate entries from another naming service source, such as NIS or LDAP.
.sp
.LP
A line beginning with a '+' means to incorporate entries from the naming service source. There are three styles of the '+' entries in this file. A single + means to insert all the entries from the alternate naming service source at that point, while a +\fIname\fR means to insert the specific entry, if one exists, from the naming service source. A +@\fInetgroup\fR means to insert the entries for all members of the network group \fInetgroup\fR from the alternate naming service. If a +\fIname\fR entry has a non-null \fBpassword\fR, \fIgcos\fR, \fIhome-dir\fR, or \fIlogin-shell\fR field, the value of that field overrides what is contained in the alternate naming service. The \fIuid\fR and \fIgid\fR fields cannot be overridden.
.sp
.LP
A line beginning with a `\(mi' means to disallow entries from the alternate naming service. There are two styles of `-` entries in this file. -\fIname\fR means to disallow any subsequent entries (if any) for \fIname\fR (in this file or in a naming service), and -@\fInetgroup\fR means to disallow any subsequent entries for all members of the network group \fInetgroup\fR.
.sp
.LP
This is also supported by specifying ``passwd : compat'' in \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4). The "compat" source might not be supported in future releases. The preferred sources are \fBfiles\fR followed by the identifier of a name service, such as \fBnis\fR or \fBldap\fR. This has the effect of incorporating the entire contents of the naming service's \fBpasswd\fR database or password-related information after the \fBpasswd\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Note that in compat mode, for every \fB/etc/passwd\fR entry, there must be a corresponding entry in the \fB/etc/shadow\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Appropriate precautions must be taken to lock the \fB/etc/passwd\fR file against simultaneous changes if it is to be edited with a text editor; \fBvipw\fR(1B) does the necessary locking.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSample \fBpasswd\fR File
.sp
.LP
The following is a sample \fBpasswd\fR file:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/sbin/sh
fred:6k/7KCFRPNVXg:508:10:& Fredericks:/usr2/fred:/bin/csh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and the sample password entry from \fBnsswitch.conf\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
passwd: files ldap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this example, there are specific entries for users \fBroot\fR and \fBfred\fR to assure that they can login even when the system is running single-user. In addition, anyone whose password information is stored on an LDAP server will be able to login with their usual password, shell, and home directory.

.sp
.LP
If the password file is:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/sbin/sh
fred:6k/7KCFRPNVXg:508:10:& Fredericks:/usr2/fred:/bin/csh
+
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and the password entry in \fBnsswitch.conf\fR is:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
passwd: compat
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
then all the entries listed in the \fBNIS\fR \fBpasswd.byuid\fR and \fBpasswd.byname\fR maps will be effectively incorporated after the entries for \fBroot\fR and \fBfred\fR. If the password entry in \fBnsswitch.conf\fR is:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
passwd_compat: ldap
passwd: compat
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
then all password-related entries stored on the LDAP server will be incorporated after the entries for \fBroot\fR and \fBfred\fR.

.sp
.LP
The following is a sample \fBpasswd\fR file when \fBshadow\fR does not exist:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
root:q.mJzTnu8icf.:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/sbin/sh
fred:6k/7KCFRPNVXg:508:10:& Fredericks:/usr2/fred:/bin/csh
+john:
+@documentation:no-login:
+::::Guest
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following is a sample \fBpasswd\fR file when \fBshadow\fR does exist:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
root:##root:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/sbin/sh
fred:##fred:508:10:& Fredericks:/usr2/fred:/bin/csh
+john:
+@documentation:no-login:
+::::Guest
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this example, there are specific entries for users \fBroot\fR and \fBfred\fR, to assure that they can log in even when the system is running standalone. The user \fBjohn\fR will have his password entry in the naming service source incorporated without change, anyone in the netgroup \fBdocumentation\fR will have their password field disabled, and anyone else will be able to log in with their usual password, shell, and home directory, but with a \fIgcos\fR field of \fBGuest\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBsolaris.user.manage\fR and \fBsolaris.role.manage\fR authorizations are required to modify the \fBpasswd\fR fields for users and roles respectively. These authorizations allow an administrator to set the \fBusername\fR, \fBuid\fR, \fBgcos-field\fR, \fBhome-dir\fR, and \fBlogin-shell\fR for users and roles respectively. Setting the \fBgid\fR requires the \fBsolaris.group.delegate/assign\fR authorization. See \fBgroup\fR(4).
