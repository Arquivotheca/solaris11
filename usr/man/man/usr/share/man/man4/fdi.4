.SH NAME
fdi \- HAL device information file format 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/fdi.dtd.1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The hardware abstraction layer facility, described in \fBhal\fR(5), uses an \fBXML\fR-based file format to merge arbitrary properties onto device objects. The way device information files works is that once all physical properties are merged onto a device object, it is tried against the set of installed device information files. Device information files are used for both merging facts and policy settings for devices.
.sp
.LP
Each device information file has a number of match directives that are tested against the properties of the device object. The directives have the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<match key="property" [string|int|bool|..]="value">
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If all the match directives pass, then the device information can include the following property directives in the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<[merge|append|prepend] key="property" type="[string|int|bool|..]">
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
These directives are used to merge new properties or append to existing properties on the device object. Any previously property stemming from device detection can be overridden by a device information file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmatch\fR, \fBmerge\fR, \fBappend\fR, and \fBprepend\fR directives require that the key attribute be either a property name on the device object in question or a path to a property on another device object. The path to a property is expressed either through direct specification of the \fBUDI\fR, such as \fB/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer:foo.bar\fR or through indirect references such as "\fB@info.parent:baz\fR", meaning that the device object specified by the \fBUDI\fR in the string property "\fBinfo.parent\fR" should be used to query the property "\fBbaz\fR". It is also possible to use multiple indirections. For example, for a volume on a \fBUSB\fR memory stick, the indirection "\fB@block.storage_device:@storage.physical_device:usb.vendor_id\fR" references the "\fBusb.vendor_id\fR" property on the device object representing the \fBUSB\fR interface. 
.sp
.LP
When the property to match has been determined, the following attributes can be used within the "\fBmatch\fR" tag:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBstring\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Match a string property. For example, <match key= "foo.bar" string="baz"> matches only if "\fBfoo.bar\fR" is a string property assuming the value "\fBbaz\fR".

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBexists\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBempty\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
This attribute can only be used on string properties with "true" and "false". The semantics for "true" is to match only when the string is non-empty. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBis_absolute_path\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Matches only when a string property represents an absolute path (the path does not have to exist). This attribute can be can be used with "true" or "false".
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBis_ascii\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Matches only when a string property contains \fBASCII\fR characters. This attribute can be used with "true" or "false". 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcompare_lt\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
This attribute can be used with \fBint\fR, \fBuint64\fR, \fBdouble\fR and \fBstring\fR properties to compare with a constant. It matches when the given property is less than the given constant using the default ordering.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcompare_le\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Similar to \fBcompare_lt\fR, but matches when the given property is less than or equal than the given constant using the default ordering.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcompare_gt\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
This attribute can only be used with \fBstring\fR and \fBstrlist\fR (string list). For a string key, this matches when the property contains the given (sub)string. For a string list, this matches if the given string matches a item in the list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBcontains_ncase\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Similar to \fBcontains\fR, but the property and the given key are converted to lowercase before it is checked.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBmerge\fR, \fBappend\fR, and \fBprepend\fR directives all require the attribute type which specifies what is to be merged. The following values are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBstring\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The value is copied to the property. For example, <merge key="foo bar" type="string"> baz</merege> merges the value "baz" into the property "foo.bar".
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBstrlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
For \fBmerge\fR, the value is copied to the property and the current property is overwritten. For \fBappend\fR and \fBprepend\fR, the value is appended or prepended to the list as a new item.
.RE

For example, <merge key="foo.bar" type="copy_property">@info.parent:baz.bat</merge> merges the value of the property "baz.bat" on the device object with the \fBUDI\fR from the property "info.parent" into the property "foo.bar" on the device object being processed.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBremove\fR directive requires only a key and can be used with all keys. For \fBstrlist\fR, there is also a special syntax to remove a item from the string list. For example, to remove item "bla" from property "foo.bar", use the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<remove key="foo.bar" type="strlist">bla</merge>
.fi
.in -2
