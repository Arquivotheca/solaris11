.SH NAME
mech, qop \- mechanism and QOP files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/gss/mech\fR
\fB/etc/gss/qop\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR and \fB/etc/gss/qop\fR files contain tables showing installed security mechanisms and the Quality of Protection (\fBQOP\fR) associated with them, respectively. As security mechanisms are installed on the system, entries are added to these two files. Contents of these files may be accessed either manually or programmatically. For example, manually with \fBcat\fR(1) or \fBmore\fR(1), or programmatically with either \fBrpc_gss_get_mechanisms\fR(3NSL) or \fBrpc_gss_get_mech_info\fR(3NSL).
.sp
.LP
The order of entries in the \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR file is significant: the order should be from the most preferred to the least preferred mechanisms.
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR file contains five fields:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImechanism name\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fBASCII\fR string representing the mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIobject identifier\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fBRPC\fR \fBOID\fR for this mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIshared library\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Shared library which implements the services provided by this mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIkernel module\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Kernel module which implements the services provided by this mechanism.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIlibrary options\fR (optional field)\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Optional parameters that are interpreted by the individual mechanism with which they are associated. Specific supported options are described in the documentation for the individual mechanism, if any. Not all mechanisms have support for optional parameters. \fIlibrary options\fR must be enclosed in brackets (\fB[ ]\fR) so they may be differentiated from the optional kernel module entries.

The \fB/etc/gss/qop\fR file contains three fields:
.sp
.ne 2

.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Name, in \fBASCII\fR, of this Quality of Protection.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIQOP value\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Numeric value by which \fBRPC\fR identifies this \fBQOP\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImechanism name\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
\fBASCII\fR string representing the mechanism with which this \fBQOP\fR is associated.
