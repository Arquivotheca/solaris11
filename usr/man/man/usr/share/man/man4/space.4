.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBspace\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file that gives information about disk space requirements for the target environment. The \fBspace\fR file defines space needed beyond what is used by objects defined in the \fBprototype\fR(4) file; for example, files which will be installed with the \fBinstallf\fR(1M) command. The \fBspace\fR file should define the maximum amount of additional space that a package will require.
