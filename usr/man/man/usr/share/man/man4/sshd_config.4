sshd_config \- sshd configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/ssh/sshd_config\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsshd\fR(1M) daemon reads configuration data from \fB/etc/ssh/sshd_config\fR (or the file specified with \fBsshd\fR \fB-f\fR on the command line). The file contains keyword-value pairs, one per line. A line starting with a hash mark (\fB#\fR) and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsshd_config\fR file supports the following keywords. Unless otherwise noted, keywords and their arguments are case-insensitive.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAllowGroups\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This keyword can be followed by a number of group names, separated by spaces. If specified, login is allowed only for users whose primary group or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns. Asterisk (\fB*\fR) and question mark (\fB?\fR) can be used as wildcards in the patterns. Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized. By default, login is allowed regardless of the primary group.

\fB\fBAllowTcpForwarding\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted. The default is \fByes\fR. Disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own forwarders.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAllowUsers\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This keyword can be followed by a number of user names, separated by spaces. If specified, login is allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns. Asterisk (\fB*\fR) and question mark (\fB?\fR) can be used as wildcards in the patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized. By default login is allowed regardless of the user name.
.sp
If a specified pattern takes the form \fIuser\fR@\fIhost\fR then \fIuser\fR and \fIhost\fR are checked separately, restricting logins to particular users from particular hosts.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBAuthorizedKeysFile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the file that contains the public keys that can be used for user authentication. \fBAuthorizedKeysFile\fR can contain tokens of the form \fB%T\fR, which are substituted during connection set-up. The following tokens are defined: \fB%%\fR is replaced by a literal \fB%\fR, \fB%h\fR is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated and \fB%u\fR is replaced by the username of that user. After expansion, \fBAuthorizedKeysFile\fR is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory. The default is \fB\&.ssh/authorized_keys\fR.

\fB\fBBanner\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In some jurisdictions, sending a warning message before authentication can be relevant for getting legal protection. The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before authentication is allowed. This option is only available for protocol version 2. By default, no banner is displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBChrootDirectory\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a path to \fBchroot\fR(2) to after authentication. This path, and all its components, must be root-owned directories that are not writable by any other user or group. 
.sp
The server always tries to change to the user's home directory locally under the chrooted environment but a failure to do so is not considered an error. In addition, the path might contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime once the connecting user has been authenticated: \fB%%\fR is replaced by a literal \fB%\fR, \fB%h\fR is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated, and \fB%u\fR is replaced by the username of that user. 
.sp
The \fBChrootDirectory\fR must contain the necessary files and directories to support the user's session. For an interactive SSH session this requires at least a user's shell, shared libraries needed by the shell, dynamic linker, and possibly basic \fB/dev\fR nodes such as \fBnull\fR, \fBzero\fR, \fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, \fBstderr\fR, \fBrandom\fR, and \fBtty\fR. Additionally, terminal databases are needed for screen oriented applications. For file transfer sessions using \fBsftp\fR with the SSH protocol version 2, no additional configuration of the environment is necessary if the in-process \fBsftp\fR server is used. See \fBSubsystem\fR for details.
.sp
The default is not to \fBchroot\fR(2).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBCiphers\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2. Cipher ordering on the server side is not relevant. Multiple ciphers must be comma separated. 
.sp
Valid ciphers are: \fBaes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256, 3des-cbc\fR, and \fBblowfish-cbc\fR. 
.sp
The default cipher list is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour128,
arcfour256,arcfour
.fi

\fB\fBClientAliveCountMax\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the number of client alive messages, (see \fBClientAliveInterval\fR), that can be sent without \fBsshd\fR receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, \fBsshd\fR disconnects the client, terminating the session. The use of client alive messages is very different from \fBKeepAlive\fR. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore are not spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by \fBKeepAlive\fR is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when a client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
.sp
The default value is 3. If \fBClientAliveInterval\fR is set to 15, and \fBClientAliveCountMax\fR is left at the default, unresponsive \fBssh\fR clients are disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
.RE

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which, if no data has been received from the client, \fBsshd\fR sends a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages are not sent to the client. This option applies only to protocol version 2.

Asterisk (\fB*\fR) and question mark (\fB?\fR) can be used as wildcards in the patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized. By default, login is allowed regardless of the user name. 
.sp
If a specified pattern takes the form \fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fIhost\fR then \fIuser\fR and \fIhost\fR are checked separately, disallowing logins to particular users from particular hosts.

\fB\fBForceCommand\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Forces the execution of the command specified by \fBForceCommand\fR, ignoring any command supplied by the client, and, if present, \fB~/.ssh/rc\fR. The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the \fB-c\fR option. This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution. It is most useful inside a Match block. The command originally supplied by the client is available in the \fBSSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\fR environment variable. Specifying a command of \fBinternal-sftp\fR forces the use of an in-process \fBsftp\fR server that requires no support files when used with \fBChrootDirectory\fR.

\fB\fBGatewayPorts\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports forwarded for the client. By default, \fBsshd\fR binds remote port forwardings to the loopback address. This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports. \fBGatewayPorts\fR can be used to specify that \fBsshd\fR should bind remote port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports. 
.sp
The argument can be \fBno\fR to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local host only, \fByes\fR to force remote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard address, or \fBclientspecified\fR to allow the client to select the address to which the forwarding is bound. The default is \fBno\fR. See also \fBRemoteForward\fR in \fBssh_config\fR(4).

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables/disables GSS-API-authenticated key exchanges. The default is \fByes\fR.
.sp
This option also enables the use of the GSS-API to authenticate the user to server after the key exchange. GSS-API key exchange can succeed but the subsequent authentication using the GSS-API fail if the server does not authorize the user's GSS principal name to the target user account.
.sp
Currently \fBsshd\fR authorizes client user principals to user accounts as follows: if the principal name matches the requested user account, then the principal is authorized. Otherwise, GSS-API authentication fails.

\fB\fBGSSAPIStoreDelegatedCredentials\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables/disables the use of delegated GSS-API credentials on the server-side. The default is \fByes\fR.
.sp
Specifically, this option, when enabled, causes the server to store delegated GSS-API credentials in the user's default GSS-API credential store (which for the Kerberos V mechanism means \fB/tmp/krb5cc_\fI<uid>\fR\fR).
.sp
\fBsshd\fR does not take any steps to explicitly destroy stored delegated GSS-API credentials upon logout. It is the responsibility of PAM modules to destroy credentials associated with a session.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether to try \fBrhosts\fR-based authentication with public key authentication. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fBno\fR. This option applies to protocol version 2 only and is similar to \fBRhostsRSAAuthentication\fR. See \fBsshd\fR(1M) for guidelines on setting up host-based authentication.

Controls which hostname is searched for in the files \fB~/.shosts\fR, \fB/etc/shosts.equiv\fR, and \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR. If this parameter is set to \fByes\fR, the server uses the name the client claimed for itself and signed with that host's key. If set to \fBno\fR, the default, the server uses the name to which the client's IP address resolves.
.sp
Setting this parameter to \fBno\fR disables host-based authentication when using NAT or when the client gets to the server indirectly through a port-forwarding firewall.

\fB\fBKeepAlive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether the system should send \fBkeepalive\fR messages to the other side. If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of the machines is properly noticed. However, this means that connections die if the route is down temporarily, which can be an annoyance. On the other hand, if \fBkeepalives\fR are not sent, sessions can hang indefinitely on the server, leaving ghost users and consuming server resources.
.sp
The default is \fByes\fR (to send \fBkeepalives\fR), and the server notices if the network goes down or the client host reboots. This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.
.sp
To disable \fBkeepalives\fR, the value should be set to \fBno\fR in both the server and the client configuration files.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the \fBconfig\fR file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. Match blocks must be located at the end of the file, after all the global settings.
.sp
The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs. The available criteria are \fBUser\fR, \fBGroup\fR, \fBHost\fR, and \fBAddress\fR. The match patterns can consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and can use the wildcard (Asterisk \fB*\fR and question mark \fB?\fR) and negation (\fB!\fR) operators. 
.sp
The patterns in a Host criteria should be hostname. The patterns in an Address criteria should be an IP address, which can additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, for example, \fB192.0.2.0/24\fR or \fB2001:DB8::/32\fR. The mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, \fB192.0.2.0/33\fR and \fB192.0.2.0/8\fR respectively.
.sp
Only a subset of keywords can be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are \fBAllowTcpForwarding, AuthorizedKeysFile, Banner, ChrootDirectory, ForceCommand, GatewayPorts, GSSAPIAuthentication, HostbasedAuthentication, HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly,KbdInteractiveAuthentication, MaxAuthTries, PasswordAuthentication, PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitRootLogin, PubkeyAuthentication, RhostsRSAAuthentication, RSAAuthentication, X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding\fR, and \fBX11UseLocalhost\fR.

Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon-separated values \fB\fIstart\fR:\fIrate\fR:\fIfull\fR\fR (for example, \fB10:30:60\fR). Referring to this example, \fBsshd\fR refuse connection attempts with a probability of \fIrate\fR/100 (30% in our example) if there are currently 10 (from the \fIstart\fR field) unauthenticated connections.

Specifies whether the root can log in using \fBssh\fR(1). The argument must be \fByes\fR, \fBwithout-password\fR, \fBforced-commands-only\fR, or \fBno\fR. \fBwithout-password\fR means that root cannot be authenticated using the "password" or "keyboard-interactive" methods (see description of \fBKbdInteractiveAuthentication\fR). \fBforced-commands-only\fR means that authentication is allowed only for \fBpublickey\fR (for SSHv2, or RSA, for SSHv1) and only if the matching \fBauthorized_keys entry\fR for root has a \fBcommand=\fR\fI<cmd>\fR option.
.sp
In Solaris, the default \fB/etc/ssh/sshd_config\fR file is shipped with \fBPermitRootLogin\fR set to \fBno\fR. If unset by the administrator, then \fBCONSOLE\fR parameter from \fB/etc/default/login\fR supplies the default value as follows: if the \fBCONSOLE\fR parameter is not commented out (it can even be empty, that is, "\fBCONSOLE=\fR"), then \fBwithout-password\fR is used as default value. If \fBCONSOLE\fR is commented out, then the default for \fBPermitRootLogin\fR is \fByes\fR.

The executable is run before any user validation is conducted by \fBSSHD\fR so the user is not required to be existent before she tries to log in.
.sp
The executable is invoked with two arguments in the following order: the name of the current authentication method and the username. The environment variable \fBSSH_CONNECTION\fR is also passed to the executable. If the executable returns a zero exit status, the current authentication method is processed as normal. See \fBsshd\fR(1M).
.sp
If the exit status is \fB1\fR, the current authentication method is ignored and can not be used to validate the user. The executable must be owned by root and have permissions of \fB0500\fR, otherwise it is treated as if it has exited with status \fB1\fR.
.sp
There is no default value for this property.

\fB\fBSubsystem\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Configures an external subsystem (for example, a file transfer daemon). Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command to execute upon subsystem request. The command \fBsftp-server\fR(1M) implements the \fBsftp\fR file transfer subsystem. 
.sp
Alternately, the name \fBinternal-sftp\fR implements an in-process \fBsftp\fR server. This can simplify configurations using \fBChrootDirectory\fR to force a different filesystem root on clients.
.sp
To specify an option to the internal \fBsftp\fR server, simply add the \fBsftp-server\fR option to the end of line. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#sftp subsystem
Subsystem    sftp    internal-sftp -u 002
.fi
.in -2

By default, no subsystems are defined. This option applies to protocol version 2 only.

Currently only one level certificate chains are supported. This means that certificates must be signed by a private key that corresponds to a certificate located in the directory set by this option. Host key certificates can be self-signed as well. See the \fBUsing X.509 Certificates\fR section in the \fBsshd\fR(1M) man page.

\fB\fBX11Forwarding\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted. The default is \fByes\fR. Disabling X11 forwarding does not improve security in any way, as users can always install their own forwarders.
.sp
When X11 forwarding is enabled, there can be additional exposure to the server and to client displays if the \fBsshd\fR proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see \fBX11UseLocalhost\fR). However, this is not the default. Additionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication data verification and substitution occur on the client side. The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server can be exposed to attack when the \fBssh\fR client requests forwarding (see the warnings for \fBForwardX11\fR in \fBssh_config\fR(4)). A system administrator who wants to protect clients that expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, should specify a \fBno\fR setting.
.sp
Disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can always install their own forwarders.

\fB\fBX11UseLocalhost\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether \fBsshd\fR should bind the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or to the wildcard address. By default, \fBsshd\fR binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the \fBDISPLAY\fR environment variable to \fBlocalhost\fR. This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display. However, some older X11 clients might not function with this configuration. \fBX11UseLocalhost\fR can be set to \fBno\fR to specify that the forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard address. The argument must be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default is \fByes\fR.

OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free \fBssh\fR 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added recent features, and created OpenSSH. Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0. Niels Provos and Markus Friedl contributed support for privilege separation.
