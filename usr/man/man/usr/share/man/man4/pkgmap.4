.SH NAME
pkgmap \- package contents description file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgmap\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file that provides a complete listing of the package contents. It is automatically generated by \fBpkgmk\fR(1) using the information in the \fBprototype\fR(4) file.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in \fBpkgmap\fR describes a single ``deliverable object file.'' A deliverable object file includes shell scripts, executable objects, data files, directories, and so forth. The entry consists of several fields of information, each field separated by a space. The fields are described below and must appear in the order shown.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpart\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
An optional field designating the part number in which the object resides. A part is a collection of files and is the atomic unit by which a package is processed. A developer can choose the criteria for grouping files into a part (for example, based on class). If no value is defined in this field, part 1 is assumed.

Files of the following types can be modified:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBe\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
An editable file, intended to be edited (selectively modified) after installation. An editable file is expected to change on installation or removal, can be shared by several packages, and must be installed by a class action script. Examples are a configuration file or a list of users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBv\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
A volatile file, intended to be overwritten or appended to after installation. A volatile file is not expected to change on installation or removal, is not preserved between installations, and can be installed by a class action script. Examples are a log file or a lock file.
.RE

Following package installation, the contents of files of all types except \fBe\fR and \fBv\fR must not change. Any file that is subject to change should be marked as \fBe\fR or \fBv\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The installation class to which the file belongs. This name must contain only alphanumeric characters and be no longer than 12 characters. It is not specified if the \fIftype\fR is \fBi\fR (information file).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpathname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
\fIpathname\fR may contain variables of the form \fB$\fR\fIvariable\fR that support install-time configuration of the file. \fIvariable\fR may be embedded in the pathname structure. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for definitions of variable specifications.)
.sp
Do not use the following reserved words in \fIpathname\fR, since they are applied by \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) using a different mechanism:

\fB\fImajor\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIminor\fR\fR

The minor device number. The field is only specified for block or character special devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The octal mode of the file (for example, 0664). A question mark (\fB?\fR) indicates that the mode will be left unchanged, implying that the file already exists on the target machine. This field is not used for linked files, packaging information files, or non-installable files.
.sp
The mode can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for definitions of variable specifications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIowner\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The owner of the file (for example, \fBbin\fR or \fBroot\fR). The field is limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR) indicates that the owner will be left unchanged or changed to the owner stored in the package database, which could be different from what is on the file system. When the question mark is used, it implies that the file is already on the file system. This field is not used for linked files or non-installable files. It is used optionally with a package information file. If used, it indicates with what owner an installation script will be executed.
.sp
The owner can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for definitions of variable specifications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The group to which the file belongs (for example, \fBbin\fR or \fBsys\fR). The field is limited to 14 characters in length. A question mark (\fB?\fR) indicates that the group will be left unchanged or changed to the owner stored in the package database, which could be different from what is on the file system. When the question mark is used, it implies that the file is already on the file system. This field is not used for linked files or non-installable files. It is used optionally with a package information file. If used, it indicates with what group an installation script will be executed.
.sp
The group can contain a variable specification. (See \fBprototype\fR(4) for definitions of variable specifications.)

.sp

\fB\fIsize\fR\fR

.RS 12n

The actual size of the file in bytes. This field is not specified for named pipes, special devices, directories or linked files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcksum\fR\fR

.RS 12n

The checksum of the file contents. This field is not specified for named pipes, special devices, directories, or linked files.

\fB\fImodtime\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n

The time of last modification, as reported by the \fBstat\fR(2) function call. This field is not specified for named pipes, special devices, directories, or linked files.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Each \fBpkgmap\fR file must have one line that provides information about the number of parts, maximum size of parts that make up the package, and, optionally, the size of the package after compression (where size is given in 512-byte blocks). This line is in the following format:
.sp
.LP
\fB:\fR \fInumber_of_parts\fR \fImaximum_part_size\fR \fIcompressed_pkg_size\fR
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with ``\fB#\fR'' are comment lines and are ignored.
.sp
.LP
When files are saved during installation before they are overwritten, they are normally just copied to a temporary pathname. However, for files whose mode includes execute permission (but which are not editable), the existing version is linked to a temporary pathname and the original file is removed. This allows processes which are executing during installation to be overwritten.
