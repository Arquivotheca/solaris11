.SH NAME
pkginfo \- package characteristics file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkginfo\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file that describes the characteristics of the package along with information that helps control the flow of installation. It is created by the software package developer.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBpkginfo\fR file is a line that establishes the value of a parameter in the following form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
PARAM="\fIvalue\fR"
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
There is no required order in which the parameters must be specified within the file. The \fBPKG\fR, \fBNAME\fR, \fBARCH\fR, \fBVERSION\fR and \fBCATEGORY\fR parameters are mandatory. Other parameters are optional.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkginfo\fR provides optional parameters and an environment variable in support of the zones (multiple Solaris environments) feature. See \fBzones\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The following parameters are mandatory:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBARCH\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A comma-separated list of alphanumeric tokens that indicate the architecture associated with the package. The \fBpkgmk\fR(1) tool can be used to create or modify this value when actually building the package. The maximum length of a token is 16 characters and it cannot include a comma.
.sp
Solaris's installation software meaningfully uses only one architecture token of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIinstruction_set_architecture\fR>[.<\fIplatform_group\fR>]
.fi
.in -2

where \fIplatform_group\fR is intended only for Solaris installation packages. Third party application software should restrict itself to \fBARCH\fR values from the following Solaris-supported instruction set architectures (\fBuname -p\fR): \fBsparc\fR, \fBi386\fR, and \fBppc\fR. Examples of Solaris' platform groups (\fBuname -m\fR) are \fBsun4u\fR for the \fBSPARC\fR instruction set and \fBi86pc\fR for the i386 instruction set. See \fBuname\fR(1) and \fBisalist\fR(1) for more details.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBCATEGORY\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A comma-separated list of categories under which a package can be displayed. A package must at least belong to the system or application category. Categories are case-insensitive and can contain only alphanumerics. Each category is limited in length to 16 characters.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNAME\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Text that specifies the package name (maximum length of 256 \fBASCII\fR characters). Use the \fBNAME\fR parameter as the foundation for describing the functionality and purpose of the package; spell out any acronyms and avoid internal product/project code names. The \fBDESC\fR parameter can then be used to expand the descriptive information. Use the \fBNAME\fR parameter to state as specifically as possible the use of the package, why a user would need to load it, and so on.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPKG\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Abbreviation for the package being installed. All characters in the abbreviation must be alphanumeric. You can also use the \fB\(mi\fR and \fB+\fR characters in the abbreviation. The first character cannot be numeric, a \fB+\fR or a \fB-\fR.
.sp
The abbreviation is limited to a maximum length of 32 characters. \fBinstall\fR, \fBnew\fR, and \fBall\fR are reserved abbreviations. It is customary to make the first four letters unique to your company, such as the company's stock symbol.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBVERSION\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Text that specifies the current version associated with the software package. The maximum length is 256 \fBASCII\fR characters and the first character cannot be a left parenthesis. The \fBpkgmk\fR(1) tool can be used to create or modify this value when actually building the package. Current Solaris software practice is to assign this parameter monotonically increasing Dewey decimal values of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fImajor_revision\fR>.<\fIminor_revision\fR>[.<\fImicro_revision\fR>]
.fi
.in -2

where all the revision fields are integers. The versioning fields can be extended to an arbitrary string of numbers in Dewey-decimal format, if necessary.
.RE

The following parameters are optional:
.sp

\fB\fBBASEDIR\fR\fR

\fB\fBCLASSES\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A space-separated list of classes defined for a package. The order of the list determines the order in which the classes are installed. Classes listed first are installed first (on a media by media basis). This parameter can be modified by the request script.

\fB\fBDESC\fR\fR

The maximum number of package instances that should be allowed on a machine at the same time. By default, only one instance of a package is allowed. This parameter must be set in order to have multiple instances of a package. In order to support multiple instances of packages (for example, packages that differ in their \fBARCH\fR or \fBVERSION\fR parameter value), the value of this parameter must be high enough to allow for all instances of a given package, including multiple versions coexisting on a software server.

Packages that must be identical across all zones must set this variable to \fBtrue\fR.

Packages that deliver components that are not part of the core operating system (such as application programs) that can be different between any two zones must set this variable to \fBfalse\fR.

Use of \fBpkgadd\fR in the global zone installs packages in all zones unless \fB-G\fR is specified, in which case packages are installed in the global zone only.
