\fB/etc/remote\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The systems known by \fBtip\fR(1) and their attributes are stored in an \fBASCII\fR file which is structured somewhat like the \fBtermcap\fR file. Each line in the file provides a description for a single \fIsystem\fR. Fields are separated by a colon `\fB:\fR'. Lines ending in a `\fB\e\fR\&' character with an immediately following \fBNEWLINE\fR are continued on the next line.
.sp
.LP
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system. If there is more than one name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars. After the name of the system comes the fields of the description.  A field name followed by an `\fB=\fR' sign indicates a string value follows. A field name followed by a `\fB#\fR' sign indicates a following numeric value.
.sp
.LP
Entries named \fBtip\fR\fIbaudrate\fR are used as default entries by \fBtip\fR, as follows.  When \fBtip\fR is invoked with only a phone number, it looks for an entry of the form \fBtip\fR\fIbaudrate\fR, where \fIbaudrate\fR is the baud rate with which the connection is to be made.  For example, if the connection is to be made at  \fB300\fR baud, \fBtip\fR looks for an entry of the form \fBtip300\fR.
.SH CAPABILITIES
.sp
.LP
Capabilities are either strings \fB(str)\fR, numbers \fB(num)\fR, or boolean flags \fB(bool)\fR. A string capability is specified by \fIcapability\fR=\fIvalue\fR; for example, `\fBdv=/dev/harris\fR'. A numeric capability is specified by \fIcapability\fR#\fIvalue\fR; for example, `\fBxa#99\fR'. A boolean capability is specified by simply listing the capability.

.sp
For Hayes-compatible modems, if the telephone number starts with an 'S', the telephone number string will be sent to the modem without the "\fBDT\fR", which allows reconfiguration of the modem's S-registers and other parameters; for example, to disable auto-answer:  "\fBpn=S0=0DT5551234\fR";  or to also restrict the modem to return only the basic result codes:  "\fBpn=S0=0X0DT5551234\fR".
