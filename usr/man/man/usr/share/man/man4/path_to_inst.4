.SH NAME
path_to_inst \- device instance number file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/path_to_inst\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/path_to_inst\fR records mappings of physical device names to instance numbers.
.sp
.LP
The instance number of a device is encoded in its minor number, and is the way that a device driver determines which of the possible devices that it may drive is referred to by a given special file.
.sp
.LP
In order to keep instance numbers persistent across reboots, the system records them in \fB/etc/path_to_inst\fR.
.sp
.LP
This file is read only at boot time, and is updated by \fBadd_drv\fR(1M) and \fBdevfsadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Note that it is generally not necessary for the system administrator to change this file, as the system will maintain it.
.sp
.LP
The system administrator can change the assignment of instance numbers by editing this file and doing a reconfiguration reboot. However, any changes made in this file will be lost if \fBadd_drv\fR(1M) or \fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) is run before the system is rebooted.

Each instance entry is a single line of the form:

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
If the file is removed the system may not be bootable (as it may rely on information found in this file to find the root, usr or swap device). If it does successfully boot, it will regenerate the file, but after rebooting devices may end up having different minor numbers than they did before, and special files created via \fBmknod\fR(1M) may refer to different devices than expected.
.sp
.LP
For the same reasons, changes should not be made to this file without careful consideration.

This document does not constitute an API. \fBpath_to_inst\fR may not exist or may have a different content or interpretation in a future release. The existence of this notice does not imply that any other documentation that lacks this notice constitutes an API.
