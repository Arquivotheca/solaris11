.SH NAME
ftp \- FTP client configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/default/ftp\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBftp\fR file to configure the behavior of the FTP client. Lines that begin with a hash symbol ("# ") are treated as comment  lines and are ignored.
.SS "Behavior Directives"
.sp
.LP
The \fBftp\fR file supports the following behavior directives:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST=yes | no\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt  
The \fBls\fR command of the ftp client sends an \fBNLST\fR to the FTP Server by default. Several non-Solaris clients send \fBLIST\fR instead. In order to make the Solaris \fBftp\fR client send \fBLIST\fR when the \fBls\fR command is issued, set \fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR to \fBno\fR. The value of \fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR is \fByes\fR by default.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If the user sets a value for \fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR in the user's environment, this value will override any \fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR directive that is specified in \fB/etc/default/ftp\fR.
