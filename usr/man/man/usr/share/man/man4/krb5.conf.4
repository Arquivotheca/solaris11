.SH NAME
krb5.conf \- Kerberos configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/etc/krb5/krb5.conf
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkrb5.conf\fR file contains Kerberos configuration information, including the locations of \fBKDC\fRs and administration daemons for the Kerberos realms of interest, defaults for the current realm and for Kerberos applications, and mappings of host names onto Kerberos realms. This file must reside on all Kerberos clients.
.sp
.LP
The format of the \fBkrb5.conf\fR consists of sections headings in square brackets. Each section can contain zero or more configuration variables (called \fIrelations\fR), of the form:
.sp
.LP
\fIrelation\fR= \fIrelation-value\fR 
.sp
.LP
or
.sp
.LP
\fIrelation-subsection\fR = {

.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fIrelation\fR= \fIrelation-value\fR 
.in -2
.sp
.LP
}

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates whether DNS SRV records need to be used to locate the KDCs and the other servers for a realm, if they have not already been listed in the \fB[realms]\fR section. This option makes the machine vulnerable to a certain type of DoS attack if someone spoofs the DNS records and does a redirect to another server. This is, however, no worse than a DoS, since the bogus KDC is unable to decode anything sent (excepting the initial ticket request, which has no encrypted data). Also, anything the fake KDC sends out isl not trusted without verification (the local machine is unaware of the secret key to be used). If \fBdns_lookup_kdc\fR is not specified but \fBdns_fallback\fR is, then that value is used instead. In either case, values (if present) in the \fB[realms]\fR section override DNS. \fBdns_lookup_kdc\fR is enabled by default.

Indicates whether DNS TXT records need to be used to determine the Kerberos realm information and/or the host/domain name-to-realm mapping of a host, if this information is not already present in the \fBkrb5.conf\fR file. Enabling this option might make the host vulnerable to a redirection attack, wherein spoofed DNS replies persuade a client to authenticate to the wrong realm. In a realm with no cross-realm trusts, this a DoS attack. If \fBdns_lookup_realm\fR is not specified but \fBdns_fallback\fR is, then that value is used instead. In either case, values (if present) in the \fB[libdefaults]\fR and \fB[domain_realm]\fR sections override DNS.

If undefined, the behavior is as if this option were set to \fBtrue\fR. Setting this value to \fBfalse\fR leaves the system vulnerable to \fBDNS\fR spoofing attacks.

A relation subsection that enables \fBkadmin\fR (\fBadmin_server_rotate\fR) and/or \fBkdc\fR (\fBkdc_rotate\fR) logging to be rotated to multiple files based on a time interval. This can be used to avoid logging to one file, which might grow too large and bring the \fBKDC\fR to a halt.
.RE

The time interval for the rotation is specified by the \fBperiod\fR relation. The number of log files to be rotated is specified by the \fBversions\fR relation. Both the \fBperiod\fR and \fBversions\fR (described below) should be included in this subsection. And, this subsection applies only if the \fBkdc\fR relation has a \fBFILE:\fR value.

.sp

\fB\fB\fR\fBperiod=\fIdelta_time\fR\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.LP
Specifying a time interval does not mean that the log files are rotated at the time interval based on real time. This is because the time interval is checked at each attempt to write a record to the log, or when logging is actually occurring. Therefore, rotation occurs only when logging has actually occurred for the specified time interval.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBversions=\fR\fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies how many previous versions are saved before the rotation begins. A number is appended to the log file, starting with 0 and ending with (\fInumber\fR - 1). For example, if \fBversions\fR is set to \fB2\fR, up to three logging files are created (\fIfilename\fR, \fIfilename\fR.0, and \fIfilename\fR.1) before the first one is overwritten to begin the rotation.
.RE

Notice that if \fBversions\fR is not specified or set to \fB0\fR, only one log file is created, but it is overwritten whenever the time interval is met.

In order to perform direct (non-hierarchical) cross-realm authentication, a database is needed to construct the authentication paths between the realms. This section defines that database.
.sp
.LP
A client uses this section to find the authentication path between its realm and the realm of the server. The server uses this section to verify the authentication path used by the client, by checking the transited field of the received ticket.
.sp
.LP
There is a subsection for each participating realm, and each subsection has relations named for each of the realms. The \fIrelation-value\fR is an intermediate realm which can participate in the cross-realm authentication. The relations can be repeated if there is more than one intermediate realm. A value of '.' means that the two realms share keys directly, and no intermediate realms should be allowed to participate.
.sp
.LP
There are n**2 possible entries in this table, but only those entries which is needed on the client or the server need to be present. The client needs a subsection named for its local realm, with relations named for all the realms of servers it needs to authenticate with. A server needs a subsection named for each realm of the clients it serves.
.sp
.LP
For example, \fBANL.GOV\fR, \fBPNL.GOV\fR, and \fBNERSC.GOV\fR all wish to use the \fBES.NET\fR realm as an intermediate realm. \fBANL\fR has a sub realm of \fBTEST.ANL.GOV\fR, which authenticates with \fBNERSC.GOV\fR but not \fBPNL.GOV\fR.

In the above examples, the ordering is not important, except when the same relation is used more than once. The client uses this to determine the path. (It is not important to the server, since the transited field is not sorted.)

If the \fBkrb5.conf\fR file is not formatted properly, the \fBtelnet\fR command fails. However, the \fBdtlogin\fR and \fBlogin\fR commands still succeed, even if the \fBkrb5.conf\fR file is specified as required for the commands. If this occurs, the following error message is displayed:

To bypass any other problems that might occur, you should fix the file as soon as possible.
