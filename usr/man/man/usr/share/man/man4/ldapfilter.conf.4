.SH NAME
ldapfilter.conf \- configuration file for LDAP filtering routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWconn/ldap/current/ldapfilter.conf\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldapfilter.conf\fR file contains information used by the LDAP filtering routines. 
.sp
.LP
Blank lines and lines that begin with a hash character (\fB#\fR) are treated as comments and ignored. The configuration information consists of lines that contain one to five tokens. Tokens are separated by white space, and double quotes can be used to include white space inside a token.
.sp
.LP
The file consists of a sequence of one or more filter sets. A filter set begins with a line containing a single token called a \fItag\fR.
.sp
.LP
The filter set consists of a sequence of one or more filter lists. The first line in a filter list must contain four or five tokens: the \fIvalue pattern\fR, the \fIdelimiter list\fR, a \fIfiltertemplate\fR, a \fImatch description\fR, and an optional \fIsearch scope\fR. The \fIvalue pattern\fR is a regular expression that is matched against the value passed to the LDAP library call to select the filter list.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdelimiter list\fR is a list of the characters (in the form of a single string) that can be used to break the \fBvalue\fR into distinct words. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIfilter template\fR is used to construct an LDAP filter (see description below)
.sp
.LP
The \fImatch description\fR is returned to the caller along with a filter as a piece of text that can be used to describe the sort of LDAP search that took place. It should correctly compete both of the following phrases: "One \fImatch description\fR match was found for ..." and "Three \fImatch description\fR matches were found for...."
.sp
.LP
The \fIsearch scope\fR is optional, and should be one of \fBbase\fR, \fBonelevel\fR, or \fBsubtree\fR. If \fIsearch scope\fR is not provided, the default is \fBsubtree\fR.
.sp
.LP
The remaining lines of the filter list should contain two or three tokens, a \fIfilter template,\fR a \fImatch description\fR and an optional \fIsearch scope\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIfilter template\fR is similar in concept to a \fBprintf\fR(3C) style format string. Everything is taken literally except for the character sequences:
