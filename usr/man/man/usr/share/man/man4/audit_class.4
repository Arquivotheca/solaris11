audit_class \- audit class definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_class\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/security/audit_class\fR is an administrator configurable system file that stores class definitions used in the audit system. Audit events in \fBaudit_event\fR(4) are mapped to one or more of the defined audit classes. \fBaudit_event\fR can be updated in conjunction with changes to \fBaudit_class\fR. See \fBauditconfig\fR(1M) and \fBuser_attr\fR(4) for information about changing the preselection of audit classes in the audit system.
.sp
.LP
The fields for each class entry are separated by colons. Each class entry is a bitmap and is separated from each other by a NEWLINE.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBaudit_class\fR file has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fImask\fR:\fIname\fR:\fIdescription\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The fields are defined as follows:

class description
.RE

.sp
.LP
Each class is represented as a bit in the 64 bit class mask. There are 64 different classes available. Meta-classes can also be defined. Meta-classes are supersets composed of multiple base classes, and have more than 1 bit in smask. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Two  special meta-classes are pre-defined: \fBall\fR and \fBno\fR.
.sp
.ne 2

Represents a conjunction of all allowed classes, and is provided as a shorthand method of specifying all classes.

\fB\fBno\fR\fR

.rt  
Is the invalid class, and any event mapped solely to this class are not audited. Turning auditing on to the \fBall\fR meta-class does not cause events mapped solely to the \fBno\fR class to be written to the audit trail. This class is also used to map obsolete events which are no longer generated. Obsolete events are retained to process old audit trails files.
