.SH NAME
ttydefs \- file contains terminal line settings information for ttymon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/ttydefs\fR is an administrative file that contains records divided into fields by colons (":").   This information used by \fBttymon\fR to set up the speed and terminal settings for a TTY port.
.sp
.LP
The \fBttydefs\fR file contains the following fields:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIttylabel\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The string \fBttymon\fR tries to match against the TTY port's \fIttylabel\fR field in the port monitor administrative file. It often describes the speed at which the terminal is supposed to run, for example, \fB1200\fR.

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIinitial-flags\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Contains the initial  \fBtermio\fR(7I) settings to which the terminal is to be set. For example, the system administrator will be able to specify what the default erase and kill characters will be. \fIinitial-flags\fR must be specified in the syntax recognized by the \fBstty\fR command.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfinal-flags\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
\fIfinal-flags\fR must be specified in the same format as \fIinitial-flags\fR. \fBttymon\fR sets these final settings after a connection request has been made and immediately prior to invoking a port's service.

\fB\fIautobaud\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If the autobaud field contains the character 'A,' autobaud will  be enabled. Otherwise, autobaud will be disabled. \fBttymon\fR determines what line speed to set the TTY port to by analyzing the carriage returns entered. If autobaud has been disabled, the hunt sequence is used for baud rate determination.

\fB\fInextlabel\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If the user indicates that the current terminal setting is not appropriate by sending a BREAK, \fBttymon\fR searchs for a \fBttydefs\fR entry whose \fIttylabel\fR field matches  the \fInextlabel\fR field. If a match is found, \fBttymon\fR uses that field as its \fIttylabel\fR field. A series of speeds is often linked together in this way into a closed set called a hunt sequence. For example, \fB4800\fR may be linked to \fB1200\fR, which in turn is linked to \fB2400\fR, which is finally linked to \fB4800\fR.
