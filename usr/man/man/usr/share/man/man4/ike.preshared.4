.SH NAME
ike.preshared \- pre-shared keys file for IKE
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/inet/secret/ike.preshared\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/inet/secret/ike.preshared\fR file contains secret keying material that two \fBIKE\fR instances can use to authenticate each other. Because of the sensitive nature of this data, it is kept in the \fB/etc/inet/secret\fR directory, which is only accessible by root.
.sp
.LP
Pre-shared keys are delimited by open-curly-brace (\fB{\fR) and close-curly-brace (\fB}\fR) characters. There are five name-value pairs required inside a pre-shared key:

.LP
Comment lines with \fB#\fR appearing in the first column are also legal. 
.sp
.LP
An ASCII-string can consist of any valid ASCII character except for NEWLINE.  A backslash (\fB\e\fR) is considered an escape character when it precedes a double quote or itself. Otherwise a backslash is taken literally.
.sp
.LP
Files in this format can also be used by the \fBikeadm\fR(1M) command to load additional pre-shared keys into a running an \fBin.iked\fR(1M) process.

The following is an example of an \fBike.preshared\fR file:

#
# Two pre-shared keys between myself, 10.1.1.2, and two remote
# hosts.  Note that names are not allowed for IP addresses.     
#
# A decent hex string can be obtained by performing:
#           od -x </dev/random | head

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
If this file is compromised, all \fBIPsec\fR security associations derived from secrets in this file will be compromised as well. The default permissions on \fBike.preshared\fR are \fB0600\fR. They should stay this way.
