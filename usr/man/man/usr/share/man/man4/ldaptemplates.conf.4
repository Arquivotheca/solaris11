.SH NAME
ldaptemplates.conf \- configuration file for LDAP display template routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWconn/ldap/current/ldaptemplates.conf\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldaptemplates.conf\fR file contains information used by the LDAP display routines. 
.sp
.LP
Blank lines and lines that start with a hash character ('#') are treated as comments and ignored. Non-comment lines contain one or more tokens. Tokens are separated by white space, and double quotes can be used to include white space inside a token.
.sp
.LP
The first non-commment line specifies the version of the template information and must contain the token \fBVersion\fR followed by an integer version number. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Version 1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The current version is \fI1\fR, so the above example is always the correct first line.
.sp
.LP
The remainder of the file consists of one or more display templates. The first two lines of the display template each contain a single token that specifies singular and plural names for the template in a user-friendly format. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"Person"
"People"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
specifies appropriate names for a template designed to display person information.
.sp
.LP
The next line specifies the name of the icon or similar element that is associated with this template. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"person icon"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The next line is a blank-separated list of template options. "" can be used if no options are desired. Available options are: \fBaddable\fR (it is appropriate to allow entries of this type to be added), \fBmodrdn\fR (it is appropriate to offer the \fBmodify rdn\fR operation), \fBaltview\fR (this template is an alternate view of another template). For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"addable" "modrdn"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The next portion of the template is a list of X.500 object classes that is used to determine whether the template should be used to display a given entry. The object class information consists of one or more lines, followed by a terminating line that contains the single token \fBEND\fR. Each line contains one or more object class names, all of which must be present in a directory entry. Multiple lines can be used to associate more than one set of object classes with a given template. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
emailPerson
orgPerson
END
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
means that the template is appropriate for display of \fBemailPerson\fR entries or \fBorgPerson\fR entries.
.sp
.LP
The next line after the object class list is the name of the attribute to authenticate as to make changes (use "" if it is appropriate to authenticate as the entry itself). For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"owner"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The next line is the default attribute to use when naming a new entry, for example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"cn"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The next line is the distinguished name of the default location under which new entries are created. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"o=XYZ, c=US"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The next section is a list of rules used to assign default values to new entries. The list should be terminated with a line that contains the single token \fBEND\fR. Each line in this section should either begin with the token \fBconstant\fR and be followed by the name of the attribute and a constant value to assign, or the line should begin with \fBaddersdn\fR followed by the name of an attribute whose value will be the DN of the person who has authenticated to add the entry. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
constant	associatedDomain	XYZ.us
addersdn	seeAlso
END
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The last portion of the template is a list of items to display. It consists of one or more lines, followed by a terminating line that contains the single token \fBEND\fR. Each line is must begin with the token \fBsamerow\fR or the token \fBitem\fR 
.sp
.LP
It is assumed that each item appears on a row by itself unless it was preceded by a \fBsamerow\fR line (in which case it should be displayed on the same line as the previous item, if possible). Lines that begin with \fBsamerow\fR should not have any other tokens on them.
.sp
.LP
Lines that begin with \fBitem\fR must have at least three more tokens on them: an item type, a label, and an attribute name. Any extra tokens are taken as extra arguments.
.sp
.LP
The item type token must be one of the following strings:
