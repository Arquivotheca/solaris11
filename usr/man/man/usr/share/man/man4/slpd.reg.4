.SH NAME
slpd.reg \- serialized registration file for the service location protocol daemon (slpd)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/inet/slpd.reg\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The serialized registration file contains a group of registrations that \fBslpd\fR(1M) registers when it starts. These registrations are primarily for older service programs that do not internally support \fBSLP\fR and cannot be converted. The character format of the registration file is required to be \fBASCII\fR. To use serialized registrations, set the \fBnet.slp.serializedRegURL\fR property  in \fBslp.conf\fR(4) to point at a valid \fBslpd.reg\fR file. The syntax of the serialized registration file, in \fBABNF\fR format (see \fIRFC 2234\fR), is as follows:
.sp

ser-file      =  reg-list
reg-list      =  reg / reg reg-list
reg           =  creg / ser-reg

comment-line  =  ( "#" / ";" ) 1*allchar newline
ser-reg       =  url-props [slist] [attr-list] newline
url-props     =  surl "," lang "," ltime [ "," type ] newline
surl          =  ;The registration's URL. See
                 ; [8] for syntax.
lang          =  1*8ALPHA [ "-" 1*8ALPHA ]
                 ;RFC 1766 Language Tag see [6].
ltime         =  1*5DIGIT
                 ; A positive 16-bit integer
                 ; giving the lifetime
                 ; of the registration.
type          =  ; The service type name, see [7]
                 ; and [8] for syntax.
slist         =  "scopes" "=" scope-list newline
scope-list    =  scope-name / scope-name "," scope-list
scope         =  ; See grammar of [7] for 
                 ; scope-name syntax.
attr-list     =  attr-def / attr-def attr-list
attr-def      =  ( attr / keyword ) newline
keyword       =  attr-id
attr          =  attr-id "=" attr-val-list
attr-id       =  ;Attribute id, see [7] for syntax.
attr-val-list =  attr-val / attr-val "," attr-val-list
attr-val      =  ;Attribute value, see [7] for syntax
allchar       =  char / WSP
char          =  DIGIT / ALPHA / other
other         =  %x21-%x2f / %x3a-%x40 /
                 %x5b-%x60 / %7b-%7e

                  ; characters.

.LP
The syntax for attributes and attribute values requires that you use a backslash to escape special characters, in addition to non-\fBASCII\fR characters, as specified in \fIRFC 2608\fR. The \fBslpd\fR command handles serialized registrations exactly as if they were registered by an \fBSA\fR. In the \fBurl-props\fR production, the type token is optional. If the type token is present for a service: \fBURL\fR, a warning is signalled, and the type name is ignored. If the maximum lifetime of \fB65535\fR seconds is specified, the registration is taken to be permanent, and it is continually refreshed by the \fBDA\fR or \fBSA\fR server until it exits.
.sp
.LP
Scopes can be included in a registration by including an attribute definition with tag \fBscopes\fR followed by a comma-separated list of scope names immediately after the \fBurl-props\fR production. If the optional \fBscope-list\fR is present, the registations are made in the indicated scopes; otherwise, they are registered in the scopes with which the \fBDA\fR or \fBSA\fR server was configured through the \fBnet.slp.useScopes\fR property. If any conflicts occur between the scope list and the \fBnet.slp.useScopes\fR property, an error message is issued by way of \fBsyslog\fR(3C). Refer to information regarding \fBLOG_INFO\fR in \fBsyslog\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
Service advertisements are separated by a single blank line. Additionally, the file must end with a single blank line.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing a Serialized Registration File
.sp
.LP
The following serialized registration file shows an instance of the service type  \fBfoo\fR, with a lifetime of \fB65535\fR seconds, in the \fBen\fR locale, with scope \fBsomescope\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# register foo
service:foo://fooserver/foopath,en,65535
scopes=somescope
description=bogus
security=kerberos_v5
location=headquarters

# next registration...
