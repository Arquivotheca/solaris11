.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Reconfiguration and Coordination Manager (RCM) is a framework designed to coordinate device consumers during Solaris Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR). The interfaces specified in this man page allow device consumers, such as application vendors or site administrators, to act before and after DR operations take place by providing RCM scripts. You can write your own RCM scripts to shut down your applications, or to cleanly release the devices from your applications during dynamic remove operations. 
.sp
.LP
An RCM script is an executable perl script, a shell script or a binary. Perl is the recommended language. Each script is run in its own address space using the user-id of the script file owner.
.sp
.LP
An RCM script is invoked on demand in response to DR as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<scriptname>\fR \fI<command>\fR [\fIargs\fR ...]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Every script must implement the following RCM commands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBscriptinfo\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Get script information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBregister\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Register devices the script handles.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBresourceinfo\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Get resource information.
.RE

.sp
.LP
A script might include some or all the of the following commands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBqueryremove\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Queries whether the resource can be released.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBpreremove\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Releases the resource.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBpostremove\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Provides post-resource removal notification.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBundoremove\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Undo the actions done in preremove.
.RE

.sp
.LP
When a script's \fBregister\fR command is run, the script should supply, in return data, all resource names the script or its application handles that could potentially be removed by DR. A resource name refers to a name in \fB/dev\fR path name.
.sp
.LP
Below is a high-level overview of the sequence of script invocations that occurs when dynamic removal of a script's registered resource is attempted. See the COMMANDS section for a detailed description of the commands.
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Prior to removing the resource from the system during DR, the script's \fBqueryremove\fR command is run:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<scriptname>\fR queryremove \fI<resourcename>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The script should check for obvious reasons why the resource can not be removed from the perspective of its service or application.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
If the script indicates that the resource can be removed in the \fBqueryremove\fR command. The script's \fBpreremove\fR command is run:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<scriptname>\fR preremove \fI<resourcename>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The script releases the resource from the service or application represented by the script and prepares for the resource removal. Releasing the resource includes closing the resource if the resource is currently opened by its application.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
The system then proceeds to remove the resource.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
If the system has removed the resource successfully the script's \fBpostremove\fR command is run:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<scriptname>\fR postremove \fI<resourcename>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Otherwise the script's \fBundoremove\fR command is run:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<scriptname>\fR undoremove \fI<resourcename>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE
.sp
.LP
For any commands the script does not implement, it must exit with exit status of 2. RCM silently returns success for the script's unimplemented commands.
.sp
.LP
A script performs the following basic steps:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Takes RCM command and additional arguments from the command line and environment parameters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Processes the command.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Writes the expected return data to stdout as \fIname=value\fR pairs delimited by newlines, where \fIname\fR is the name of the return data item that RCM expects and \fIvalue\fR is the value associated with the data item.

.SS "Commands"
.SS "\fBscriptinfo\fR"

The \fBscriptinfo\fR command is invoked to gather information about the script.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fBReturn data:\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
If successful, the script must write the following name-value pairs to stdout and exit with status 0:
.RS +4

.ie t \(bu

\fBrcm_cmd_timeout=\fR\fIcommand_timeout_value\fR
.RE
where \fIscript_func_info\fR is a localized human-readable message describing the functionality of the script.
.sp
The RCM monitors the execution time of RCM commands by RCM scripts. \fIcommand_timeout_value\fR is the maximum time in seconds the script is expected to take to process any RCM command except the \fBscriptinfo\fR command itself. If an RCM script does not process the RCM command and exit within this time, RCM sends a \fBSIGABRT\fR signal to the script process. RCM then waits for a few seconds for the script to finish the processing of the current RCM command and exit. If the script does not exit within this time, RCM sends a \fBSIGKILL\fR signal to the script.
.sp
The \fBrcm_cmd_timeout\fR name-value pair is optional. It is only needed if the script is expected to take more than a few seconds to process any RCM command. Setting this name to a value of 0 (zero) disables the timer. If this name-value pair is not supplied, a default value is assigned by the RCM.
.sp
Upon failure, the script must specify the failure reason using the name-value pair \fBrcm_failure_reason\fR and exit with status 1.
.RE

.SS "\fBregister\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBregister\fR command is invoked to allow a script to specify the resources that it or its application handles that could potentially be removed by DR. The script has to supply all its resource names to RCM using the name-value pair \fBrcm_resource_name\fR.

.RE

.SS "\fBqueryremove\fR \fIresourcename\fR"
.sp
.LP
Prior to removing the resource from the system, the \fBqueryremove\fR command is invoked to query the script to determine whether the script can release the given resource successfully from the service or application it represents. The script does not actually release the resource. The script might indicate that it is not able to release the resource if the resource is critical for its service or application.

Indicates that the script cannot release the resource for \fBpreremove\fR and \fBqueryremove\fR commands. The script should provide a message to RCM specifying the reason for not being able to release the resource using the name-value pair \fBrcm_failure_reason\fR before exiting.

If a script cannot successfully process an RCM command, it must supply to the RCM a message indicating the reason for failure by writing a name-value pair, in the form shown below, to stdout and exiting with the appropriate exit status.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
RCM scripts are expected to properly handle all RCM commands that the script implements and to log all errors. Only root has permission to add or remove an RCM script. An ill-behaved RCM script can cause unexpected DR failures.
.sp
.LP
RCM commands are invoked only for the resources whose subsystems participate within the RCM framework. Currently, not all susbsystems participate within the RCM framework.
