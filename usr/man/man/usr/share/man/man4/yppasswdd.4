.SH NAME
yppasswdd \- configuration file for rpc.yppasswdd (NIS password daemon)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/default/yppasswdd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fByppasswdd\fR file contains a parameter that modifies the behavior of the \fBrpc.yppasswdd\fR(1M) daemon.
.sp
.LP
The \fByppasswdd\fR file contains a single parameter:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#check_restricted_shell_name=1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
By default in the current release, this line in \fByppasswdd\fR is commented  out. If you uncomment the line, when a user attempts to change his default shell using \fB`passwd -r nis -e`\fR (see \fBpasswd\fR(1)),  the \fBrpc.yppasswdd\fR daemon checks whether the name of the user's current shell begins with an 'r'. \fBrpc.yppasswdd\fR considers any  shell whose name begins with an 'r' (for example, \fBrcsh\fR) to be a restricted shell. If a user's shell does begin with 'r', his attempt to change from the default shell will fail.
.sp
.LP
If the line in the \fByppasswdd\fR file is commented out (the default), the \fBrpc.yppasswdd\fR daemon does not perform the restricted shell check.
.sp
.LP
The \fByppasswdd\fR file is editable only by root or a member of the sys group.
