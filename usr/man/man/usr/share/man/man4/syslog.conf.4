.SH NAME
syslog.conf \- configuration file for syslogd system log daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR contains information used by the system log daemon, \fBsyslogd\fR(1M), to forward a system message to appropriate log files and/or users. \fBsyslogd\fR preprocesses this file through \fBm4\fR(1) to obtain the correct information for certain log files, defining \fBLOGHOST\fR if the address of \fBloghost\fR is the same as one of the addresses of the host that is running \fBsyslogd\fR.
.sp
.LP
A configuration entry is composed of two TAB-separated fields:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIselector		action\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIselector\fR field contains a semicolon-separated list of priority specifications of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIfacility\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIlevel\fR [ \fB;\fR \fIfacility\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIlevel\fR ]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where \fIfacility\fR is a system facility, or comma-separated list of facilities, and \fIlevel\fR is an indication of the severity of the condition being logged. Recognized values for \fIfacility\fR include:
.sp

Do not send messages from the indicated \fIfacility\fR to the selected file. For example, a \fIselector\fR of
.sp
\fB*.debug;mail.none\fR
.sp
sends all messages \fIexcept\fR mail messages to the selected file.
.RE

.sp
.LP
For a given \fIfacility\fR and \fIlevel\fR, \fBsyslogd\fR matches all messages for that level and all higher levels. For example, an entry that specifies a level of \fBcrit\fR also logs messages at the \fBalert\fR and \fBemerg\fR levels.
.sp
.LP
The \fIaction\fR field indicates where to forward the message. Values for this field can have one of four forms:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A filename, beginning with a leading slash, which indicates that messages specified by the \fIselector\fR are to be written to the specified file. The file is opened in append mode if it exists. If the file does not exist, logging silently fails for this action.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The name of a remote host, prefixed with an \fB@\fR, as with: \fB@\fR\fIserver\fR, which indicates that messages specified by the \fIselector\fR are to be forwarded to the \fBsyslogd\fR on the named host. The hostname \fBloghost\fR is treated, in the default \fBsyslog.conf\fR, as the hostname given to the machine that logs \fBsyslogd\fR messages. Every machine is \fBloghost\fR by default, per the hosts database. It is also possible to specify one machine on a network to be \fBloghost\fR by, literally, naming the machine \fBloghost\fR. If the local machine is designated to be \fBloghost\fR, then \fBsyslogd\fR messages are written to the appropriate files. Otherwise, they are sent to the machine \fBloghost\fR on the network.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A comma-separated list of usernames, which indicates that messages specified by the \fIselector\fR are to be written to the named users if they are logged in.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An asterisk, which indicates that messages specified by the \fIselector\fR are to be written to all logged-in users.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Blank lines are ignored. Lines for which the first nonwhite character is a '\fB#\fR' are treated as comments.

.sp
.LP
\fBsyslogd\fR(1M) logs all mail system messages except \fBdebug\fR messages and all \fBnotice\fR (or higher) messages into a file named \fB/var/log/notice\fR. It logs all critical messages into \fB/var/log/critical\fR, and all kernel messages and 20-minute marks onto the system console.

.sp
.LP
Kernel messages of \fBerr\fR (error) severity or higher are forwarded to the machine named \fBserver\fR. Emergency messages are forwarded to all users. The users \fBroot\fR and \fBoperator\fR are informed of any \fBalert\fR messages. All messages from the authorization system of \fBwarning\fR level or higher are logged in the file \fB/var/log/auth\fR.
