.SH NAME
depend \- software dependencies file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdepend\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file used to specify information concerning software dependencies for a particular package. The file is created by a software developer.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBdepend\fR file describes a single software package. The instance of the package is described after the entry line by giving the package architecture and/or version. The format of each entry and subsequent instance definition is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fItype pkg name\fR
\fI(arch)version\fR
 	\fI(arch)version\fR
        ...
.fi
.in -2

The fields are:
.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fBtype\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Defines the dependency type. Must be one of the following characters: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBP\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Indicates a prerequisite for installation; for example, the referenced package or versions must be installed.

\fB\fBI\fR\fR

.RS 5n
.rt  
Implies that the existence of the indicated package or version is incompatible.

\fB\fBR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Indicates a reverse dependency. Instead of defining the package's own dependencies, this designates that another package depends on this one. This type should be used only when an old package does not have a \fBdepend\fR file, but relies on the newer package nonetheless. Therefore, the present package should not be removed if the designated old package is still on the system since, if it is removed, the old package will no longer work.

.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Specifies a particular instance of the software. A version name cannot begin with a left parenthesis. The instance specifications, both \fI(arch)\fR and \fIversion\fR, are completely optional, but each \fI(arch)version\fR pair must begin on a new line that begins with white space. A null version set equates to any version of the indicated package.
