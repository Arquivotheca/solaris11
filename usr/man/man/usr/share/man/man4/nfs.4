.SH NAME
nfs \- file containing parameter values for NFS-related daemons
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/default/nfs\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The settings formerly managed by the \fBnfs\fR file have been moved to SMF properties and are now managed by \fBsharectl\fR(1M). The functionality described here is provided for backward compatibility only.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnfs\fR file resides in directory \fB/etc/default\fR and provides startup parameters for the \fBnfsd\fR(1M) and \fBlockd\fR(1M) daemons.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnfs\fR file format is \fBASCII\fR; comment lines begin with the crosshatch (\fB#\fR) character. Parameters consist of a keyword followed by an equals (\fB=\fR) sign followed by the parameter value, of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIkeyword\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following parameters are currently supported in the \fBnfs\fR file:
.sp

.na
\fB\fBNFS_CLIENT_VERSMIN=\fR\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fBNFS_CLIENT_VERSMAX=\fR\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The NFS client only uses NFS versions in the range specified by these variables. Valid values or versions are: \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, and \fB4\fR. By default these variables are unspecified (commented out) and the client's default minimum is Version 2. The default maximum is Version 4. You can override this range on a per-mount basis by using the \fB-o vers=\fR option to \fBmount_nfs\fR(1M).

\fB\fBNFS_SERVER_VERSMAX=\fR\fInum\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The NFS server only uses NFS versions in the range specified by these variables. Valid values or versions are: \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, and \fB4\fR. As with the client, the default is to leave these variables commented out and the default minimum version is \fB2\fR, while the default maximum version is \fB4\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNFS_SERVER_DELEGATION=on | off\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
By default, this variable is commented out and the NFS server provides delegations to clients. The user can turn off delegations for all exported filesystems by setting this variable to \fBoff\fR (case-sensitive). This variable only applies to NFS Version 4.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN=\fR\fIdomain-string\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
By default, the \fBnfsmapid\fR uses the DNS domain of the system. This setting overrides the default. This domain is used for identifying user and group attribute strings in the NFS Version 4 protocol. Clients and servers must match with this domain for operation to proceed normally. This variable only applies to NFS Version 4. See "Setting \fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN\fR," below for further details.
.RE

\fB\fBNFSD_MAX_CONNECTIONS=\fR\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the maximum number of concurrent, connection-oriented connections. The default is unlimited and is obtained by not setting (that is, commenting out) \fBNFSD_MAX_CONNECTIONS\fR. Equivalent to the \fB-c\fR option in \fBnfsd\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNFSD_LISTEN_BACKLOG=\fR\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set connection queue length for the NFS over a connection-oriented transport. The default value is 32, meaning 32 entries in the queue. Equivalent to the \fB-l\fR option in \fBnfsd\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNFSD_PROTOCOL=ALL\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Start \fBnfsd\fR over the specified protocol only. Equivalent to the \fB-p\fR option in \fBnfsd\fR. \fBALL\fR is equivalent to \fB-a\fR on the \fBnfsd\fR command line. Mutually exclusive of \fBNFSD_DEVICE\fR. One or the other of \fBNFSD_DEVICE\fR and \fBNFSD_PROTOCOL\fR must be commented out. For the UDP protocol, only version 2 and version 3 service is established. NFS Version 4 is not supported for the UDP protocol.

\fB\fBNFSD_DEVICE=\fR\fIdevname\fR\fR

Grace period, in seconds, that all clients (both \fBNLM\fR and \fBNFSv4\fR) have to reclaim locks after a server reboot. This parameter also controls the \fBNFSv4\fR lease interval and overrides the deprecated setting \fBLOCKD_GRACE_PERIOD\fR. The default is \fB90\fR.

.SS "Setting \fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN\fR"
.sp
.LP
As described above, the setting for \fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN\fR overrides the domain used by \fBnfsmapid\fR(1M) for building and comparing outbound and inbound attribute strings, respectively. This setting overrides any other mechanism for setting the NFSv4 domain. In the absence of a \fBNFSMAPID_DOMAIN\fR setting, the \fBnfsmapid\fR(1M) daemon determines the NFSv4 domain as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If a properly configured \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR (see \fBresolv.conf\fR(4)) exists, \fBnfsmapid\fR queries specified nameservers for the domain.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If a properly configured \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR (see \fBresolv.conf\fR(4)) exists, but the queried nameserver does not have a proper record of the domain name, \fBnfsmapid\fR attempts to obtain the domain name through the BIND interface (see \fBresolver\fR(3RESOLV)).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If no \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR exists, \fBnfsmapid\fR falls back on using the configured domain name (see \fBdomainname\fR(1M)), which is returned with the leading domain suffix removed. For example, for \fBwidgets.sales.acme.com\fR, \fBsales.acme.com\fR is returned.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR does not exist, no domain name has been configured (or no \fB/etc/defaultdomain\fR exists), \fBnfsmapid\fR falls back on obtaining the domain name from the host name, if the host name contains a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
.RE
.sp
.LP
If a domainname is still not obtained following all of the preceding steps, \fBnfsmapid\fR has no domain configured. This results in the following behavior:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Outbound \fBowner\fR and \fBowner_group\fR attribute strings are encoded as literal id's. For example, the UID 12345 is encoded as \fB12345\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBnfsmapid\fR ignores the "domain" portion of the inbound attribute string and performs name service lookups only for the user or group. If the user/group exists in the local system name service databases, then the proper uid/gid is mapped even when no domain has been configured.
.sp
This behavior implies that the same administrative user/group domain exists between NFSv4 client and server (that is, the same uid/gid's for users/groups on both client and server). In the case of overlapping id spaces, the inbound attribute string could potentially be mapped to the wrong id. However, this is not functionally different from mapping the inbound string to \fBnobody\fR, yet provides greater flexibility.
