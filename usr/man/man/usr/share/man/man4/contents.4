\fB/var/sadm/install/contents\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/var/sadm/install/contents\fR is a source of information about the packages installed on the system. This file must never be edited directly. Always use the package and patch commands (see SEE ALSO) to make changes to the \fBcontents\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBcontents\fR file is a single line. Fields in each entry are separated by a single space character.
.sp
.LP
Two major styles of entries exist, old style and new style. The following is the format of an old-style entry:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIftype\fR \fIclass\fR \fIpath\fR \fIpackage(s)\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The following is the general format of a new-style entry:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIpath\fR[=\fIrpath\fR] \fIftype\fR \fIclass\fR [\fIftype-optional-fields\fR] \fIpackage(s)\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
New-style entries differ for each \fBftype\fR. The \fBftype\fR designates the entry type, as specified in \fBpkgmap\fR(4). The format for new-style entries, for each \fBftype\fR, is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ftype s: \fIpath\fR=\fIrpath\fR s \fIclass\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype l: \fIpath\fR l \fIclass\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype d: \fIpath\fR d \fIclass\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIpackage(s)\fR
ftype b: \fIpath\fR b \fIclass\fR \fImajor\fR \fIminor\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype c: \fIpath\fR c \fIclass\fR \fImajor\fR \fIminor\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype f: \fIpath\fR f \fIclass\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIsize\fR \fIcksum\fR \fImodtime\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype x: \fIpath\fR x \fIclass\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype v: \fIpath\fR v \fIclass\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIsize\fR \fIcksum\fR \fImodtime\fR \fIpackage\fR
ftype e: \fIpath\fR e \fIclass\fR \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIsize\fR \fIcksum\fR \fImodtime\fR \fIpackage\fR

A significant distinction between old- and new-style entries is that the former do not begin with a slash (/) character, while the latter (new-style) always do. For example, the following are old-style entries:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
d none /dev SUNWcsd
e passwd /etc/passwd SUNWcsr
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The following are new-style entries:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/dev d none 0755 root sys SUNWcsr SUNWcsd
/etc/passwd e passwd 0644 root sys 580 48299 1077177419 SUNWcsr
.fi
.in -2

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
As shown above, the interface stability of \fB/var/sadm/install/contents\fR is Uncommitted (see \fBattributes\fR(5)). It is common practice to use this file in a read-only manner to determine which files belong to which packages installed on a system. While this file has been present for many releases of the Solaris operating system, it might not be present in future releases. The fully supported way to obtain information from the installed package database is through \fBpkgchk\fR(1M). It is highly recommended that you use \fBpkgchk\fR rather than relying on the \fBcontents\fR file.
