.SH NAME
admin \- installation defaults file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBadmin\fR is a generic name for an \fBASCII\fR file that defines default installation actions by assigning values to installation parameters. For example, it allows administrators to define how to proceed when the package being installed already exists on the system.
.sp
.LP
\fB/var/sadm/install/admin/default\fR is the default \fBadmin\fR file delivered with this release. The default file is not writable, so to assign values different from this file, create a new \fBadmin\fR file. There are no naming restrictions for \fBadmin\fR files. Name the file when installing a package with the \fB-a\fR option of \fBpkgadd\fR(1M). If the \fB-a\fR option is not used, the default \fBadmin\fR file is used.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBadmin\fR file is a line that establishes the value of a parameter in the following form:
.sp
.LP
\fIparam\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
.sp
.LP
All of the parameters listed below can be defined in an \fBadmin\fR file, but it is not required to assign values to all of these. If a value is not assigned, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) asks the installer how to proceed.
.sp
.LP
The valid parameters and their possible values are shown below except as noted. They can be specified in any order. Any of these parameters (except the \fBmail\fR and \fBproxy\fR parameters) can be assigned the value \fBask\fR, which means that, when the parameter is reached during the installation sequence, the installer is notified and asked to supply instructions (see \fBNOTES\fR).
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbasedir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indicates the base directory where relocatable packages are to be installed. If there is no \fBbasedir\fR entry in the file, the installer will be prompted for a path name, as if the file contained the entry \fBbasedir=ask\fR. This parameter can also be set to \fBdefault\fR (entry is \fBbasedir=default\fR). In this instance, the package is installed into the base directory specified by the \fBBASEDIR\fR parameter in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBmail\fR\fR
.ad

.RS 4n
Defines a list of users to whom mail should be sent following installation of a package. If the list is empty, no mail is sent. If the parameter is not present in the \fBadmin\fR file, the default value of \fBroot\fR is used. The \fBask\fR value cannot be used with this parameter.

.RE

If this parameter is not present or has a null value, the user \fBnoaccess\fR is assumed. Likewise, if this parameter is set to anything other than the values described here, a warning is issued, and \fBnoaccess\fR is assumed. \fBrscriptalt\fR is not present in the default  \fBadmin\fR file, \fB/var/sadm/install/admin/default\fR. In this case, request scripts are run as the user \fBnoaccess\fR.

The value \fBask\fR should not be defined in an \fBadmin\fR file that will be used for non-interactive installation (because, by definition, there is no installer interaction). Doing so causes installation to fail at the point when input is needed.
