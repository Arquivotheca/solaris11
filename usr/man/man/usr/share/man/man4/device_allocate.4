.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdevice_allocate\fR file is an \fBASCII\fR file that resides in the \fB/etc/security\fR directory. It contains mandatory access control information about each physical device. Each device is represented by a one- line entry of the form:
.sp
.LP
\fIdevice-name\fR;\fIdevice-type\fR;reserved1;reserved2;\fIauths\fR;\fIdevice-exec\fR
.sp
.LP
where:
.sp

\fB\fIdevice-name\fR\fR

.sp .6

Represents an arbitrary \fBASCII\fR string naming the physical device. This field contains no embedded white space or non-printable characters.

.RS 4n
Represents an arbitrary \fBASCII\fR string naming the generic device type. This field identifies and groups together devices of like type. This field contains no embedded white space or non-printable characters. The following types of devices are currently managed by the system: audio, \fBsr\fR (represents CDROM drives), \fBst\fR (represents tape drives), and \fBrmdisk\fR (removable media devices).

On systems configured with Trusted Extensions, this field stores a colon-separated (\fB:\fR) list of key-value pairs that describe device allocation attributes used in Trusted Extensions. Zero or more keys can be specified. The following keys are currently interpreted by Trusted Extensions systems:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBminlabel\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the minimum label at which device can be allocated. Default value is \fBadmin_low\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBmaxlabel\fR\fR

.sp .6

Specifies the maximum label at which device can be allocated. Default value is \fBadmin_high\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

Specifies the name of the zone in which device is currently allocated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBclass\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies  a  logical grouping of devices. For example, all Sun Ray devices of all device types. There is no default  class.

.RS 4n
Represents a field that contains a comma-separated list of authorizations required to allocate the device, an asterisk (\fB*\fR) to indicate that the device is \fInot\fR allocatable, or an '\fB@\fR' symbol to indicate that no explicit authorization is needed to allocate the device. The default authorization is \fBsolaris.device.allocate\fR. See \fBauths\fR(1).

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The physical device's data clean program to be run any time the device is acted on by \fBallocate\fR(1). This ensures that unmanaged data does not remain in the physical device between uses. This field contains the filename of a program in \fB/etc/security/lib\fR or the full pathname of a cleanup script provided by the system administrator.

.SS "Notes on \fBdevice_allocate\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBdevice_allocate\fR file is an ASCII file that resides in the \fB/etc/security\fR directory.
.sp
.LP
Lines in \fBdevice_allocate\fR can end with a `\fB\e\fR\&' to continue an entry on the next line.
.sp
.LP
Comments can also be included. A `\fB#\fR' makes a comment of all further text until the next NEWLINE not immediately preceded by a `\fB\e\fR\&'.
.sp
.LP
White space is allowed in any field.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdevice_allocate\fR file must be created by the system administrator before device allocation is enabled.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdevice_allocate\fR file is owned by root, with a group of \fBsys\fR, and a mode of 0644.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRDeclaring an Allocatable Device
.sp
.LP
Declare that physical device \fBst0\fR is a type \fBst\fR. \fBst\fR is allocatable, and the script used to clean the device after running \fBdeallocate\fR(1) is named \fB/etc/security/lib/st_clean\fR.

Making a device allocatable means that you need to allocate and deallocate it to use it (with \fBallocate\fR(1) and \fBdeallocate\fR(1)). If a device is not allocatable, there is an asterisk (\fB*\fR) in the \fIauths\fR field, and no one can use the device.
