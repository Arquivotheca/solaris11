.SH NAME
kadm5.acl \- Kerberos access control list (ACL) file 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/krb5/kadm5.acl\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBACL\fR file is used by the \fBkadmind\fR(1M) command to determine which principals are allowed to perform Kerberos administration actions. For operations that affect principals, the \fBACL\fR file also controls which principals can operate on which other principals. The location of the \fBACL\fR file is determined by the \fBacl_file\fR configuration variable in the \fBkdc.conf\fR(4) file. The default location is \fB/etc/krb5/kadm5.acl\fR.
.sp
.LP
For incremental propagation, see \fBkadmind\fR(1M). The ACL file must contain the \fBkiprop\fR service principal with propagation privileges in order for the slave KDC to pull updates from the master's principal database. Refer to the EXAMPLES section for this case.
.sp
.LP
The \fBACL\fR file can contain comment lines, null lines, or lines that contain \fBACL\fR entries. Comment lines start with the pound sign (\fB#\fR) and continue until the end of the line. 
.sp
.LP
The order of entries is significant. The first matching entry specifies the principal on which the control access applies, whether it is on just the principal or on the principal when it operates on a target principal.
.sp
.LP
Lines containing \fBACL\fR entries must have the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIprincipal\fR \fIoperation-mask\fR [\fIoperation-target\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIprincipal\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies the principal on which the \fIoperation-mask\fR applies. Can specify either a partially or fully qualified Kerberos principal name. Each component of the name can be substituted with a wildcard, using the asterisk ( \fB*\fR ) character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIoperation-mask\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies what operations can or cannot be performed by a principal matching a particular entry. Specify \fIoperation-mask\fR as one or more \fIprivilege\fRs. 
.sp
A \fIprivilege\fR is a string of one or more of the following characters: \fBa\fR, \fBA\fR, \fBc\fR, \fBC\fR, \fBd\fR, \fBD\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBI\fR, \fBl\fR, \fBL\fR, \fBm\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBp\fR, \fBP\fR, \fBu\fR, \fBU\fR, \fBx\fR, or \fB*\fR. Generally, if the character is lowercase, the privilege is allowed and if the character is uppercase, the operation is disallowed. The \fBx\fR and \fB*\fR characters are exceptions to the uppercase convention.

Optional. When specified, the \fIprivileges\fR apply to the \fIprincipal\fR when it operates on the \fIoperation-target\fR.
