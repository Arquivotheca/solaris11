.SH NAME
sata \- Solaris SATA framework
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Serial ATA is an interconnect technology designed to replace parallel ATA technology. It is used to connect hard drives, optical drives, removable magnetic media devices and other peripherals to the host system. For complete information on Serial ATA technology, visit the Serial ATA web site at http://\fIwww.serialata.org\fR.
.sp
.LP
Up to 32 SATA devices may be plugged directly to each SATA HBA and up to 15 SATA devices may be plugged directly to each SATA port multiplier supported by the Solaris SATA framework. The actual number of pluggable devices my be lower, and is limited by the number of device ports on the SATA HBA or the SATA port multiplier. The maximum data rate is either 1.5Gb/sec. or 3.0Gb/sec., depending on the capability of a SATA device, port multiplier and SATA HBA controller.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris SATA framework adheres to the \fISerial ATA 1.0a\fR specification and supports SATA-2 signaling speed 3.0Gb/sec. SATA devices that are connected to SATA HBAs controlled by a SATA framework-compliant HBA driver are treated by the system as SCSI devices. The Solaris SCSI disk driver (\fBsd\fR(7D)) is attached as a target driver for each device node created by the SATA framework. You can use the \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) utility to manage hot plugged and unplugged SATA devices.

\fBSATA port X failed.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The specified SATA device port failed and is in an unusable state. You can change the port state by deactivating the port and activating it again using cfgadm SATA hardware-specific commands (see \fBcfgadm_sata\fR(1M)).
