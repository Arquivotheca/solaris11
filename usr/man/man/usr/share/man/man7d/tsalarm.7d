.SH NAME
tsalarm \- Alarm device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
tsalarm@0:ctl
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtsalarm\fR driver is a Multi-threaded, loadable non-STREAMS pseudo driver that manages ALOM alarms. The \fBtsalarm\fR driver provides an interface through which alarm relays can be controlled on SUNW,Netra-240 and SUNW,Netra-440 platforms.
.SH HARDWARE INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
The alarm hardware differs depending on platform. The Netra 240 and 440 platforms features four dry contact alarm relays       which are controlled by ALOM. You can set each alarm to "on" or "off" by  using ioctl interfaces provided from the host. The four alarms are labeled as "critical," "major," "minor," and "user." The user alarm is set by a user application depending on system condition. LED's in front of the box provide a visual indication of the four alarms. The number of alarms and their meanings/labels may vary across platforms.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The interface provided by the \fBtsalarm\fR driver comprises ioctls that enable applications to manipulate the alarm module. The alarm  module is accessed via two device nodes:  i) \fB/dev/lom\fR and \fB/dev/tsalarm:ctl\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following ioctls are supported by  the \fB/dev/lom\fR and \fB/dev/tsalarm:ctl\fR devices:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTSIOCALCTL - Turn an alarm on or off.\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The argument is a pointer to the \fBts_aldata_t/lom_aldata_t\fR structure. This structure is described below. \fBalarm_no member\fR is an integer which specifies the alarm to which the command is to be applied. The \fBalarm_state/state\fR structure member indicates the state to which the alarm should be set (where 0 == off). An error  (\fBEINVAL\fR) is returned if either an invalid alarm_no or invalid alarm_state is provided.

\fB\fBTSIOCALSTATE - Get the state of the alarms.\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The argument is a pointer to the \fBts_aldata_t/lom_aldata_t\fR structure. This structure is described below. \fBalarm_no member\fR is an integer which indicates the alarm to which the command will be applied. The  \fBalarm_state\fR member holds the alarm's current state and is filled in by the driver. A zero indicates that the alarm is off. An error (\fBEINVAL\fR) is returned if an invalid alarm_no is provided. The structures and definitions for the  values  are defined below.

  Alarm values defined in <lom.io.h>
