.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Sockets Direct Protocol (\fBSDP\fR) is a transport protocol layered over the \fIInfiniband Transport Framework\fR (\fBIBTF\fR). \fBSDP\fR is a standard implementation based on Annex 4 of the \fIInfiniband Architecture Specification Vol 1\fR and provides reliable byte-stream, flow controlled two-way data transmission that closely mimics the Transmission Control Protocol (\fBTCP\fR).
.sp
.LP
\fBSDP\fR supports a sockets-based SOCK_STREAM interface to application programs. It also supports graceful close (including half-closed sockets), IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6), the connecting/accepting connect model, out-of-band (OOB) data and common socket options. The \fBSDP\fR protocol also supports kernel bypass data transfers and data transfers from send-upper-layer-protocol (ULP) buffers to receive ULP buffers. A \fBSDP\fR message includes a BSDH header followed by data. (A BSDH header advertises the amount of available buffers on the local side).
.sp
.LP
\fBSDP\fR networking functionality is broken into the \fBsdp\fR driver and a function call-based sockfs implementation. A new protocol family of PROTO_SDP is introduced to use the \fBSDP\fR transport provided by the driver.
.sp
.LP
Sockets utilizing \fBSDP\fR are either active or passive. Active sockets initiate connections to passive sockets. Both active and passive sockets must have their local IP or IPv6 address and \fBSDP\fR port number bound with the \fBbind\fR(3SOCKET) system call after the socket is created. By default, \fBSDP\fR sockets are active. A passive socket is created by calling the \fBlisten\fR(3SOCKET) system call after binding the socket with bind(). This process establishes a queueing parameter for the passive socket. Connections to the passive  socket can be received with the \fBaccept\fR(3SOCKET) system call. Active sockets use the \fBconnect\fR(3SOCKET) call after binding to initiate connections.
.sp
.LP
In most cases, \fBSDP\fR sends data when it is presented. When outstanding  data is not yet acknowledged, \fBSDP\fR gathers small amounts of output to be sent in a single  packet once an acknowledgement is received. For a small number of clients this packetization may cause significant delays. To circumvent this problem,  \fBSDP\fR provided by the driver supplies SDP_NODELAY, a socket-level boolean option. Note that this behavior is similar to the TCP_NODELAY option.
.sp
.LP
\fBSDP\fR provides an urgent data mechanism that can be invoked using the out-of-band provisions of  \fBsend\fR(3SOCKET). The out-of-band delivery behavior is identical to TCP. The caller may mark one byte as "urgent" with the  MSG_OOB  flag to \fBsend\fR(3SOCKET). This sets an "urgent pointer" pointing to the byte in the \fBSDP\fR stream. The receiver of the stream is notified of the urgent data by a \fBSIGURG\fR signal. The SIOCATMARK  \fBioctl\fR(2) request returns a value indicating whether the stream is at the urgent mark. Because the system never returns data across the urgent  mark in a single \fBread\fR(2) call, it is possible to advance to the urgent data in a simple loop which reads data, testing  the  socket with the \fBSIOCATMARK\fR  ioctl() request until it reaches the mark.
.SH ADDRESS FORMATS
.sp
.LP
\fBSDP\fR uses  IP/IPv6  addresses to refer to local and remote devices and opens a reliable connected IB connection between two end points. The \fBsdp\fR driver supports a point-to-point connection, however broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.
.SH SOCKET OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
\fBSDP\fR supports setsockopt and getsockopt to set and read socket options. Very few socket options affect \fBSDP\fR protocol operations. Other common socket options are  processed but do not affect  SDP  protocol  operation. All socket options are checked for validity. A getsockopt returns the values set or toggled by setsockopt. Socket options that affect protocol operations are SO_LINGER, SO_DEBUG, SO_REUSEADDR and SO_OOBINLINE.
