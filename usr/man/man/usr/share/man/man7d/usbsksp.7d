.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsksp\fR driver is a loadable \fBSTREAMS\fR and \fBUSBA\fR (Solaris USB architecture) compliant client driver that provides basic asynchronous communication support for Keyspan USB-to-serial converters. The \fBusbsksp\fR driver supports the Keyspan USA19HS, USA49WG and USA49WLC models. By default, the USA19HS and USA49WG models are compatible with the \fBusbsksp\fR driver and no configuration or installation steps are required.  (The USA49WG model is a USB 2.0 device comforming to \fIUniversal Serial Bus Specification 2.0\fR and the USB 2.0 host controller is required to support the USA49WG model. Note that the USA49WG is not compatible with USB 1.1 host controllers). If you use the Keyspan USA49WLC model, you must download and install a firmware package to enable the device to work with the \fBusbsksp\fR driver. See the Keyspan website (\fIhttp://www.keyspan.com/downloads/sun/\fR) for more information. Serial device streams are built with appropriate modules that  are  pushed atop the \fBusbsksp\fR driver by the \fBautopush\fR(1M) facility. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsksp\fR module supports the \fBtermio\fR(7I) device control functions specified by flags in the \fBc_cflag\fR word of the termios structure, and by the IGNBRK,  IGNPAR,  PARMRK and INPCK flags in the \fBc_iflag\fR word of the termios structure. All other \fBtermio\fR(7I) functions must be performed by \fBSTREAMS\fR modules pushed atop the driver. When a device is opened, the \fBldterm\fR(7M) and \fBttcompat\fR(7M)  \fBSTREAMS\fR modules are automatically pushed on top of the stream, providing the standard \fBtermio\fR(7I) interface. 
.sp
.LP
Use device logical names \fB/dev/term/[0-9]\fR*  to  access  the serial ports. These names are typically used to provide a logical access point for a dial-in line that is used with a modem.
.sp
.LP
A special feature (controlled by the minor device number) is available that enables a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for incoming and outgoing calls. By accessing through device logical name \fB/dev/cua/[0-9]\fR*, you can open a port without  the carrier detect signal being asserted, either through hardware or an equivalent software mechanism. These devices are commonly known as  'dial-out' lines.
.sp
.LP
Unlike onboard serial ports, the \fBusbsksp\fR ports  cannot serve as a local serial console.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
A dial-in line can be opened only if the corresponding dial-out line is closed. A blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open waits until the \fB/dev/cua\fR line is closed (which drops Data Terminal Ready, after which Carrier Detect usually drops as well) and carrier is detected again.  A non-blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open returns an error if the \fB/dev/cua\fR is open. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB/dev/term\fR line is opened successfully  (usually  only when  carrier is recognized on the modem), the corresponding \fB/dev/cua\fR line cannot be opened. This allows a modem and port to be used  for dial-in (by enabling the line for login in \fB/etc/inittab\fR) or dial-out (by \fBtip\fR(1), or \fBuucp\fR(1C)) when no one is logged in on the line.
.sp
.LP
Device hot-removal  is functionally equivalent to a modem disconnect event, as defined in \fBtermio\fR(7I).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBusbsksp\fR driver supports the  standard set of \fBtermio\fR(7I) ioctl calls.
.sp
.LP
Input and output line speeds can be set to the following baud rates:  0, 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,  19200,  38400,  57600,  115200, or 230400.  Input and output line speeds cannot be set independently. For example, when the output speed is set, the input speed is automatically set to the same speed.
