.SH NAME
ncp \- UltraSPARC T1 server crypto provider device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBncp\fR device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting hardware assisted acceleration of RSA and DSA cryptographic operations. This support is built into the UltraSPARC T1 processor.
.sp
.LP
The \fBncp\fR driver requires the presence of the \fISolaris Cryptographic Framework\fR to enable applications and kernel clients to access the provided services.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
You configure the \fBncp\fR driver by defining  properties in \fB/platform/sun4v/kernel/drv/ncp.conf\fR which override the default settings. The following property is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnostats\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Disables the generation of  statistics. The \fBnostats\fR property may be used to help prevent traffic  analysis, but this may inhibit support personnel.

.SH NETWORK STATISTICS
.sp
.LP
Solaris network drivers must implement statistics variables. The \fBncp\fR driver maintains the following statistics:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmauXqfull\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Number of times the queue for MAU X was found full when attempting to submit jobs.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmauXupdate_failure\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Number of submit job failures on MAU X.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmauXsubmit\fR
