qlc \- ISP2200, ISP2300, and SP212 Family Fibre Channel host bus adapter driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBqlc\fR host bus adapter driver is a Sun Fibre Channel transport  layer-compliant  nexus driver for the Qlogic ISP2200, ISP2200A,  ISP2310, ISP2312, and SP212 adapters. These adapters support  Fibre Channel SCSI and  IP Protocols, FC-AL public loop profile, point-to-point fabric connection and Fibre  Channel service classes two and three (see NOTES section below).
.sp
.LP
The \fBqlc\fR driver interfaces with the Sun Fibre Channel transport  layer to support the standard functions provided by the SCSA interface. It  supports auto request sense and tagged  queueing by default. The driver requires that all devices have unique hard addresses in private loop configurations. Devices with conflicting hard addresses are not accessible.

.SH NOTES

.LP
 SP-212-based host bus adapters (including QLA-210) are supported on x86 platforms only and are limited to a maximum of 8  targets in fabric and sixteen targets in local loop topology. FL topology is not supported with the SP-212-based host bus adapter.
