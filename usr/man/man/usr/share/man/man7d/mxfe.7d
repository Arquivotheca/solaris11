.SH NAME
mxfe \- MXFE Fast Ethernet device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmxfe\fR is a Solaris STREAMS hardware driver supporting the Data Link Provider Interface (\fBdlpi\fR(7P)) over the Macronix 98715 family (including the Lite-On PNIC-II) of Fast Ethernet controllers.
.SH DLPI SPECIFICATIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmxfe\fR driver supports both style 1 and style 2 modes of operation. Physical points of attachment (PPAs) are interpreted as the instance number of the  \fBmxfe\fR controller as assigned by the operating system.

If the SAP provided is zero, \fIIEEE 802.3\fR mode is assumed and outbound frames will have the frame payload length written into the type field Likewise, inbound  frames with a SAP between zero and 1500 are interpreted as \fIIEEE 802.3\fR frames and delivered to streams that have bound to SAP zero (the \fI802.3\fR SAP).
