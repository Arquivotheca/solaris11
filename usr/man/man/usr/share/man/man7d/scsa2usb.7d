.SH NAME
scsa2usb \- SCSI to USB bridge driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBstorage@unit-address\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa2usb\fR driver is a \fBUSBA\fR (Solaris USB architecture) compliant nexus driver that supports the \fIUSB Mass Storage Bulk Only Transport Specification 1.0\fR and \fIUSB Control/Bulk/Interrupt (CBI) Transport Specification 1.0\fR. The \fBscsa2usb\fR driver also supports USB storage devices that implement CBI Transport without the interrupt completion for status (that is, Control/Bulk (CB) devices.) It supports bus-powered and self-powered USB mass storage devices. This nexus driver is both a USB client driver and a \fBSCSA\fR HBA driver. As such, the \fBscsa2usb\fR driver only supports storage devices that utilize the above two transports. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa2usb\fR driver also supports a \fBugen\fR(7D) interface allowing raw access to the device, for example by \fBlibusb\fR(3LIB) applications, bypassing the child \fBsd\fR(7D) or \fBst\fR(7D) driver. Because a libusb application might change the state of the device, you should not access the disk or tape concurrently.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa2usb\fR nexus driver maps \fBSCSA\fR target driver requests to \fBUSBA\fR client driver requests.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa2usb\fR driver creates a child device info node for each logical unit (LUN) on the mass storage device. The standard Solaris \fBSCSI\fR disk driver or tape driver is attached to those nodes. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D) or \fBst\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
This driver supports multiple LUN devices and creates a separate child device info node for each LUN. All child LUN nodes attach to \fBsd\fR(7D) for disks or \fBst\fR(7D) for tapes. 
.sp
.LP
In previous releases, all USB disk storage devices were treated as removable media devices and managed by \fBrmformat\fR(1) and volume management software. In the current release, however, only disk storage devices with a removable bit (RMB) value of \fB1\fR are removable. (The RMB is part of the device's SCSI INQUIRY data.) See SCSI specifications T10/995D Revision 11a, T10/1236-D Revision 20 or T10/1416-D Revision 23 for more information. However, for backward compatibility, all USB disk storage devices can still be managed by \fBrmformat\fR(1). With or without a volume  manager,  you can  mount, eject, hot remove and hot insert a  1394 mass storage device as the following sections explain. 
.sp
.LP
Some devices may be supported by the USB mass storage driver even though they do not identify themselves as compliant with the USB mass storage class.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa2usb.conf\fR file contains an \fBattribute-override-list\fR that lists the vendor ID, product ID, and revision for matching mass storage devices, as well as fields for overriding the default device attributes. The entries in this list are commented out by default and may be uncommented to enable support of particular devices.
.sp
.LP
Follow the information given in the \fBscsa2usb.conf\fR file to see if a particular device can be supported using the override information. Also see http:/\fI/www.sun.com/io\fR. For example, by adding the following to the \fBscsa2usb.conf\fR file, many USB memory sticks and card readers might operate more reliably:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
attribute-override-list = "vid=* reduced-cmd-support=true";
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note that this override applies to all USB mass storage devices and might be inappropriate for a USB CD writer. If so, you can add an entry for each device to the attribute override list.
.sp
.LP
If USB mass storage support is considered a security risk, this driver can be disabled in \fB/etc/system\fR as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
exclude: scsa2usb
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Alternatively, you can disable automatic handling of a device as described in the following subsection.
.SS "Using Volume Management"
.sp
.LP
Disk storage devices are managed by Volume Manager. Software that manages removable media creates a device nickname that can be listed with \fBeject\fR(1) or \fBrmmount\fR(1). A device that is not mounted automatically can be mounted using \fBrmmount\fR(1) under \fB/rmdisk/\fIlabel\fR\fR. Note that the \fBmount\fR(1M) and \fBmount\fR(1M) commands do not accept nicknames; you must use explicit device names with these commands.
.sp
.LP
See \fBrmmount\fR(1) to unmount the device and \fBeject\fR(1) to eject the media. If the device is ejected while it is mounted, volume management software unmounts the device before ejecting it. It also might kill any active applications that are accessing the device.
.sp
.LP
Volume management software is hotplug-aware and normally mounts file systems on USB mass storage devices if the file system is recognized. Before hot removing the USB device, use \fBeject\fR(1) to unmount the file system. After the device is removed, a console warning, such as "The disconnected device was busy, please reconnect," might display. The warning is harmless and you can ignore it.
.sp
.LP
You can disable the automatic mounting and unmounting of removable devices by inserting a entry for a removable device in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. In this entry, you must set the \fBmount at boot\fR field to \fBno\fR. See \fBvfstab\fR(4). See the \fISystem Administration Guide, Volume I\fR.
.SS "Using \fBmount\fR and \fBumount\fR"
.sp
.LP
Use \fBmount\fR(1M) to explicitly mount the device and \fBumount\fR(1M) to unmount the device. Use \fBeject\fR(1) to eject the media. After you have explicitly mounted a removable device, you cannot use a nickname as an argument to \fBeject\fR.
.sp
.LP
Removing the disk device while it is being accessed or mounted fails with a console warning. To hot remove the disk device from the system, unmount the file system, then kill all applications accessing the device. Next, hot remove the device. A storage device can be hot inserted at any time. 
.sp
.LP
For a comprehensive listing of (non-bootable) USB mass-storage devices that are compatible with this driver, see \fBwww.sun.com/io\fR.
.SH DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
.sp
.LP
Disk block special file names are located in \fB/dev/dsk\fR, while raw file names are located in \fB/dev/rdsk\fR. Tape raw file names are located in \fB/dev/rmt\fR. Input/output requests to the devices must follow the same restrictions as those for SCSI disks or tapes. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D) or \fBst\fR(7D).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBdkio\fR(7I) and \fBcdio\fR(7I).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D) for disks or \fBst\fR(7D) for tapes.
.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
The device special files for the USB mass storage device are created like those for a \fBSCSI\fR disk or SCSI tape. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D) or \fBst\fR(7D).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The Zip 100 drive does not comply with \fIUniversal Serial Bus Specification 1.0\fR and cannot be power managed. Power Management support for Zip 100 has been disabled. 
.sp
.LP
If the system panics while a UFS file system is mounted on the mass storage media, no syncing will take place for the disk mass-storage device. (Syncing is not supported by the \fBscsa2usb\fR driver.) As a result, the file system on the media will not be consistent on reboot.
.sp
.LP
If a PCFS file system is mounted, no syncing is needed and the filesystem will be consistent on reboot.
.sp
.LP
If a mass-storage device is busy, system suspend cannot proceed and the system will immediately resume again.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to remove a mass-storage device from the system will fail. The failure will be logged to the console. An attempt to replace the removed device with some other USB device will also fail. To successfully remove a USB mass-storage device you must "close" all references to it.
.sp
.LP
An Iomega Zip 100Mb disk cannot be formatted on an Iomega Zip250 drive. See the Iomega web site at \fIhttp://www.iomega.com\fR for details.
.sp
.LP
Concurrent I/O to devices with multiple LUNs on the same device is not supported.
.sp
.LP
Some USB CD-RW devices may perform inadequately at their advertised speeds. To compensate, use USB CD-RW devices at lower speeds (2X versus 4X). See \fBcdrw(1)\fR for details. 
.sp
.LP
This driver also supports CBI devices that do not use USB interrupt pipe for status completion.
