.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsprl\fR driver is a loadable \fBSTREAMS\fR and \fBUSBA\fR  (Solaris USB  architecture) compliant client driver that provides basic asynchronous communication support for Prolific PL2303 USB-to-serial converters. Supported devices include PL2303H, PL2303HX and PL2303X.  Serial device streams are built with appropriate modules that are pushed atop the \fBusbsprl\fR driver by the \fBautopush\fR(1M) facility.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsprl\fR module supports the \fBtermio\fR(7I) device control functions specified by flags in the \fBc_cflag\fR word of the termios structure, and by the IGNBRK,  IGNPAR,  PARMRK and INPCK flags in the \fBc_iflag\fR word of the termios structure. All other \fBtermio\fR(7I) functions must be performed by \fBSTREAMS\fR modules pushed atop the driver. When a device is opened, the \fBldterm\fR(7M) and \fBttcompat\fR(7M)  \fBSTREAMS\fR modules are automatically pushed on top of the stream, providing the standard \fBtermio\fR(7I) interface. 
.sp
.LP
Use device logical names \fB/dev/term/[0-9]\fR*  to  access  the serial ports. These names are typically used to provide a logical access point for a dial-in line that is used with a modem.
.sp
.LP
A special feature (controlled by the minor device number) is available that enables a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for incoming and outgoing calls. By accessing through device logical name \fB/dev/cua/[0-9]\fR*, you can open a port without  the carrier detect signal being asserted, either through hardware or an equivalent software mechanism. These devices are commonly known as  'dial-out' lines.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
A dial-in line can be opened only if the corresponding dial-out line is closed. A blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open waits until the \fB/dev/cua\fR line is closed (which drops Data Terminal Ready, after which Carrier Detect usually drops as well) and carrier is detected again.  A non-blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open returns an error if the \fB/dev/cua\fR is open. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB/dev/term\fR line is opened successfully  (usually  only when  carrier is recognized on the modem), the corresponding \fB/dev/cua\fR line cannot be opened. This allows a modem and port to be used  for dial-in (by enabling the line for login in \fB/etc/inittab\fR) or dial-out (by \fBtip\fR(1), or \fBuucp\fR(1C)) when no one is logged in on the line.
.sp
.LP
Device hot-removal  is functionally equivalent to a modem disconnect event, as defined in \fBtermio\fR(7I).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBusbsprl\fR driver supports the  standard set of \fBtermio\fR(7I) ioctl calls.
.sp
.LP
Input and output line speeds can be set to the following baud rates:  75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400 or 460800.  Input and output line speeds cannot be set independently. For example, when the output speed is set, the input speed is automatically set to the same speed.
