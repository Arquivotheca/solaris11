.SH NAME
scsa1394 \- SCSI to 1394 bridge driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBunit@GUID\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa1394\fR driver is a 1394 target and an SCSA HBA driver that supports 1394 mass storage devices compliant with the \fISerial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2\fR) specification. It supports both bus-powered and self-powered 1394 mass storage devices.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa1394\fR nexus driver maps SCSA target driver requests to SBP-2 Operation Request Blocks (\fBORB\fR's).
.sp
.LP
The \fBscsa1394\fR driver creates a child device info node for each logical unit (LUN) on the mass storage device. The standard Solaris SCSI disk driver is attached to those nodes. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
This driver supports multiple LUN devices and creates a separate child device info node for each LUN. All child LUN nodes attach to \fBsd\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
In previous releases, all 1394 mass storage devices were treated as removable media devices and managed by \fBrmformat\fR(1) and volume management software. In the current release, however, only mass storage devices with a removable bit (RMB) value of \fB1\fR are removable. (The RMB is part of the device's SCSI INQUIRY data.) See SCSI specifications T10/995D Revision 11a, T10/1236-D Revision 20 or T10/1416-D Revision 23 for more information. However, for backward compatibility, all 1394 mass storage devices can still be managed by \fBrmformat\fR(1). With or without a volume  manager,  you can mount, eject, hot remove and hot insert a  1394 mass storage device as the following sections explain. 
.SH USING VOLUME MANAGEMENT
.sp
.LP
Mass storage devices are managed by a volume manager. Software that manages removable media creates a device nickname that can be listed with \fBeject\fR(1) or \fBrmmount\fR(1). A device that is not mounted automatically can be mounted using \fBrmmount\fR(1) under \fB/rmdisk/\fIlabel\fR\fR. Note that the \fBmount\fR(1M) and \fBmount\fR(1M) commands do not accept nicknames; you must use explicit device names with these commands.
.sp
.LP
See \fBrmmount\fR(1) to unmount the device and \fBeject\fR(1) to eject the media. If the device is ejected while it is mounted, volume management software unmounts the device before ejecting it. It also might kill any active applications that are accessing the device.
.sp
.LP
Volume management software is hotplug-aware and normally mounts file systems on USB mass storage devices if the file system is recognized. Before hot removing the USB device, use \fBeject\fR(1) to unmount the file system. 
.sp
.LP
You can disable the automatic mounting and unmounting of removable devices by inserting a entry for a removable device in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. In this entry, you must set the \fBmount at boot\fR field to \fBno\fR. See \fBvfstab\fR(4). See the \fISystem Administration Guide, Volume I\fR.
.SH USING \fBmount\fR AND \fBumount\fR
.sp
.LP
Use \fBmount\fR(1M) to explicitly mount the device and \fBumount\fR(1M) to unmount the device. Use \fBeject\fR(1) to eject the media. After you have explicitly mounted a removable device, you cannot use a nickname as an argument to \fBeject\fR.
.sp
.LP
Removing the storage device while it is being accessed or mounted fails with a console warning. To hot remove the storage device from the system, unmount the file system, then kill all applications accessing the device. Next, hot remove the device. A storage device can be hot inserted at any time.
.sp
.LP
For a comprehensive listing of (non-bootable) 1394 mass-storage devices that are compatible with this driver, see \fBwww.sun.com/io\fR.
.SH DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
.sp
.LP
Block special file names are located in \fB/dev/dsk\fR. Raw file names are located in \fB/dev/rdsk\fR. Input/output requests to the devices must follow the same restrictions as those for SCSI disks. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBcdio\fR(7I) and \fBdkio\fR(7I).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D).
.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
The device special files for the 1394 mass storage device are created like those for a SCSI disk. Refer to \fBsd\fR(7D).
