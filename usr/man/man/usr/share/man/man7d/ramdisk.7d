.SH NAME
ramdisk \- RAM disk device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBramdisk@0:\fR\fIdiskname\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBramdisk\fR driver supports numerous ramdisk devices that are created by the system during the boot  process (see \fBboot\fR(1M)) or during normal system operation (see \fBramdiskadm\fR(1M) for more information).
.SH DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
.sp
.LP
Each ramdisk can be accessed either as a block device or as a raw device. When accessed as a block device, the normal buffering          mechanism is used when reading from and writing to the device, without regard to physical disk records. Accessing the ramdisk as a raw device enables direct transmission between the disk and the read or write buffer. A single read or write call usually results in a single  I/O operation, meaning that raw I/O is more efficient when many bytes are  transmitted. You can find block files names in \fB/dev/ramdisk\fR. Raw file names are found in \fB/dev/rramdisk\fR.
.sp
.LP
There are no alignment or length restrictions on I/O requests to either block or character devices.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The percentage of available physical memory that can be allocated to ramdisks is constrained by the variable \fBrd_percent_physmem\fR. You can tune the \fBrd_percent_physmem\fR variable in \fB/etc/system\fR. By default, the percentage of available physical memory that can be allocated to ramdisks is fixed at 25%.
.sp
.LP
A ramdisk may not be the best possible use of system memory. Accordingly, use ramdisks only when absolutely necessary.
