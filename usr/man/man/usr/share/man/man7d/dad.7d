dad \- driver for IDE disk devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdad@\fR \fItarget\fR,\fIlun\fR:\fIpartition\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This driver handles the ide disk drives on SPARC platforms. The type of disk drive is determined using the ATA IDE identify device command and by reading the volume label stored on the drive. The \fBdad\fR device driver supports the Solaris SPARC VTOC and the EFI/GPT disk volume labels.
.sp
.LP
The block-files access the disk using the system's normal buffering mechanism and are read and written without  regard to physical disk records. There is also a "raw" interface that provides for direct transmission between the disk and the user's read or write buffer.  A single read or write call usually results in one I/O operation; raw I/O is therefore considerably more efficient when many bytes are transmitted.  The names of the block files are found in \fB/dev/dsk\fR. Raw file names are found in  \fB/dev/rdsk\fR. 
.sp
.LP
I/O requests to the raw device must be aligned on a 512-byte (\fBDEV_BSIZE\fR) boundary and must have a length that is a multiple of 512 bytes. Requests that do not meet the restrictions cause the driver to return an \fBEINVAL\fR error. I/O requests to the block device have no alignment or length restrictions.
.SS "Device Statistics Support"
.sp
.LP
Each device maintains I/O statistics both for the device and for each partition allocated on that device. For each device/partition, the driver accumulates reads, writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The driver also takes  hi-resolution time stamps at queue entry and exit points, which facilitates monitoring the residence time and cumulative  residence-length product for each queue.
.sp
.LP
Each device also has error statistics associated with it. These must include counters for hard errors, soft errors and transport errors. Other data may be implemented as required.
