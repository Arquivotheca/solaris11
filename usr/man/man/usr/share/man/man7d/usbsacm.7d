.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsacm\fR driver is a loadable STREAMS and USBA (Solaris USB architecture)-compliant client driver that provides basic asynchronous communication support for USB modems and ISDN terminal adapters that conform to the \fIUniversal Serial Bus Communication Device Class Abstract Control Model (USB CDC ACM)\fR specification. You can download the \fIUSB CDC\fR specification from the USB website at \fIhttp://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbcdc11.pdf\fR. Supported devices include mobile phones and PCMCIA cards which provide modem function by the usb cable. Serial device streams are built with appropriate modules that are pushed atop the usbsacm driver by the \fBautopush\fR(1M) facility.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbsacm\fR module supports the \fBtermio\fR(7I) device control functions specified by flags in the c_cflag word of termios structure, and by the IGNBRK, IGNPAR, PARMRK and INPCK flags in the c_iflag word of the termios structure. All other \fBtermio\fR(7I) functions must be performed by STREAMS modules pushed atop the driver. When a device is opened, the \fBldterm\fR(7M) and \fBttcompat\fR(7M) STREAMS modules are automatically pushed on top of the stream, providing the standard \fBtermio\fR(7I) interface. 
.sp
.LP
You use device logical names /dev/term/[\fI0-9\fR]* to access the serial ports. These names are typically used to provide a logical access point for a dial-in line that is used with a modem. You can use \fBpppd\fR(1M) to transmit datagrams over these serial ports.
.sp
.LP
A special feature (controlled by the minor device number) is available that enables a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for incoming and outgoing calls. By accessing through device logical name /dev/cua/[\fI0-9\fR]*, you can open a port without the carrier detect signal being asserted, either through hardware or an equivalent software mechanism. These devices are commonly known  as 'dial-out' lines.
.sp
.LP
Unlike onboard serial ports, the \fBusbsacm\fR ports cannot serve as a local serial console.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
A dial-in line can  be  opened  only  if  the corresponding dial-out  line is closed. A blocking /dev/term open waits until the /dev/cua line is closed (which drops Data Terminal Ready, after which Carrier Detect usually drops as well) and carrier is detected again.  A non-blocking  /dev/term open returns an error if the /dev/cua is open. 
.sp
.LP
If the /dev/term line is opened successfully  (usually  only when  carrier is recognized on the modem), the corresponding      /dev/cua line cannot be opened. This allows a modem and port to  be  used  for dial-in (by enabling the line for login in \fB/etc/inittab\fR) or dial-out (by \fBtip\fR(1) or \fBuucp\fR(1C)) as \fB/dev/cua0\fR when no one is logged in on the line.
.sp
.LP
Device hot-removal  is functionally equivalent to a modem disconnect event, as defined in \fBtermio\fR(7I).
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBusbsacm\fR driver supports the standard set of \fBtermio\fR(7I) ioctl calls. 
.sp
.LP
The input and output line speeds may be set to any of the following baud rates: 75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400 or 460800. The speeds cannot be set independently. For example, when the output speed is set, the input speed is automatically set to the same speed.
