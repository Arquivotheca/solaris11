.nf
sound@unit-address
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusb_as\fR driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports the \fIUSB Audio Class 1.0\fR specification.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusb_as\fR driver processes audio data messages during play and record and sets sample frequency, precision, encoding and other functions on request from the USB audio control driver. See \fBusb_ac\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
This driver is plumbed under the USB audio control driver and does not directly interface with the user application.

\fBNo bandwidth available.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
There is no bandwidth available for the isochronous pipe. As a result, no data is transferred during play and record.

\fBOperating a full/high speed audio device on a high speed port is not supported.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The USB software does not currently support full or high speed audio devices connected to an external USB 2.0 hub that is linked to a port of a USB 2.0 host controller. Audio devices must be connected directly to a port of a USB 2.0 controller or to any USB 1.1 port.

.RS 4n
A USB audio streaming interface was hot-removed while open. A new device was hot-inserted which is not identical to the original USB audio device. Please disconnect the USB device and reconnect the device to the same port.
