.SH NAME
afe \- ADMtek Fast Ethernet device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/dev/afe\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBafe\fR driver is a multi-threaded,  loadable, clonable, GLD-based  STREAMS  driver supporting the Data Link Provider Interface \fBdlpi\fR(7P) on ADMtek (now Infineon) Centaur and Comet Fast Ethernet controllers.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
The \fBafe\fR driver can be used as either a \fBstyle 1\fR or a \fBstyle 2\fR Data Link Service Provider. Physical points of attachment (PPAs) are interpreted as the instance  number of the \fBafe\fR controller as assigned by the Solaris operating environment.
.sp

The relevant fields returned as part of a \fBDL_INFO_ACK\fR response are:
.RS +4

Maximum SDU is 1500.

If the SAP provided is zero, then \fIIEEE 802.3\fR mode is assumed and outbound frames will have the frame payload length written into the type field. Likewise, inbound frames with a SAP between zero and 1500 are interpreted as \fIIEEE 802.3\fR frames and delivered to any streams that are bound to SAP zero (the \fI802.3\fR SAP).
.SH PROPERTIES
.sp
.LP
The following properties  may  be  configured  using  either \fBndd\fR(1M) or the \fBafe.conf\fR configuration file as described by \fBdriver.conf\fR(4):
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables (default) or disables \fIIEEE 802.3u\fR auto-negotiation of link speed and duplex settings. If enabled, the device negotiates among the supported (and configured, see below) link options with the link partner.  If disabled, at least one of the link options below must be specified. The driver selects the first enabled link option according to the \fIIEEE 802.3u\fR specified preferences.  
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_100T4_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables the 100 BaseT4 link option.  (Note that most hardware does not support this unusual link style.  Also, this uses two pairs of wires for data, rather than one.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_100fdx_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables the 100 Base TX full-duplex link option. (This is generally the fastest mode if both link partners support it. Most modern equipment supports this mode.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_100hdx_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables the 100 Base TX half-duplex link option. (Typically used when the link partner is a 100 Mbps hub.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_10fdx_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables the 10 Base-T full-duplex link option.  (This less-frequently used mode is typically used when the link partner is a 10 Mbps switch.)  
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBadv_10hdx_cap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables the 10 Base-T half-duplex link option.  (This is the fall-back when no other option is available.  It is typically used when the link partner is a 10 Mbps hub or is an older network card.)
