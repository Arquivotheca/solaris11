.SH NAME
fcip \- IP/ARP over Fibre Channel datagram encapsulation driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/dev/fcip
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcip\fR driver is a Fibre Channel upper layer protocol module for encapsulating \fBIP\fR (IPv4) and \fBARP\fR datagrams over Fibre Channel. The \fBfcip\fR driver is  a  loadable,  clonable, \fBSTREAMS\fR driver supporting the connectionless Data Link Provider Interface, \fBdlpi\fR(7P) over any Sun Fibre Channel transport layer-compliant host adapter. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcip\fR driver complies with the \fIRFC 2625\fR specification for encapsulating IP/ARP datagrams over Fibre Channel, and allows encapsulation of IPv4 only, as specified in  \fIRFC 2625\fR. The \fBfcip\fR  driver interfaces with the \fBfp\fR(7d) Sun Fibre Channel port driver.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
The  cloning  character-special device \fB/dev/fcip\fR is  used to  access all Fibre Channel ports capable of  supporting \fBIP\fR/\fBARP\fR traffic on the system.
.SS "fcip and DLPI"
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcip\fR driver is a "style 2" Data Link Service Provider. All \fBM_PROTO\fR and \fBM_PCPROTO\fR type messages  are interpreted as \fBDLPI\fR primitives. Valid \fBDLPI\fR primitives are defined in \fB<sys/dlpi.h>\fR\&. Refer  to \fBdlpi\fR(7P) for  more information on \fBDLPI\fR primitives. 
.sp
.LP
An explicit \fBDL_ATTACH_REQ\fR message must be sent to  associate the opened stream with a  particular Fibre Channel port (ppa). The ppa ID is interpreted as an unsigned long data type and indicates the corresponding Fibre Channel port driver instance number. An error  (\fBDL_ERROR_ACK\fR) is  returned by the driver if the ppa field value does not correspond to a valid port driver instance number or if the Fibre Channel port is  not \fBONLINE\fR. Refer  to \fBfp\fR(7d) for more  details on the Fibre Channel port driver.

Once in \fBDL_ATTACHED\fR state, the user must send a \fBDL_BIND_REQ\fR to associate a particular \fBSAP\fR (Service Access Point) with the stream. The \fBfcip\fR driver \fBDLSAP\fR address format consists of the 6-byte physical address component followed immediately by the 2-byte  \fBSAP\fR component producing an 8-byte \fBDLSAP\fR address. Applications should not be programmed to use this implementation-specific  \fBDLSAP\fR address format, but use information returned in the \fBDL_INFO_ACK\fR primitive to compose and decompose \fBDLSAP\fR addresses. The \fBSAP\fR length, full \fBDLSAP\fR length, and  \fBSAP\fR/physical ordering  are included  within the \fBDL_INFO_ACK\fR. The physical address length is the full  \fBDLSAP\fR address length minus the \fBSAP\fR length. The  physical address  length can  also be  computed by issuing the \fBDL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ\fR primitive to obtain the current physical address associated with the stream. 
.sp
.LP
Once in the \fBDL_BOUND\fR state, the user can transmit frames on the fibre by sending \fBDL_UNITDATA_REQ\fR messages to  the  \fBfcip\fR driver. The  \fBfcip\fR driver will route  received frames up any of the open and  bound streams having a \fBSAP\fR which matches the received frame's  \fBSAP\fR type as \fBDL_UNITDATA_IND\fR messages. Received Fibre Channel frames are  duplicated and routed up multiple open streams if necessary. The \fBDLSAP\fR address contained  within the \fBDL_UNITDATA_REQ\fR and \fBDL_UNITDATA_IND\fR messages consists  of both the \fBSAP\fR (type) and physical address (WorldWideName) components.

In Fibre Channel, \fBmulticasting\fR is defined as an optional service for Fibre Channel classes three and six only. If required, the Fibre Channel broadcast service can be used for multicasting. The \fIRFC 2625\fR specification does not support \fBIP \fRmulticasting or promiscuous mode.
.SS "fcip Fibre Channel ELS"
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcip\fR driver will use the \fBFARP\fR Fibre Channel Extended  Link Service (\fBELS\fR), where supported, to resolve WorldWide Names (MAC address) to FC Port Identifiers(Port_ID). The \fBfcip\fR driver also supports InARP to resolve WorldWide Name and Port_ID to an IP address.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If you use a Fibre Channel adapter with two or more ports that each share a common Node WorldWideName, the \fBfcip\fR driver will likely attach to the first port on the adapter.  
.sp
.LP
\fIRFC 2625\fR requires that both source  and destination WorldWideNames have their 4 bit NAA identifiers set to binary '0001,' indicating that an IEEE 48-bit MAC address is contained in the lower 48 bits of the network address fields. For additional details, see the \fIRFC 2625\fR specification.
