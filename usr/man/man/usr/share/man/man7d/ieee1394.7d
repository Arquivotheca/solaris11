.SH NAME
ieee1394, firewire, 1394 \- Solaris IEEE-1394 Architecture
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
IEEE-1394 provides a means for interconnecting devices  in computer and  home entertainment systems. (The IEEE-1394 architecture is also known as Firewire, an Apple Computer trademark, and i.Link, a Sony trademark). The most common IEEE-1394 devices  are digital camcorders, mass-storage devices and cameras (including webcam-type devices). For more information on USB, refer to the 1394 Trade Association website at http://\fIwww.1394ta.org\fR.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture supports up to 63 hot-pluggable IEEE-1394 devices per IEEE-1394 bus. The maximum data transfer rate is 400 Mbits, depending on the capabilities of the attached device.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture supports devices implementing a number of different specifications. The basic behavior of the IEEE-1394 bus is described in the \fIIEEE 1394-1995\fR and \fIIEEE 1394a-2000\fR specifications.
.sp
.LP
IEEE-1394 host controllers implementing the 1394 Open Host Controller Interface specification are supported. Camcorders      implementing the \fIIEC 61883\fR and 1394 Trade Association AV/C specifications are supported. Mass-storage devices implementing the \fIANSI SBP-2\fR specification are supported. Digital cameras implementing the 1394 Trade Association 1394-based Digital Camera (IIDC) specification are supported.
.SH FILES

.LP
Listed below are drivers and modules which either utilize or are utilized by the Solaris IEEE-1394 architecture. Drivers in \fB/kernel/drv\fR are 32 bit drivers (only). Drivers in \fB/kernel/drv/sparcv9\fR or \fB/kernel/drv/amd64\fR are 64 bit drivers.
