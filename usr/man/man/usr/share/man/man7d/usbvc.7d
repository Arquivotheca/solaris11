.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbvc\fR driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture)-compliant client driver that supports the \fIUSB Device Class Definition for Video Devices\fR specification, Versions 1.0 and 1.1. The \fBusbvc\fR driver supports a subset  of the video controls and formats described in the USB specification.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbvc\fR driver also implements the Video4Linux2 API (\fIV4L2\fR), Version 0.20 for applications. For more information on the \fIV4L2 API\fR, visit \fIhttp://www.thedirks.org/v4l2\fR.
.sp
.LP
Note that the \fBusbvc\fR driver supports the video capture function only and that video output is not supported. For more information on supported USB video-class devices and functions, visit \fIhttp://www.sun.com/io\fR.
.SH READING DATA
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbvc\fR driver reads video data from the isochronous endpoint of the device. Bulk data endpoints are not supported.  
.sp
.LP
MJPEG and UNCOMPRESSED video formats are supported. Isochronous data are read from the isochronous  input  device frame-by-frame and are maintained in a buffer array within the driver. Video frames are read from the driver using the \fBread\fR(2) or \fBmmap\fR(2) I/O method. For \fBread\fR(2), each read returns a buffer of a video frame. For \fBmmap\fR(2), each \fBVIDIOC_DQBUF\fR ioctl returns the buffer structure v4l2_buffer. (A video frame buffer pointer is included in the structure). See the \fIV4L2 API\fR for buffer structure and other related data structure information.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
A brief overview of supported ioctl requests appears below. For more detailed information, refer to the \fIV4L2 API\fR document. Note: ioctl information presented in the \fIV4L2 API\fR document may differ slightly from the content of this manpage. In such cases, you should rely on the information in this manpage.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The USB video device will be power-managed when the device is idle.
.sp
.LP
If a USB video device is hot-removed while active, a console warning is displayed requesting you to put the device back in the same port and telling you of potential data loss. Hot-removal of an active video device is strongly discouraged.
.sp
.LP
Always close all applications before hot-removing or  hot-inserting a  device. If an application is open when a device is hot-removed, inserting the  device  in  a  different  port  will create new \fB/dev/video\fR\fIN\fR  links. Moving an active device to another port is not recommended.
