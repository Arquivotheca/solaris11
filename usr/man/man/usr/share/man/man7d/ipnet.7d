.SH NAME
ipnet, lo0 \- ipnet device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/dev/ipnet/*, /dev/lo0\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipnet\fR device driver creates, removes and manages nodes in the \fB/dev/ipnet/\fR namespace. 
.sp
.LP
A node is created in \fB/dev/ipnet\fR for every IP interface on the system, including interfaces that exist only in software and for which there is no hardware device. The \fBipnet\fR device also provides access to all IP traffic to and from the system. To provide access to packets that are internally looped-back in IP, the \fBipnet\fR driver creates a \fB/dev/lo0\fR DLPI device.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.SS "\fBipnet\fR and DLPI"
.sp
.LP
Device nodes created in \fB/dev/ipnet\fR are DLPI style-1 devices. All \fBM_PROTO\fR and \fBM_PCPROTO\fR-type messages are interpreted as DLPI primitives. Because the device is read-only and packets can only be observed by opening them, the following subset of DLPI primitives is supported:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
DL_INFO_REQ
DL_BIND_REQ
DL_UNBIND_REQ
DL_PROMISCON_REQ
DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ
DLIOCRAW

The \fB/dev/ipnet/*\fR and \fB/dev/lo0\fR devices only accept \fBDL_BIND_REQ\fR requests for SAPs 4 (IPv4 packets), 6 (IPv6 packets), or 0 (all IP packets). \fBDL_BIND_REQ\fR requests for other SAP values result in a \fBDL_ERROR_ACK\fR of \fBDL_BADSAP\fR. 
.SS "\fBipnet\fR Primitives"
.sp
.LP
For \fB/dev/ipnet/*\fR devices, the \fBDL_PROMISCON_REQ\fR and \fBDL_PROMISCOFF_REQ\fR primitives with the \fBDL_PROMISC_PHYS\fR flag set in the \fBdl_level\fR field enables/disables the reception of all packets. When disabled, only packets with addresses matching any of the configured addresses on the IP interface are received. When used with the \fBDL_PROMISC_MULTI\fR flag set, reception of all multicast group addresses can be enabled/disabled. \fBDL_PROMISC_PHYS\fR and \fBDL_PROMISC_MULTI\fR have no effect for \fB/dev/lo0\fR. When the \fBDL_PROMISC_SAP\fR flag is set, reception of all IPv4 and IPv6 can be enabled/disabled.
.sp
.LP
The \fBDLIOCRAW\fR ioctl is supported but has no effect on the data returned from the device.
.sp
.LP
The \fBDL_IOC_IPNET_INFO\fR ioctl enables/disables the inclusion of a \fBdl_ipnetinfo_t\fR structure that is prepended to the IP header when receiving packet data. When enabled, a non-zero integer is returned reflecting the current \fBDL_IOC_IPNET_INFO\fR version. The \fBdl_ipnetinfo_t\fR data structure is defined in \fB<sys/dlpi.h>\fR and includes the following fields:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uint8_t         dli_version;    /* DL_IPNETINFO_* version */
uint8_t         dli_family;     /* packet IP header version */
uint16_t        dli_htype;
uint32_t        dli_pktlen;     /* length of dl_ipnetinfo_t */
uint32_t        dli_ifindex;
uint32_t        dli_grifindex;
uint32_t        dli_zsrc;       /* packet source zone ID (if any) */
uint32_t        dli_zdst;       /* packet dest zone ID (if any) */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The current \fBdli_version\fR is 1. To robustly support future \fBdl_ipnetinfo_t\fR versions, consumers should check that \fBdli_version\fR is a value they recognize, and must use the \fBdli_len\fR field to advance past the \fBdl_ipnetinfo_t\fR header.
