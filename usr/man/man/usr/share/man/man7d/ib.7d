.SH NAME
ib \- InfiniBand Bus Nexus Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBib\fR (IB nexus) driver is a pseudo nexus driver that supports enumeration of port devices, VPPA (Virtual Physical Point Attachment), HCA_SVC (HCA  Service) devices, and I/O controllers (IOC) on the InfiniBand fabric that are visible to the host and provides interfaces to \fBcfgadm_ib\fR(1M) to manage hot-plugging of IB devices. The \fBib\fR nexus driver enumerates the port device, VPPA devices and HCA_SVC devices based on entries specified in the \fBib.conf\fR file. IOC devices are enumerated on demand. The IB  nexus driver uses InfiniBand Device Manager services (\fBibdm\fR(7D)) to enumerate port devices, VPPA devices, HCA_SVC devices, and IOCs on the IB fabric.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
You configure the \fBib\fR driver by defining properties in the \fBib.conf\fR file. The IB nexus driver supports the following properties:

.TE

.sp
.LP
The \fBport-svc-list\fR property defines the list of port communication service names per port. The IB nexus driver creates a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (\fBHCA\fR) port. The \fBib.conf\fR file contains a \fBport-svc-list=""\fR entry by default. You update \fBport-svc-list\fR with service names you want to add to the system.
.sp
.LP
The \fBvppa-svc-list\fR property defines the list of \fBVPPA\fR communication service names per port per partition key. The IB nexus driver creates a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (\fBHCA\fR) port. The \fBib.conf\fR file contains a \fBvppa-svc-list=""\fR entry by default. You update \fBvppa-svc-list\fR with service names you want to add to the system.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhca-svc-list\fR property defines the list of HCA_SVC communication service names per HCA. The IB nexus driver creates a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (HCA). The \fBib.conf\fR file contains a \fBhca-svc-list=""\fR  entry by  default. You update \fBhca-svc-list\fR with service names you want to add to the system.
.sp
.LP
The service name specified in \fBport-svc-list\fR, \fBvppa-svc-list\fR and \fBhca-svc-list\fR must be  unique, be a maximum of four characters long, and is limited to digits 0-9 and letters a-z and A-Z.
.sp
.LP
IOC drivers (which are parented by the IB nexus driver) may themselves have .conf files. To distinguish those cases from pseudo drivers parented by IB  nexus, such drivers should include the \fB"ib-node-type"\fR property with value \fBmerge\fR in the IOC \fBdriver.conf\fR file. That property ensures that properties from the .conf file are merged with other properties found through hardware probing.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Example 1: A sample \fBib.conf\fR file with one  service name entry for PORT     communication services.

    port-svc-list="" 
    vppa-svc-list="";
    hca-svc-list="";
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
In Example 1, the IB nexus driver does not create any port/vppa/hca_svc device instances.
.sp
.LP
Example 2: A sample \fBib.conf\fR file with one entry for \fB"srv"\fR service:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   
   port-svc-list="srv" 
   vppa-svc-list="";
   hca-svc-list="";
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The IB nexus driver creates one \fBsrv\fR service instance for every \fBHCA\fR port that exists on the host. For example, if there are two \fBHCA\fRs, each with two ports on the host, the IB nexus driver creates four instances of the \fBsrv\fR service.
.sp
.LP
Example 3: A sample \fBib.conf\fR file with one  service name entry for     each of Port and VPPA  communication services:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   
   port-svc-list="srv" 
   vppa-svc-list="ipib";
   hca-svc-list="";
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If there are two \fBHCA\fRs in the system with two ports each and each port has two  valid PKEY values, the IB  nexus driver creates four instances of  srv service (one for each port).  It also creates eight instances of \fBipd\fR service (one per each port/PKEY combination).
.sp
.LP
Example 4: A sample \fBib.conf\fR file with one service name entry for     each of Port, VPPA and HCA_SVC communication services:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   
   port-svc-list="srv";
   vppa-svc-list="ipib";
   hca-svc-list="hca_nfs";
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The IB nexus driver creates one instance of hca_nfs service for each HCA in the system.
