.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/dev/mem\fR is a special file that provides access to the physical memory of the computer. 
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/dev/kmem\fR is a special file that provides access to the virtual address space of the operating system kernel, excluding memory that is associated with an I/O device. 
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/dev/allkmem\fR is a special file that provides access to the virtual address space of the operating system kernel, including memory that is associated with an I/O device.  You can use any of these devices to examine and modify the system.
.sp
.LP
Byte addresses in \fB/dev/mem\fR are interpreted as physical memory addresses. Byte addresses in \fB/dev/kmem\fR and \fB/dev/allkmem\fR are interpreted as kernel virtual memory addresses. A reference to a non-existent location returns an error. See ERRORS for more information.
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/dev/mem\fR accesses physical memory; the size of the file is equal to the amount of physical memory in the computer. This size may be larger than 4GB on a system running the 32-bit operating environment. In this case, you can access memory beyond 4GB using a series of \fBread\fR(2) and \fBwrite\fR(2) calls, a \fBpread64()\fR or \fBpwrite64()\fR call, or a combination of \fBllseek\fR(2) and \fBread\fR(2) or \fBwrite\fR(2).

Occurs when trying to  \fBwrite\fR(2) a read-only location (\fBallkmem\fR), \fBread\fR(2) a write-only location (\fBallkmem\fR), or \fBread\fR(2) or \fBwrite\fR(2) a non-existent or unimplemented location (\fBmem\fR, \fBkmem\fR, \fBallkmem\fR).

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
Using these devices to modify (that is, write to) the address space of a live running operating system or to modify the state of      a hardware device is extremely dangerous and may result in a system panic if kernel data structures are damaged or if device state is changed.
