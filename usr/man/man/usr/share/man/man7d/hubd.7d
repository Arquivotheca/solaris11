.SH NAME
hubd \- USB hub driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBhub@unit-address\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhubd\fR is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports USB hubs conforming to the \fIUniversal Serial Bus Specification 2.0\fR. The \fBhubd\fR driver supports bus-powered and self-powered hubs. The driver supports hubs with individual port power, ganged power and no power switching.
.sp
.LP
When a device is attached to a hub port, the \fBhubd\fR driver enumerates the device by determining its type and assigning an address to it. For multi-configuration devices, \fBhubd\fR sets the preferred configuration (refer to \fBcfgadm_usb\fR(1M) to select a configuration). The \fBhubd\fR driver attaches a driver to the device if one is available for the default or selected configuration. When the device is disconnected from the hub port, the \fBhubd\fR driver offlines any driver instance attached to the device.

In addition to being logged, the following messages may also appear on the system console. Messages are formatted in the following manner: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
WARNING: <device path> <hubd<instance number>): Message...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fB<instance number>\fR is the instance number of \fBhubd\fR and \fB<device path>\fR is the physical path to the device in \fB/devices\fR directory. Messages from the root hub are displayed with a \fBusb<instance number>\fR prefix instead of \fBhub<instance number>\fR as the root hub is an integrated part of the host controller.

\fBConnecting device on port \fI<number>\fR failed.\fR

.RS 4n
The driver failed to enumerate the device connected on port \fI<number>\fR of hub. If enumeration fails, disconnect and re-connect.

\fBUse of a USB 1.0 hub behind a high speed port may cause unexpected failures.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Devices connected to a USB 1.0 hub which are in turn connected to an external USB 2.0 hub, may misbehave unexpectedly or suddenly go offline. This is due to a documented incompatibility between USB 1.0 hubs and USB 2.0 hub Transaction Translators. Please use only USB 2.0 or USB 1.1 hubs behind high-speed ports.
.RE

\fBConnecting a high speed device to a non-high speed hub (port x) will result in a loss of performance. Please connect the device to a high speed port to get the maximum performance.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
USB 2.0 devices connected to USB 1.0 or 1.1 hubs cannot run at their highest speed, even when the hub is in turn connected to a high-speed port. For best performance, reconnect without going through a USB 1.0 or 1.1 hub.
.RE

\fBCannot access <device>. Please reconnect.\fR
.ad

This hub has been disconnected because a device other than the original one has been inserted. The driver informs you of this fact by displaying the name of the original device.

\fBDevices not identical to the previous one on this port. Please disconnect and reconnect.\fR

Same condition as described above; however in this case, the driver is unable to identify the original device with a name string.

.RS 4n
The current hub driver supports hubs that have \fI<n>\fR ports or less. A hub with more than \fI<n>\fR ports has been plugged in. Only the first \fI<n>\fR out of the total \fI<number of physical ports>\fR ports are usable.

\fBHub global over current condition, please disconnect the devices connected to the hub to clear the condition. You may need to re-connect the hub if the ports do not work.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An overcurrent condition was detected on the hub. This 	means that the aggregate current being drawn by the devices on the downstream ports exceeds a preset value. Refer to section 7.2.1.2 and 11.13 of the \fIUniversal Serial Bus Specification 2.0\fR. If this message continues to display, you may need to remove downstream devices to eliminate the problem. If any port does not work after the overcurrent condition is cleared, re-connect the hub to re-enable the ports.

\fBRoot hub over current condition, please check your system to clear the condition as soon as possible. You may need to reboot the system if the root hub does not recover automatically.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An overcurrent condition was detected on the root hub, indicating that malfunctioning devices on the downstream ports are drawing too much current. Please disconnect the problematic downstream devices to eliminate the problem. If the root hub doesn't work after the overcurrent condition is cleared, you may need to reboot the system.

\fBPort <\fIn\fR> in over current condition, please check the attached device to clear the condition. The system will try to recover the port, but if not successful, you need to re-connect the hub or reboot the system to bring the port back to work.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An overcurrent condition was detected on port <\fIn\fR>. This means the device connected to the port is drawing more current than the hub can supply. If this message continues to display, please disconnect the device to eliminate the problem. If the port doesn't work after the overcurrent condition is cleared, please re-connect the hub or reboot the system to enable the port again.
