.SH NAME
hermon \- ConnectX MT25408/MT25418/MT25428 InfiniBand (IB) Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhermon\fR driver is an IB Architecture-compliant implementation of an HCA, which operates on the Mellanox MT25408,  MT25418 and MT25428 InfiniBand ASSPs using host memory for context storage  rather than  locally  attached memory on the card. Cards based  on these ASSP's utilize the PCI-Express I/O  bus. These  ASSP's  support  the  link and physical layers of the InfiniBand specification while  the ASSP and the driver support the transport layer.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhermon\fR driver interfaces with  the InfiniBand  Transport Framework (IBTF) and provides an implementation of the Channel Interfaces that are defined by that framework.  It  also enables  management applications and agents to access the IB fabric.

\fBhermon\fBi\fR: driver attached for maintenance mode only.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
There was a failure in the boot  process of  the  hermon ASSP  and  the only function that can be performed is to re-flash  firmware on the ASSP. (\fBi\fR represents  the instance of the hermon device number.)

\fBhermon\fBi:\fR driver failed to attach\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The ASSP could not boot into either  operational  (HCA) mode or into maintenance mode. The device is inoperable. (\fBI\fR represents  the instance of the hermon device number.)
