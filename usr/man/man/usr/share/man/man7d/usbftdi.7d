usbftdi \- FTDI USB to serial converter driver
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBusbftdi@unit\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbftdi\fR driver is a loadable STREAMS and USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that provides basic asynchronous communication support for FTDI USB-to-serial converters. Serial device streams are built with appropriate modules that are pushed atop the \fBusbftdi\fR driver by the \fBautopush\fR(1M) facility.
.SS "Application Programming Interface"
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbftdi\fR module supports the \fBtermio\fR(7I) device control functions specified by flags in the \fBc_cflag\fR word of the \fBtermios\fR structure, and by the \fBIGNBRK, IGNPAR, PARMRK\fR, and \fBINPCK\fR flags in the \fBc_iflag\fR word of the \fBtermios\fR structure. All other \fBtermio\fR(7I) functions must be performed by STREAMS modules pushed atop the driver. When a device is opened, the , \fBldterm\fR(7M) and \fBttcompat\fR(7M) STREAMS modules are automatically pushed on top of the stream, providing the standard \fBtermio\fR(7I) interface.
.sp
.LP
Use device logical names \fB/dev/term/[0-9]*\fR to access the serial ports for a dial-in line that is used with a modem. 
.sp
.LP
Use device logical names \fB/dev/cua/[0-9]*\fR to access the serial ports for other applications. These names are also used to provide a logical access point for a dial-out line.
.sp
.LP
Device hot-removal is functionally equivalent to a modem disconnect event, as defined in \fBtermio\fR(7I). 
.sp
.LP
Input and output line speeds can be set to the following baud rates: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800 or 921600. Input and output line speeds can not be set independently. For example, when the output speed is set, the input speed is automatically set to the same speed.
.SS "Soft Carrier Capabilities"
.sp
.LP
Many devices that use this USB serial interface component are not, in fact dial-in lines connected to carefully configured RS-232 modems. They are often intelligent peripherals whose manufacturers want to present a serial port interface to application software. Some applications use only three wire connections, or are otherwise somewhat casual about the state of the Carrier Detect (electrical) signal, and the other modem control lines. 
.sp
.LP
The configuration file delivered with this driver, \fBusbftdi.conf\fR, acknowledges this by setting the driver property \fBignore-cd\fR to 1. This enables \fBsoft carrier\fR mode where the kernel does \fBnot\fR block opens waiting for DCD to be asserted.
.sp
.LP
This behavior also matches the default \fBignore carrier detect\fR behavior of the onboard serial ports of machines that have them. See \fBeeprom\fR(1M) for further details. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBhardware carrier\fR behavior (the driver's internal default) can be selected by either unsetting (commenting out) the \fBignore-cd\fR property, or by setting the value of the property to zero. 
.sp
.LP
More sophisticated selection of which devicesl ignore or obey the DCD signal can be effected using \fBport-%d-ignore-cd\fR properties.
.SS "Dial-In and Dial-Out Support"
.sp
.LP
A related feature is available for traditional usage that enables a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for incoming and outgoing calls. By accessing through device logical name \fB/dev/cua/[0-9]*\fR, you can open a port without the carrier detect signal being asserted, either through hardware or an equivalent software mechanism. These devices are commonly known as dial-out lines. 
.sp
.LP
A dial-in line can be opened only if the corresponding dial-out line is closed. A blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open waits until the \fB/dev/cua\fR line is closed, which drops Data Terminal Ready, after which Carrier Detect usually drops as well.  When the carrier is detected again with the \fB/dev/cua\fR device remaining closed, this indicates an incoming call and the blocking open seizes exclusive use of the line. 
.sp
.LP
A non-blocking \fB/dev/term\fR open returns an error if the \fB/dev/cua\fR device is open.  
.sp
.LP
If the \fB/dev/term\fR line is opened successfully (usually only when carrier is recognized on the modem, though see \fBSoft Carrier Capabilities\fR section of this manual page), the corresponding \fB/dev/cua\fR line can not be opened. This allows a modem and port to be used for dial-in (enabling the line for login in \fB/etc/inittab\fR) or dial-out (using \fBtip\fR(1) or \fBuucp\fR(1C)) when no-one is logged in on the line.
