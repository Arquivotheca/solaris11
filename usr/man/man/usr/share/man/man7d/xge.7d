.SH NAME
xge \- Neterion Xframe 10Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/dev/xge
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBxge\fR 10 Gigabit Ethernet  driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver supporting  the Data Link Provider Interface, \fBdlpi\fR(7P), on S2IO Xframe 10-Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter.
.sp
.LP
The \fBxge\fR driver functions includes controller initialization, frame transmit and receive, promiscuous and multicast support, TCP and UDP checksum offload (IPv4 and IPv6), 9622-byte jumbo frame, and error recovery and reporting.
.sp
.LP
The \fBxge\fR driver and hardware support the 10GBase-SR/W, LR/W, and ER/W \fI802.3\fR physical layer.
.SH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
.sp
.LP
The cloning,  character-special device \fB/dev/xge\fR is used to access all Xframe devices installed within the system.
.sp
.LP
The \fBxge\fR driver is managed by the \fBdladm\fR(1M) command line utility, which allows VLANs to be defined on top of xge  instances and for \fBxge\fR instances to be aggregated. See \fBdladm\fR(1M) for more details.
.sp
.LP
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to the DL_INFO_REQ are as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Maximum SDU is \fB9600\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Minimum SDU is \fB0\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBDSLAP\fR address length is \fB8\fR bytes.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBMAC\fR type is \fBDL_ETHER.\fR 
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBSAP\fR length value is  -2 meaning the physical address component is followed immediately by a 2-byte sap component within the DLSAP address.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Broadcast address value is Ethernet/IEEE  broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
By default, the \fBxge\fR driver works without any configuration file.
.sp
.LP
You can check the running-time status of a device  instance using \fBndd\fR(1M). Currently, the driver provides an interface to print all hardware statistics.
.sp
.LP
For example, to print statistics of device xge0:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
     #ndd /dev/xge0 stats
     tmac_data_octets 772
     tmac_frms 15
     tmac_drop_frms 0
     tmac_bcst_frms 6
     tmac_mcst_frms 6

     ...

     rmac_vld_frms 13
     rmac_fcs_err_frms 0
     rmac_drop_frms 0
     rmac_vld_bcst_frms 7
     rmac_vld_mcst_frms 11
     rmac_out_rng_len_err_frms 0
     rmac_in_rng_len_err_frms 0
     rmac_long_frms 0
