.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhid\fR driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports the \fIHuman Interface Device Class (HID) 1.0\fR specification. The Human Interface Device (HID) class encompasses devices controlled by humans to operate computer systems. Typical examples of HID devices include keyboards, mice, trackballs, and joysticks. HID also covers front-panel controls such as knobs, switches, and buttons. A USB device with multiple interfaces may have one interface for audio and a HID interface to define the buttons that control the audio.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhid\fR driver is general and primarily handles the USB functionality of the device and generic HID functionality. For example, HID interfaces are required to have an interrupt pipe for the device to send data packets, and the \fBhid\fR driver opens the pipe to the interrupt endpoint and starts polling. The \fBhid\fR driver is also responsible for managing the device through the default control pipe. In addition to being a USB client driver, the \fBhid\fR driver is also a STREAMS driver so that modules may be pushed on top of it.
.sp
.LP
The HID specification is flexible, and HID devices dynamically describe their packets and other parameters through a HID report descriptor. The HID parser is a misc module that parses the HID report descriptor and creates a database of information about the device. The \fBhid\fR driver queries the HID parser to find out the type and characteristics of the HID device. The HID specification predefines packet formats for the boot protocol keyboard and mouse.
.SH IOCTLS

.ne 2

.na
\fB\fBHIDIOCKMGDIRECT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
This ioctl should only be addressed to a USB keyboard or mouse device. The \fBhid\fR driver maintains two streams for each USB keyboard/mouse instance: an internal one for the use of the kernel and an external one for the use of user applications. This ioctl returns the information of which stream gets the input for the moment. 
.sp
\fIarg\fR must point to a variable of \fBint\fR type. Upon return, \fB0\fR means the internal stream gets the input, \fB1\fR means the external stream gets the input.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The hid driver currently supports only keyboard, mouse and audio HID control devices.
.sp
.LP
Normally a mouse is not power managed and consquently, screen darkening can be undone with a mouse movement. If power management of the mouse is required, add the following line to \fBhid.conf\fR then reboot the system:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
hid-mouse-pm-enable;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Modern mice that are power managed require a 'click' to wake up. Occasionally, this may cause unexpected results.
