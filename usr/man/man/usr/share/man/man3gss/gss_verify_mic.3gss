.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_verify_mic()\fR function verifies that a cryptographic \fBMIC\fR, contained in the token parameter, fits the supplied message. The \fIqop_state\fR parameter allows a message recipient to determine the strength of protection that was applied to the message.
.sp
.LP
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by \fBgss_wrap\fR(3GSS) to provide secure framing, the \fBGSS-API\fR supports the calculation and verification of \fBMIC\fRs over zero-length messages.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The token failed consistency checks.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_BAD_SIG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The \fBMIC\fR was incorrect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but it had already been processed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_OLD_TOKEN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but it is too old to check for duplication.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but it has been verified out of sequence; a later token has already been received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_GAP_TOKEN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The token was valid and contained a correct \fBMIC\fR for the message, but it has been verified out of sequence; an earlier expected token has not yet been received.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.
