.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_process_context_token()\fR function provides a way to pass an asynchronous token to the security service. Most context-level tokens are emitted and processed synchronously by \fBgss_init_sec_context()\fR and \fBgss_accept_sec_context()\fR, and the application is informed as to whether further tokens are expected by the \fBGSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED\fR major status bit. Occasionally, a mechanism might need to emit a context-level token at a point when the peer entity is not expecting a token. For example, the initiator's final call to \fBgss_init_sec_context()\fR may emit a token and return a status of \fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR, but the acceptor's call to \fBgss_accept_sec_context()\fR might fail. The acceptor's mechanism might want to send a token containing an error indication to the initiator, but the initiator is not expecting a token at this point, believing that the context is fully established. \fBgss_process_context_token()\fR provides a way to pass such a token to the mechanism at any time.
.sp
.LP
This function is provided for compatibility with the \fBGSS-API\fR version 1. Because \fBgss_delete_sec_context()\fR no longer returns a valid \fIoutput_token\fR to be sent to \fBgss_process_context_token()\fR, applications using a newer version of the \fBGSS-API\fR do not need to rely on this function.
