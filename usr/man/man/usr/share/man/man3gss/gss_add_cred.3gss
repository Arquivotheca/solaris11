.RS 22n
.rt  
Flag that indicates how a credential is used to initiate or accept security credentials. If the flag is \fBGSS_C_ACCEPT\fR, the credentials are used only to accept security credentials.

\fB\fIinitiator_time_req\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Number of seconds that the credential may remain valid for initiating security contexts. This argument is ignored if the composed credentials are of the \fBGSS_C_ACCEPT\fR type. Specify \fBGSS_C_INDEFINITE\fR to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.
.RE

Number of seconds that the credential may remain valid for accepting security contexts. This argument is ignored if the composed credentials are of the \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR type. Specify \fBGSS_C_INDEFINITE\fR to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.

Returned credential handle that contains the new credential-element and all the credential-elements from \fIinput_cred_handle\fR. If a valid pointer to a \fBgss_cred_id_t\fR is supplied for this parameter, \fBgss_add_cred()\fR creates a new credential handle that contains all credential-elements from \fIinput_cred_handle\fR and the newly acquired credential-element. If \fBNULL\fR is specified for this parameter, the newly acquired credential-element is added to the credential identified by \fIinput_cred_handle\fR.

Complete set of mechanisms for which the new credential is valid. Storage for the returned \fBOID\fR-set must be freed by the application after use by a call to \fBgss_release_oid_set\fR(3GSS). Specify \fBNULL\fR if this parameter is not required.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_add_cred()\fR function adds a credential-element to a credential. The credential-element is identified by the name of the principal to which it refers. This function is not intended as a function to login to the network. A function for login to the network would involve creating new mechanism-specific authentication data, rather than acquiring a handle to existing data.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIdesired_name\fR is \fBGSS_C_NO_NAME\fR, the call is interpreted as a request to add a credential-element to invoke default behavior when passed to \fBgss_init_sec_context\fR(3GSS) if the value of \fIcred_usage\fR is \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR. The call is also interpreted as a request to add a credential-element to the invoke default behavior when passed to \fBgss_accept_sec_context\fR(3GSS) if the value of \fIcred_usage\fR is \fBGSS_C_ACCEPT\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_add_cred()\fR function is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors. The \fBGSS-API\fR provides mechanism-specific ways to obtain \fBGSS-API\fR initiator credentials through the system login process. Consequently, the \fBGSS-API\fR does not support acquiring \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR credentials by means of \fBgss_acquire_cred\fR(3GSS) for any name other than the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBGSS_C_NO_NAME\fR
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Name produced by \fBgss_inquire_cred\fR(3GSS) applied to a valid credential
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Name produced by \fBgss_inquire_context\fR(3GSS) applied to an active context
.RE
.sp
.LP
If credential acquisition is time consuming for a mechanism, the mechanism can choose to delay the actual acquisition until the credential is required by \fBgss_init_sec_context\fR(3GSS), for example, or by \fBgss_accept_sec_context\fR(3GSS). Such mechanism-specific implementation decisions are invisible to the calling application. A call to \fBgss_inquire_cred\fR(3GSS) immediately following the call \fBgss_add_cred()\fR returns valid credential data as well as incurring the overhead of deferred credential acquisition.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_add_cred()\fR function can be used either to compose a new credential that contains all credential-elements of the original in addition to the newly-acquired credential-element. The function can also be used to add the new credential-element to an existing credential. If the value of the \fIoutput_cred_handle\fR parameter is \fBNULL\fR, the new credential-element is added to the credential identified by \fIinput_cred_handle\fR. If a valid pointer is specified for the \fIoutput_cred_handle\fR parameter, a new credential handle is created.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIinput_cred_handle\fR is \fBGSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL\fR, the \fBgss_add_cred()\fR function composes a credential and sets the \fIoutput_cred_handle\fR parameter based on the default behavior. The call has the same effect as a call first made by the application to \fBgss_acquire_cred\fR(3GSS) to specify the same usage and to pass \fBGSS_C_NO_NAME\fR as the \fIdesired_name\fR parameter. Such an application call obtains an explicit credential handle that incorporates the default behaviors, then passes the credential handle to \fBgss_add_cred()\fR, and finally calls \fBgss_release_cred\fR(3GSS) on the first credential handle.
.sp
.LP
If the value of the \fIinput_cred_handle\fR parameter is \fBGSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL\fR, a non-\fBNULL\fR value must be supplied for the \fIoutput_cred_handle\fR parameter.
