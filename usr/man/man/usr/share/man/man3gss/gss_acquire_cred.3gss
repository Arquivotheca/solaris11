.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_acquire_cred()\fR function allows an application to acquire a handle for a pre-existing credential by name. This routine is not intended as a function to login to the network; a function for login to the network would involve creating new credentials rather than merely acquiring a handle to existing credentials.
.sp
.LP
If \fIdesired_name\fR is \fBGSS_C_NO_NAME\fR, the call is interpreted as a request for a credential handle that will invoke default behavior when passed to \fBgss_init_sec_context\fR(3GSS) (if \fIcred_usage\fR is \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR) or \fBgss_accept_sec_context\fR(3GSS) (if \fIcred_usage\fR is \fBGSS_C_ACCEPT\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR). 
.sp
.LP
Normally \fBgss_acquire_cred()\fR returns a credential that is valid only for the mechanisms requested by the \fIdesired_mechs\fR argument. However, if multiple mechanisms can share a single credential element, the function returns all the mechanisms for which the credential is valid in the \fIactual_mechs\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
\fBgss_acquire_cred()\fR is intended to be used primarily by context  acceptors, since the \fBGSS-API\fR routines obtain initiator credentials through the system login process. Accordingly, you may not acquire \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR credentials by means of \fBgss_acquire_cred()\fR for any name other than \fBGSS_C_NO_NAME\fR. Alternatively, you may acquire \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR or \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR credentials for a name produced when \fBgss_inquire_cred\fR(3GSS) is applied to a valid credential, or when \fBgss_inquire_context\fR(3GSS) is applied to an active context. 
.sp
.LP
If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the credential is required, for example, by \fBgss_init_sec_context\fR(3GSS) or by \fBgss_accept_sec_context\fR(3GSS).  Such mechanism-specific implementations are, however, invisible to the calling application; thus a call of \fBgss_inquire_cred\fR(3GSS) immediately following the call of \fBgss_acquire_cred()\fR will return valid credential data and incur the overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.

\fB\fIdesired_name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The name of the principal for which a credential should be acquired.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItime_req\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The number of seconds that credentials remain valid. Specify \fBGSS_C_INDEFINITE\fR  to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdesired_mechs\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The set of underlying security mechanisms that may be used.  \fBGSS_C_NO_OID_SET\fR may be used to obtain a default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcred_usage\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
A flag that indicates how this credential should be used. If the flag is \fBGSS_C_ACCEPT\fR, then credentials will be used only to accept security credentials. \fBGSS_C_INITIATE\fR indicates that credentials will be used only to initiate security credentials. If the flag is \fBGSS_C_BOTH\fR, then credentials may be used either to initiate or accept security contexts. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIoutput_cred_handle\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The returned credential handle.  Resources associated with this credential handle must be released by the application after use with a call to \fBgss_release_cred\fR(3GSS)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIactual_mechs\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The set of mechanisms for which the credential is valid.  Storage associated with the returned \fBOID\fR-set must be released by the application after use with a call to  \fBgss_release_oid_set\fR(3GSS).  Specify \fBNULL\fR if not required.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItime_rec\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt

.na
\fB\fIminor_status\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
