Solaris architecture specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH PARAMETERS

\fB\fIap\fR \fR

.RS 10n

Pointer to the \fBscsi_address\fR(9S) structure.

\fB\fIlevel\fR \fR

.rt  
The level of reset required.
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_reset()\fR vector in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure must be initialized during the \fBHBA\fR driver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to an \fBHBA\fR entry point to be called when a target driver calls \fBscsi_reset\fR(9F). 
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_reset()\fR must reset either the \fBSCSI\fR bus, a \fBSCSI\fR target device, or a \fBSCSI\fR logical unit as specified by \fIlevel\fR. 
.sp
.LP
\fIlevel\fR must be one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBRESET_ALL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Reset the \fBSCSI\fR bus.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBRESET_TARGET\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Reset the target specified by \fIap\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBRESET_LUN\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Reset the logical unit specified by \fIap\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fBtran_reset\fR should set the \fBpkt_reason\fR field of all outstanding packets in the transport layer associated with each target or logical unit that was successfully reset to \fBCMD_RESET\fR and the \fBpkt_statistics\fR field must be \fBOR\fR'ed with either \fBSTAT_BUS_RESET\fR (if the SCSI bus was reset) or \fBSTAT_DEV_RESET\fR (if the target or logical unit was reset). 
.sp
.LP
The \fBHBA\fR driver should use a \fBSCSI\fR Bus Device Reset Message to reset a target device. The HBA driver should use a  SCSI Logical Unit Reset Message to reset a logical unit.
.sp
.LP
Packets that are in the transport layer but not yet active on the bus should be returned with \fBpkt_reason\fR set to \fBCMD_RESET\fR and \fBpkt_statistics\fR \fBOR\fR'ed with \fBSTAT_ABORTED\fR.
.sp
.LP
Support for \fBRESET_LUN\fR is optional but strongly encouraged for new and updated HBA drivers. If an HBA driver provides \fBRESET_LUN\fR support, it must also create the \fBlun-reset\fR capability with a value of zero for each target device instance represented by a valid \fIap\fR. The HBA is also required to provide the means to return the current value of the \fBlun-reset\fR capability in its \fBtran_getcap\fR(9E) routine, as well as the means to change the value of the \fBlun_reset\fR capability in its \fBtran_getcap\fR(9E) routine.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_reset()\fR should return:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
on success.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB0\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
on failure.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_reset()\fR function can be called from user or interrupt context. This requirement comes from \fBscsi_reset()\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If \fBpkt_reason\fR already indicates that an earlier error had occurred for a particular \fIpkt\fR, \fBtran_reset()\fR should not overwrite \fBpkt_reason\fR with \fBCMD_RESET\fR.
