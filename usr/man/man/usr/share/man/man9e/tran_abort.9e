.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_abort()\fR vector in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure must be initialized during the HBA driver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to an HBA entry point to be called when a target driver calls \fBscsi_abort\fR(9F). 
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_abort()\fR should attempt to abort the command \fIpkt\fR that has been transported to the HBA.  If \fIpkt\fR is \fBNULL\fR, the HBA driver should attempt to abort all outstanding packets for the target/logical unit addressed by \fIap\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Depending on the state of a particular command in the transport layer, the HBA driver may not be able to abort the command.
.sp
.LP
While the abort is taking place, packets issued to the transported layer may or may not be aborted.
.sp
.LP
For each packet successfully aborted, \fBtran_abort()\fR must set the \fBpkt_reason\fR to \fBCMD_ABORTED\fR, and \fBpkt_statistics\fR must be \fBOR'ed\fR with \fBSTAT_ABORTED\fR .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_abort()\fR must return:

.ne 2

.na
\fB\fB1\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
upon success or partial success.

.rt  
upon failure.

.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_abort()\fR function can be called from user or interrupt context. This requirement comes from \fBscsi_abort()\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If \fBpkt_reason\fR already indicates that an earlier error had occurred, \fBtran_abort()\fR should not overwrite \fBpkt_reason\fR with \fBCMD_ABORTED\fR.
