.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_tgt_free()\fR vector in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure may be initialized during the \fBHBA\fR driver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to an \fBHBA\fR driver function to be called by the system when an instance of a target device is being detached.  The \fBtran_tgt_free()\fR vector, if not  \fINULL\fR, is called after the target device instance has returned successfully from its \fBdetach\fR(9E) entry point, but before the \fBdev_info\fR node structure is removed from the system. The \fBHBA\fR driver should release any resources allocated during its \fBtran_tgt_init()\fR or \fBtran_tgt_probe()\fR initialization performed for this target device instance.
