.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_sync_pkt()\fR vector in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure must be initialized during the \fBHBA\fR driver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to an \fBHBA\fR driver entry point to be called when a target driver calls \fBscsi_sync_pkt\fR(9F). 
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_sync_pkt()\fR must synchronize a \fBHBA\fR's or device's view of the data associated with the \fIpkt\fR, typically by calling \fBddi_dma_sync\fR(9F). The operation may also involve \fBHBA\fR hardware-specific details, such as  flushing \fBI/O\fR caches, or stalling until hardware buffers have been drained.

A target driver may call \fBtran_sync_pkt()\fR on packets for which no \fBDMA\fR resources were allocated.
