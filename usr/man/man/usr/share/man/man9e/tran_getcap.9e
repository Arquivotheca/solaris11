.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_getcap()\fR and \fBtran_setcap()\fR vectors in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure must be initialized during the \fBHBA \fRdriver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to \fBHBA \fRentry points to be called when a target driver calls \fBscsi_ifgetcap\fR(9F) and \fBscsi_ifsetcap\fR(9F). 
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_getcap()\fR is called to get the current value of a capability specific to features provided by the \fBHBA \fRhardware or driver.  The name of the capability \fIcap\fR is the \fINULL\fR terminated capability string.
.sp
.LP
If \fIwhom\fR is non-zero, the request is for the current value of the capability defined for the target specified by the  \fBscsi_address\fR(9S) structure pointed to by \fIap\fR; if \fIwhom\fR is \fB0\fR, all targets are affected; else, the target specified by the \fBscsi_address\fR structure pointed to by \fIap\fR is affected.
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_setcap()\fR is called to set the value of the capability \fIcap\fR to the value of \fIvalue\fR. If \fIwhom\fR is non-zero, the capability should be set for the target specified by the \fBscsi_address\fR(9S) structure pointed to by \fIap\fR; if \fIwhom\fR is \fB0\fR, all targets are affected; else, the target specified by the \fBscsi_address\fR structure pointed to by \fIap\fR is affected. It is recommended that \fBHBA \fRdrivers do not support setting capabilities for all targets, that is, \fIwhom\fR is \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
A device may support only a subset of the defined capabilities.
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBscsi_ifgetcap\fR(9F) for the list of defined capabilities.
.sp
.LP
\fBHBA \fRdrivers should use \fBscsi_hba_lookup_capstr\fR(9F) to match \fIcap\fR against the canonical capability strings.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_setcap()\fR must return  \fB1\fR if the capability was successfully set to the new value, \fB0\fR if the \fBHBA \fR driver does not support changing the capability, and  \fB\(mi1\fR if the capability was not defined.
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_getcap()\fR must return the current value of a capability or  \fB\(mi1\fR if the capability was not defined.
