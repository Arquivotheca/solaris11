.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtran_tgt_init()\fR vector in the \fBscsi_hba_tran\fR(9S) structure may be initialized during the \fBHBA\fR driver's \fBattach\fR(9E) to point to an \fBHBA\fR driver function to be called by the system when an instance of a target device is being created.  The \fBtran_tgt_init()\fR vector, if not  \fINULL\fR,is called after the \fBdev_info\fR node structure is created for this target device instance, but before \fBprobe\fR(9E) for this instance is called. Before receiving transport requests from the target driver instance, the \fBHBA\fR may perform any initialization required for this particular target during the call of the \fBtran_tgt_init()\fR vector.
.sp
.LP
Note that \fIhba_tran\fR will point to a cloned copy of the \fBscsi_hba_tran_t\fR structure allocated by the \fBHBA\fR driver if the \fBSCSI_HBA_TRAN_CLONE\fR flag was specified in the call to \fBscsi_hba_attach\fR(9F). In this case, the \fBHBA\fR driver may choose to initialize the \fItran_tgt_private\fR field in the structure pointed to by \fIhba_tran\fR, to point to the data specific to the particular target device instance.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBtran_tgt_init()\fR must return:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDDI_SUCCESS\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
the \fBHBA\fR driver can support the addressed target, and was able to initialize per-target resources.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDDI_FAILURE\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
the \fBHBA\fR driver cannot support the addressed target, or was unable to initialize per-target resources. In this event, the initialization of this instance of the target device will not be continued, the target driver's \fBprobe\fR(9E) will not be called, and the \fItgt_dip\fR structure destroyed.
