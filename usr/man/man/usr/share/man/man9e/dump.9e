.SH INTERFACE LEVEL

Solaris specific (Solaris DDI). This entry point is \fBrequired\fR. For drivers that do not implement \fBdump()\fR routines, \fBnodev\fR(9F) should be used.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdump()\fR is used to dump a portion of virtual address space directly to a device in the case of system failure. It can also be used for checking the state of the kernel during a checkpoint operation. The memory area to be dumped is specified by \fIaddr\fR (base address) and \fInblk\fR (length). It is dumped to the device specified by \fIdev\fR starting at offset \fIblkno\fR. Upon completion \fBdump()\fR returns the status of the transfer.
.sp
.LP
When the system is panicking, the calls of functions scheduled by \fBtimeout\fR(9F) and \fBddi_trigger_softintr\fR(9F) will never occur. Neither can delay(9F) be relied upon, since it is implemented via \fBtimeout()\fR. See \fBddi_in_panic\fR(9F).
.sp
.LP
\fBdump()\fR is called at interrupt priority.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
\fBdump()\fR returns \fB0\fR on success, or the appropriate error number.
