.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions operate on contract control file descriptors obtained from the \fBcontract\fR(4) file system.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_adopt()\fR function adopts the contract referenced by the file descriptor \fIfd\fR. After a successful call to \fBct_ctl_adopt()\fR, the contract is owned by the calling process and any events in that contract's event queue are appended to the process's bundle of the appropriate type.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_abandon()\fR function abandons the contract referenced by the file descriptor \fIfd\fR. After a successful call to \fBct_ctl_abandon()\fR the process no longer owns the contract, any events sent by that contract are automatically removed from the process's bundle, and any critical events on the contract's event queue are automatically acknowledged. Depending on its type and terms, the contract will either be orphaned or destroyed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_ack()\fR function acknowledges the critical event specified by\fIevid\fR. If the event corresponds to an exit negotiation, \fBct_ctl_ack()\fR also indicates that the caller is prepared for the system to proceed with the referenced reconfiguration.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_nack()\fR function acknowledges the critical negotiation event specified by \fIevid\fR.  The \fBct_ctl_nack()\fR function also indicates that the caller wishes to block the proposed reconfiguration indicated by event \fIevid\fR. Depending on the contract type, this function might require certain privileges to be asserted in the process's effective set. This function will fail and return an error if the event represented by \fIevid\fR is not a negotiation event.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_qack()\fR function requests a new quantum of time for the negotiation specified by the event ID \fIevid\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBct_ctl_newct()\fR function instructs the contract specified by the file descriptor \fIfd\fR that when the current exit negotiation completes, another contract with the terms provided by the template specified by \fItemplatefd\fR should be automatically written.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBct_ctl_adopt()\fR, \fBct_ctl_abandon()\fR, \fBct_ctl_newct()\fR, \fBct_ctl_ack()\fR, and \fBct_ctl_qack()\fR return 0. Otherwise, they return a non-zero error value.
