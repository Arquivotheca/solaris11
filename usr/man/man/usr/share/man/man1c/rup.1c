.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrup\fR gives a status similar to \fBuptime\fR for remote machines. It broadcasts on the local network, and displays the responses it receives.
.sp
.LP
Normally, the listing is in the order that responses are received, but this order can be changed by specifying one of the options listed below.
.sp
.LP
When \fIhost\fR arguments are given, rather than broadcasting \fBrup\fR only queries the list of specified hosts.
