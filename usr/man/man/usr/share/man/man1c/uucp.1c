.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "uucp"
.sp
.LP
The \fBuucp\fR utility copies files named by the \fIsource-file\fR arguments to the \fIdestination-file\fR argument.
.SS "uulog"
.sp
.LP
The \fBuulog\fR utility queries a log file of \fBuucp\fR or \fBuuxqt\fR transactions in file \fB/var/uucp/.Log/uucico/\fIsystem\fR\fR or \fB/var/uucp/.Log/uuxqt/\fIsystem\fR\fR.
.SS "uuname"
.sp
.LP
The \fBuuname\fR utility lists the names of systems known to \fBuucp\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "uucp"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported by \fBuucp\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Does not copy local file to the spool directory for transfer to the remote machine (default).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Forces the copy of local files to the spool directory for transfer.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Makes all necessary directories for the file copy (default).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Does not make intermediate directories for the file copy.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIgrade\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
\fIgrade\fR can be either a single letter, number, or a string of alphanumeric characters defining a service grade. The \fBuuglist\fR command can determine whether it is appropriate to use the single letter, number, or a string of alphanumeric characters as a service grade. The output from the \fBuuglist\fR command is a list of service grades that are available, or a message that says to use a single letter or number as a grade of service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-j\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Prints the \fBuucp\fR job identification string on standard output. This job identification can be used by \fBuustat\fR to obtain the status of a \fBuucp\fR job or to terminate a \fBuucp\fR job. The \fBuucp\fR job is valid as long as the job remains queued on the local system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Sends mail to the requester when the copy is complete.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIuser\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Notifies \fIuser\fR on the remote system that a file was sent.
.sp
When multiple \fB-n\fR options are passed in, \fBuucp\fR only retains the value specified for the last \fB-n\fR option. This is the only user notified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Does not start the file transfer, just queue the job.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Reports status of the transfer to \fIfile\fR. This option is accepted for compatibility, but it is ignored because it is insecure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fIdebug_level\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Produce debugging output on standard output. \fIdebug_level\fR is a number between 0 and 9. As \fIdebug_level\fR increases to 9, more detailed debugging information is given. This option may not be available on all systems.
.RE

.SS "uulog"
.sp
.LP

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIsystem\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Executes a \fBtail\fR \fB-f\fR command of the file transfer log for \fIsystem\fR. You must press BREAK to exit this function.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Other options used in conjunction with the above options are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Looks in the \fBuuxqt\fR log file for the given system.

.RE

.SS "uuname"
.sp
.LP

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Displays the names of systems known to \fBcu\fR. The two lists are the same, unless your machine is using different \fBSystems\fR files for \fBcu\fR and \fBuucp\fR. See the \fBSysfiles\fR file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt

.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The source file name may be a path name on your machine, or may have the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIsystem-name\fR!\fIpathname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIsystem-name\fR is taken from a list of system names that \fBuucp\fR knows about. \fIsource_file\fR is restricted to no more than one \fIsystem-name\fR. The destination \fIsystem-name\fR may also include a list of system names such as
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIsystem-name\fR!\fIsystem-name\fR!...!\fIsystem-name\fR!\fIpathname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this case, an attempt is made to send the file, using the specified route, to the destination. Care should be taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the route are willing to forward information. See \fBNOTES\fR for restrictions.
.sp
.LP
For C-Shell users, the exclamation point (\fB!\fR) character must be surrounded by single quotes (\fB\&'\fR), or preceded by a backslash (\fB\e\fR).
.sp
.LP
The shell metacharacters \fB?\fR, \fB*\fR and \fB[...]\fR appearing in \fIpathname\fR are expanded on the appropriate system.
.sp
.LP
Pathnames may be one of the following:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
An absolute pathname.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
A pathname preceded by \fB~\fR\fIuser\fR where \fIuser\fR is a login name on the specified system and is replaced by that user's login directory.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
A pathname preceded by \fB~\fR/\fIdestination\fR where \fIdestination\fR is appended to \fB/var/spool/uucppublic\fR. This destination is treated as a filename unless more than one file is being transferred by this request or the destination is already a directory. To ensure that the destination is a directory, follow it with a forward slash (\fB/\fR). For example, \fB~/dan/\fR as the destination creates the directory \fB/var/spool/uucppublic/dan\fR if it does not exist and put the requested file(s) in that directory.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Anything else is prefixed by the current directory.
.sp
.LP
If the result is an erroneous path name for the remote system, the copy fails. If the \fIdestination-file\fR is a directory, the last part of the \fIsource-file\fR name is used.
.sp
.LP
Invoking \fBuucp\fR with shell wildcard characters as the remote \fIsource-file\fR invokes the \fBuux\fR(1C) command to execute the \fBuucp\fR command on the remote machine. The remote \fBuucp\fR command spools the files on the remote machine. After the first session terminates, if the remote machine is configured to transfer the spooled files to the local machine, the remote machine initiates a call and send the files; otherwise, the user must "call" the remote machine to transfer the files from the spool directory to the local machine. This call can be done manually using \fBUutry\fR(1M), or as a side effect of another \fBuux\fR(1C) or \fBuucp\fR call.
.sp
.LP
Notice that the local machine must have permission to execute the uucp command on the remote machine in order for the remote machine to send the spooled files.
.sp
.LP
\fBuucp\fR removes execute permissions across the transmission and gives \fB0666\fR read and write permissions (see \fBchmod\fR(2)).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBuucp\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBNLSPATH\fR, and \fBTZ\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP

.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
For security reasons, the domain of remotely accessible files may be severely restricted. You probably are not able to access files by path name. Ask a responsible person on the remote system to send them to you. For the same reasons you are probably not able to send files to arbitrary path names. As distributed, the remotely accessible files are those whose names begin \fB/var/spool/uucppublic\fR (equivalent to \fB~/\fR).
.sp
.LP
All files received by \fBuucp\fR are owned by \fBuucp\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-m\fR option only works when sending files or receiving a single file. Receiving multiple files specified by special shell characters \fB?\fR, \fB&\fR, and \fB[\|.\|.\|.\|]\fR does not activate the \fB-m\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The forwarding of files through other systems may not be compatible with the previous version of \fBuucp\fR. If forwarding is used, all systems in the route must have compatible versions of \fBuucp\fR.
.sp
.LP
Protected files and files that are in protected directories that are owned by the requester can be sent by \fBuucp\fR. However, if the requester is root, and the directory is not searchable by "other" or the file is not readable by "other", the request fails.
.sp
.LP
Strings that are passed to remote systems may not be evaluated in the same locale as the one in use by the process that invoked \fBuucp\fR on the local system.
.sp
.LP
Configuration files must be treated as C (or POSIX) locale text files.
