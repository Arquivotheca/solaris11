.TH uuto 1C "28 Mar 1995" "SunOS 5.11" "Communication Commands"
.SH NAME
uuto, uupick \- public UNIX-to-UNIX system file copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBuuto\fR [\fB-mp\fR] \fIsource-file\fR... \fIdestination\fR
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBuupick\fR [\fB-s\fR \fIsystem\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "uuto"
.sp
.LP
\fBuuto\fR sends \fIsource-file\fR to \fIdestination\fR. \fBuuto\fR uses the \fBuucp\fR(1C) facility to send files, while it allows the local system to control the file access. A source-file name is a path name on your machine. Destination has the form:
.sp
.LP
\fBsystem\fR[\fI!system\fR]\fI ... !user\fR
.sp
.LP
where \fBsystem\fR is taken from a list of system names that \fBuucp\fR knows about.  \fIUser\fR is the login name of someone on the specified system.
.sp
.LP
The files (or sub-trees if directories are specified) are sent to \fBPUBDIR\fR on \fBsystem\fR, where \fBPUBDIR\fR is a public directory defined in the \fBuucp\fR source. By default, this directory is \fB/var/spool/uucppublic\fR. Specifically the files are sent to
.sp
.LP
\fBPUBDIR/receive/\fR\fIuser\fR/\fImysystem\fR/files.
.sp
.LP
The recipient is notified by \fBmail\fR(1) of the arrival of files.
.SS "uupick"
.sp
.LP
\fBuupick\fR accepts or rejects the files transmitted to the user. Specifically, \fBuupick\fR searches \fBPUBDIR\fR for files destined for the user. For each entry (file or directory) found, the following message is printed on standard output:
.sp
.LP
\fBfrom system \fR\fIsysname\fR\fB:\fR [file \fIfile-name\fR] [dir \fBdirname\fR] \fB?\fR
.sp
.LP
\fBuupick\fR then reads a line from standard input to determine the disposition of the file:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB<new-line>\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Go to next entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Delete the entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBm\fR [ \fIdir\fR ]\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Move the entry to named directory \fIdir.\fR If \fIdir\fR is not specified as a complete path name (in which  \fB$\fR\fBHOME\fR is legitimate), a destination relative to the current directory is assumed.  If no destination is given, the default is the current directory.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBa\fR [ \fIdir\fR ]\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Same as \fBm\fR above, except it moves all the files sent from \fBsystem\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBp\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Print the content of the file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported for  \fBuuto\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdestination\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A string of the form:
.sp
\fIsystem-name\fR\fB\|!\|\fR\fIuser\fR
.sp
where \fIsystem-name\fR is taken from a list of system names that \fBuucp\fR knows about; see \fBuuname\fR. The argument \fIuser\fR is the login name of someone on the specified system. The destination \fIsystem-name\fR can also be a list of names such as
.sp
\fIsystem-name\fR\|\fB!\fR\|\fIsystem-name\|\fR\fB!\|\fR.\|.\|.\fB \|!\|\fR\fIsystem-name\|\fR\fB!\fR\fI\|user\fR
.sp
in which case, an attempt is made to send the file via the specified route to the destination. Care should be taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the route are willing to forward information.

In order to send files that begin with a dot (for instance, \fB\&.profile\fR), the files must  be qualified with a dot.  For example, the following files are correct:
.sp
.LP
\fB\|          .profile        .prof*       .profil?\fR
