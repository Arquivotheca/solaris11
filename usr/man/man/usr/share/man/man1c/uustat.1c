.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBuustat\fR utility functions in the following three areas:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Displays the general status of, or cancels, previously specified \fBuucp\fR commands.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Provides remote system performance information, in terms of average transfer rates or average queue times.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Provides general remote system-specific and user-specific status of \fBuucp\fR connections to other systems.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.SS "General Status"
.sp
.LP
These options obtain general status of, or cancel, previously  specified \fBuucp\fR commands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lists all jobs in queue.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-j\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lists the total number of jobs displayed. The \fB-j\fR option can be used in conjunction with the \fB-a\fR or the \fB-s\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fIjobid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Kills the \fBuucp\fR request whose job identification is \fIjobid\fR. The killed \fBuucp\fR request must belong to the user  issuing the \fBuustat\fR command unless the user is the super-user or uucp administrator. If the job is killed by the super-user or uucp administrator, electronic mail is sent to the user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Reports the status of accessibility of all machines.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Suppresses all standard output, but not standard error. The \fB-n\fR option is used in conjunction with the \fB-k\fR and \fB-r\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Executes the command \fBps\fR \fB-flp\fR for all the process-ids that are in the lock files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lists the jobs queued for each machine. If a status file exists for the machine, its date, time and status information are reported. In addition, if a number appears in parentheses next to the number of \fBC\fR or \fBX\fR files, it is the age in days of the oldest \fBC.\fR/\fBX.\fR file for that system. The \fBRetry\fR field represents the number of hours until the next possible call. The \fBCount\fR is the number of failure attempts. \fBNote:\fR For systems with a moderate number of outstanding jobs, this could take 30 seconds or more of real-time to execute. An example of the output produced by the \fB-q\fR option is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
eagle    3C      04/07-11:07     NO DEVICES AVAILABLE
mh3bs3	2C	07/07-10:42	SUCCESSFUL
.fi
.in -2
.sp

This indicates the number of command files that are waiting for each system. Each command file may have zero or more files to be sent (zero means to call the system and see if work is to be done). The date and time refer to the previous interaction with the system followed by the status of the interaction.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fIjobid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Rejuvenates \fIjobid\fR. The files associated with \fIjobid\fR are touched so that  their modification time is set to the current time. This prevents the cleanup daemon from deleting the job until the jobs' modification time reaches the limit imposed by the daemon.
.RE

.SS "Remote System Status"
.sp
.LP
These options provide remote system performance information, in terms of average transfer rates or average queue times. The \fB-c\fR and \fB-d\fR options can only be used in conjunction with the \fB-t\fR option:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fIsystem\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Reports the average transfer rate or average queue time for the past 60 minutes for the remote \fIsystem\fR. The following parameters can only be used with this option:
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Average queue time is calculated when the \fB-c\fR parameter is specified and average transfer rate when \fB-c\fR is not specified. For example, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBuustat -teagle -d50 -c\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

produces output in the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
average queue time to eagle for last 50 minutes:
     5 seconds
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The same command without the \fB-c\fR parameter produces output in the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
average transfer rate with eagle for last 50 minutes:
     2000.88 bytes/sec
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
\fInumber\fR is specified in minutes. Used to override the 60 minute default used for calculations. These calculations are based on information contained in the optional performance log and therefore may not be available. Calculations can only be made from the time that the performance log was last cleaned up.
.RE

.SS "User- or System-Specific Status"
.sp
.LP
These options provide general remote system-specific and user-specific status of \fBuucp\fR connections to other systems. Either or both of the following options can be specified with \fBuustat\fR. The \fB-j\fR option can be used in conjunction with the \fB-s\fR option to list the total number of jobs displayed:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fIsystem\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Reports the status of all \fBuucp\fR requests for remote system \fIsystem.\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fIuser\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Reports the status of all \fBuucp\fR requests issued by \fIuser\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Output for both the \fB-s\fR and \fB-u\fR options has the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
eagleN1bd7  4/07-11:07    S     eagle   dan     522     /home/dan/A

.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
With the above two options, the first field is the \fIjobid\fR of the job. This is followed by the date/time. The next field is an \fBS\fR if the job is sending a file or an \fBR\fR if the job is requesting a file. The next field is the machine where the file is to be transferred. This is followed by the user-id of the user who queued the job. The next field contains the size of the file, or in the case of a remote execution (\fBrmail\fR is the command used for remote mail), the name of the command. When the size appears in this field, the file name is also given. This can either be the name given by the user or an internal name (for example, \fBD.3b2alce4924\fR) that is created for data files associated with remote executions (\fBrmail\fR in this example).

for completed jobs
.RE

A job is queued if the transfer has not started. A job is running when the transfer has begun. A job is interrupted if the transfer began but was terminated before the file was completely  transferred. A completed job is a job that successfully transferred. The completed state information is maintained in the accounting log,  which is optional and therefore may be unavailable. The parameters can be used in any combination, but at least one parameter must be specified. The \fB-S\fR option can also be used with \fB-s\fR and \fB-u\fR options. The output for this option is exactly like the output for \fB-s\fR and \fB-u\fR except that the job states are appended as the last output word. Output for a completed job has the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf

When no options are given, \fBuustat\fR writes to standard output the status of all \fBuucp\fR requests issued by the current user.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
The \fB-t\fR option produces no message when the data needed for the calculations is not being recorded.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
After the user has issued the \fBuucp\fR request, if the file to be transferred is moved, deleted or was not copied to the spool directory  (\fB-C\fR option) when the \fBuucp\fR request was made, \fBuustat\fR reports a file size of \fB\(mi99999\fR\&. This job will eventually fail because the file(s) to be transferred can not be found.
