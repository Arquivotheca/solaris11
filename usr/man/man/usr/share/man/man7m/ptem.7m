.SH NAME
ptem \- STREAMS Pseudo Terminal Emulation module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBint ioctl(\fR\fIfd\fR, \fBI_PUSH\fR,\fB "ptem");\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBptem\fR is a STREAMS module that, when used in conjunction with a line discipline and pseudo terminal driver, emulates a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fBptem\fR module must be pushed (see  \fBI_PUSH\fR, \fBstreamio\fR(7I)) onto the slave side of a pseudo terminal STREAM, before the \fBldterm\fR(7M) module is pushed.
.sp
.LP
On the write-side, the \fBTCSETA\fR, \fBTCSETAF\fR, \fBTCSETAW\fR, \fBTCGETA\fR, \fBTCSETS\fR, \fBTCSETSW\fR, \fBTCSETSF\fR, \fBTCGETS\fR, \fBTCSBRK\fR, \fBJWINSIZE\fR, \fBTIOCGWINSZ\fR, and \fBTIOCSWINSZ\fR \fBtermio\fR \fBioctl\fR(2) messages are processed and acknowledged. If remote mode is not in effect, \fBptem\fR handles the \fBTIOCSTI\fR ioctl by copying the argument bytes into an  \fBM_DATA\fR message and passing it back up the read side. Regardless of the remote mode setting, \fBptem\fR acknowledges the ioctl and passes a copy of it downstream for possible further processing. A hang up (that is, \fBstty 0\fR) is converted to a zero length \fBM_DATA\fR message and passed downstream. Termio \fBcflags\fR and window row and column information are stored locally one per stream. \fBM_DELAY\fR messages are discarded. All other messages are passed downstream unmodified.
.sp
.LP
On the read-side all messages are passed upstream unmodified with the following exceptions. All \fBM_READ\fR and \fBM_DELAY\fR messages are freed in both directions. A \fBTCSBRK\fR ioctl is converted to an \fBM_BREAK\fR message and  passed upstream and an acknowledgement is returned downstream. A \fBTIOCSIGNAL\fR ioctl is converted into an \fBM_PCSIG\fR message,  and passed upstream and an acknowledgement is returned downstream. Finally a \fBTIOCREMOTE\fR ioctl is converted into an \fBM_CTL\fR message, acknowledged, and passed upstream; the resulting mode is retained for use in subsequent \fBTIOCSTI\fR parsing.
