.SH NAME
pckt \- STREAMS Packet Mode module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
int ioctl(\fI fd, \fRI_PUSH, "pckt");
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpckt\fR is a STREAMS module that may be used with a pseudo terminal to packetize certain messages. The \fBpckt\fR module should be pushed (see  \fBI_PUSH\fR on  \fBstreamio\fR(7I)) onto the master side of a pseudo terminal.
.sp
.LP
Packetizing is performed by prefixing a message with an  \fBM_PROTO\fR message. The original message type is stored in the 1 byte data portion of the \fBM_PROTO\fR message.
.sp
.LP
On the read-side, only the \fBM_PROTO\fR, \fBM_PCPROTO\fR, \fBM_STOP\fR,  \fBM_START\fR, \fBM_STOPI\fR, \fBM_STARTI\fR, \fBM_IOCTL\fR, \fBM_DATA\fR, \fBM_FLUSH\fR, and  \fBM_READ\fR messages are packetized. All other message types are passed upstream unmodified.
.sp
.LP
Since all unread state information is held in the master's stream head read queue, flushing of this queue is disabled.
.sp
.LP
On the write-side, all messages are sent down unmodified.
.sp
.LP
With this module in place, all reads from the master side of the pseudo terminal should be performed with the  \fBgetmsg\fR(2) or \fBgetpmsg\fR() function. The control part of the message contains the message type. The data part contains the actual data associated with that message type. The onus is on the application to separate the data into its component parts.
