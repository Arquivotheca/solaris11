.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfp\fR port driver plug-in \fB/usr/lib/cfgadm/fp.so.1\fR provides the functionality for Fibre Channel Fabric device node management through \fBcfgadm\fR(1M). \fBcfgadm\fR operates on attachment points. Attachment points are locations in the system where hardware resources can be dynamically reconfigured. Refer to \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) for additional details on attachment points.
.sp
.LP
For Fibre Channel Fabric device node management, each \fBfp\fR port node is represented by an attachment point in the device tree. In addition, each Fibre Channel device is represented by a dynamic attachment point. Attachment points are named through \fBap_ids\fR. Two types of \fBap_ids\fR are defined: logical and physical. The physical \fBap_id\fR is based on the physical pathname. The logical \fBap_id\fR is a shorter, more user-friendly name. For \fBfp\fR port nodes, the logical \fBap_id\fR is the corresponding disk controller number. For example, \fBc0\fR is a typical logical \fBap_id\fR.
.sp
.LP
Fibre Channel devices are named with a port World Wide Name (WWN). If a disk device is connected to controller \fBc0\fR, its \fBap_id\fR can be:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
c0::50020f2300006077
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fB50020f2300006077\fR identifies the port WWN of a specific Fibre Channel device.
.sp
.LP
Each device on the Fibre Channel private loop port, Fabric port or public loop port is probed and made available to Solaris by default. Devices connected to the Fibre Channel Fabric port or public loop port can be made unavailable to Solaris by initiating an application or an end user operation. The operation is similar to the hot unplugging of devices by way of management user interfaces. Applications or users can use the \fB/usr/lib/cfgadm/fp.so.1\fR library to enable \fBlibcfgadm\fR to provide interfaces to accomplish this task.
.sp
.LP
The list of currently connected Fabric devices is generated in the form of the attachment point. 
.sp
.LP
A simple listing of attachment points in the system includes attachment points at \fBfp\fR port nodes but not Fibre Channel devices. The following example uses the \fB-a\fR flag to the list option (\fB-l\fR) to list Fibre Channel devices:

In this example, the \fBfc-fabric\fR type of \fBap_id\fR \fBc0\fR indicates that the \fBfp\fR port is connected to Fabric. For an \fBfp\fR port with a Fabric-related type such as \fBfc-fabric\fR and \fBfc-public\fR, device node creation happens by default at the boot time and can be managed by the \fBcfgadm\fR configure and unconfigure operations. The  \fBfc-private\fR  type  of \fBap_id c1\fR indicates that \fBfp\fR port is connected to private-loop and device node creation happens by default as well. The \fBfc-pt_to_pt\fR type of \fBap_id c2\fR indicates that the \fBfp\fR port is directly connected to another \fBN_port\fR and device node creation also happens by default. The \fBfc\fR type of \fBap_id c3\fR indicates that nothing is attached to \fBfp\fR port \fBc2\fR. The Type field of a Fibre Channel  device \fBap_id\fR shows the SCSI device type of LUN 0 in the device.
.sp
.LP
A Fibre Channel device with multiple FCP SCSI LUNs is configured into Solaris and each \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fR is available as a Solaris device. Suppose that ap_ids \fBc0::50020f2300006077\fR and \fBc0::50020f23000063a9\fR represent Fibre Channel devices with multiple \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fRs.

In this example, the \fBap_id c0::50020f2300006077,0\fR identifies the \fBFCP SCSI LUN 0\fR of the Fibre Channel device which is represented by port \fBWWN 50020f2300006077\fR. The Fibre Channel device is reported to have 4 \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fRs and they are all configured. \fB4 FCP SCSI LUN\fR level ap_ids associated with port \fBWWN 50020f2300006077\fR are listed. The listing also displays \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fRs for unconfigured Fibre Channel devices. The Fibre Channel device represented by \fBc0::50020f2300005f24\fR is reported to have two \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fRs. The configure operation \fBon c0::50020f2300005f24\fR creates two Solaris devices. The \fBType\fR field of \fBFCP\fR \fBSCSI\fR \fBLUN\fR level ap_ids show the \fBSCSI\fR device type of each \fBLUN\fR. When a Fibre Channel device has different device type \fBLUN\fRs, the \fBType\fR field reflects that.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBconfigure\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Configure a connected Fibre Channel Fabric device to a host. When a Fibre Channel device is listed as an unknown type in the output of the list operation the device might not be configurable. No attempt is made to configure devices with unknown types. The force option (\fB-f\fR) can be used to force the \fBfp\fR port driver plug-in to make an attempt to configure any devices. Any errors in the process are reported. By default, each FCP SCSI LUN that is discovered on a Fibre channel Fabric device is configured. However, FCP SCSI LUNs that are specified in the "pwwn-lun-blacklist" property in the \fBfp.conf\fR file will remain unconfigured. The FCP SCSI LUN level listing reflects the state of such FCP SCSI LUNs. They stay in the "unconfigured" state after reboot or Solaris Dynamic Reconfiguration on the controller that they are connected through. Refer to \fBfp\fR(7D) for additional details on the "pwwn-lun-blacklist" property.

\fB\fBunconfigure\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unconfigure a Fibre Channel Fabric device from a host. This device stays unconfigured until the next reboot or Solaris Dynamic Reconfiguration on the controller that the device is connected, at which time all fabric devices are automatically enumerated. The default behavior may be changed through the use of the "manual_configuration_only" property in the \fBfp.conf\fR file. If the property is set, the device remains unconfigured after reboot. Refer to \fBfp\fR(7D) for additional details on the "manual_configuration_only" property.
.RE

For Fibre Channel private loop devices and \fBN_Port\fR point-to-point devices, the \fBconfigure\fR command returns success without doing any operation. The \fBunconfigure\fR command is not supported on the private loop devices and \fBN_Port\fR point-to-point devices. The private loop  devices and \fBN_Port\fR point-to-point devices are configured by Solaris Fibre Channel drivers by default and are not managed through end user- or application-initiated operations. The \fBpwwn-lun-blacklist\fR  property in the \fBfp.conf\fR  file is applied to the private loop device and \fBN_Port\fR point-to-point device in the same way it is applied to a Fabric device.

.RE

All Fibre Channel devices are available to Solaris by default. Enabling only a subset of Fabric devices available to Solaris by default can be accomplished by setting the property "manual_configuration_only" in \fB/kernel/drv/fp.conf\fR file. When "manual_configuration_only" in \fBfp.conf\fR is set, all Fabric devices are not available to Solaris unless an application or an end user had previously requested the device be configured into Solaris. The \fBconfigure\fR state-change command makes the device available to Solaris. After a successful \fBconfigure\fR operation on a Fabric device, the associated links are added to the \fB/dev\fR namespace. The \fBunconfigure\fR state-change command makes a device unavailable to Solaris. 
.sp
When a Fibre Channel Fabric device is configured successfully to a host using the \fB-c\fR \fBconfigure\fR operation, its physical \fBap_id\fR is stored in a repository. When a Fibre Channel Fabric device is unconfigured using the \fB-c\fR \fBunconfigure\fR operation, its physical \fBap_id\fR is deleted from the same repository. All fabric devices are automatically enumerated by default and the repository is used only if the \fBfp.conf\fR "manual_configuration_only" property is set.

The \fBunconfigure\fR command with \fBforce_update\fR hardware-specific option unconditionally removes the attachment point of a failing Fabric device from the repository.

For devices with unknown or no SCSI device type (for example, a Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapter), the \fBconfigure\fR operation might not be applicable.

.LP
The \fBconfigure\fR and \fBunconfigure\fR commands operate on the Fibre Channel device level which is represented by port WWN ap_id. If a Fibre Channel device has multiple FCP SCSI LUNs configured, the \fBconfigure\fR command on the associated port WWN ap_id results in creating a Solaris device for each \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fR unless it is specified in the "pwwn-lun-blacklist" property in the \fBfp.conf\fR file. The \fBunconfigure\fR command removes all Solaris devices associated with the port WWN ap_id. The \fBFCP SCSI LUN\fR level ap_id is not valid for the \fBconfigure\fR and \fBunconfigure\fR commands.

The deprecated \fBshow_FCP_dev\fR option has been replaced by the new \fBshow_SCSI_LUN\fR option, and the deprecated \fBunusable_FCP_dev\fR option has been replaced by the new \fBunusable_SCSI_LUN\fR option.
