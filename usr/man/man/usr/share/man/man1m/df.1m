.SH NAME
df \- displays number of free disk blocks and free files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdf\fR [\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR] [\fB-abeghklntPVvZ\fR]

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdf\fR utility displays the amount of disk space occupied by mounted or unmounted file systems, the amount of used and available space, and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used. The file system is specified by device, or by referring to a file or directory on the specified file system.
.sp
.LP
Used without operands or options, \fBdf\fR reports on all mounted file systems.
.sp
.LP
\fBdf\fR may not be supported for all \fIFSTypes\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fBdf\fR is run on a networked mount point that the automounter has not yet mounted, the file system size will be reported as zero. As soon as the automounter mounts the file system, the sizes will be reported correctly.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Reports on all file systems including ones whose entries in \fB/etc/mnttab\fR (see \fBmnttab\fR(4)) have the \fBignore\fR option set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints the total number of kilobytes free.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints only the number of files free.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the \fIFSType\fR on which to operate. The \fB-F\fR option is intended for use with unmounted file systems. The \fIFSType\fR should be specified here or be determinable from \fB/etc/vfstab\fR (see \fBvfstab\fR(4)) by matching the \fIdirectory\fR, \fIblock_device\fR, or \fIresource\fR with an entry in the table, or by consulting \fB/etc/default/fs\fR. See \fBdefault_fs\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints the entire \fBstatvfs\fR(2) structure. This option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the \fB-o\fR option. This option overrides the \fB-b\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-k\fR, \fB-n\fR, \fB-P\fR, and \fB-t\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Like \fB-k\fR, except that sizes are in a more human readable format. The output consists of one line of information for each specified file system. This information includes the file system name, the total space allocated in the file system, the amount of space allocated to existing files, the total amount of space available for the creation of new files by unprivileged users, and the percentage of normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on the file system. All sizes are scaled to a human readable format, for example, \fB14K\fR, \fB234M\fR, \fB2.7G\fR, or \fB3.0T\fR. Scaling is done by repetitively dividing by \fB1024\fR. 
.sp
This option overrides the \fB-b\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-g\fR, \fB-k\fR, \fB-n\fR, \fB-t\fR, and \fB-V\fR options. This option only works on mounted filesystems and can not be used together with \fB-o\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints the allocation in kbytes. The output consists of one line of information for each specified file system. This information includes the file system name, the total space allocated in the file system, the amount of space allocated to existing files, the total amount of space available for the creation of new files by unprivileged users, and the percentage of normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on the file system. This option overrides the \fB-b\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-n\fR, and \fB-t\fR options and may not be used together with the \fB-v\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Reports on local file systems only. This option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the \fB-o\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints only the \fIFSType\fR name. Invoked with no operands, this option prints a list of mounted file system types. This option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the \fB-o\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIFSType-specific_options\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies \fIFSType-specific\fR options. These options are comma-separated, with no intervening spaces. See the manual page for the \fIFSType-specific\fR command for details.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-V\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Echoes the complete set of file system specific command lines, but does not execute them. The command line is generated by using the options and operands provided by the user and adding to them information derived from \fB/etc/mnttab\fR, \fB/etc/vfstab\fR, or \fB/etc/default/fs\fR. This option may be used to verify and validate the command line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Like \fB-k\fR, except that sizes are displayed in multiples of the smallest block size supported by each specified file system.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If \fBUFS\fR logging is enabled on a file system, the disk space used for the log is reflected in the \fBdf\fR report. The log is allocated from free blocks on the file system, and it is sized approximately \fB1\fR Mbyte per \fB1\fR Gbyte of file system, up to 256 Mbytes. The log size may be larger (up to a maximum of 512 Mbytes) depending on the number of cylinder groups present in the file system.
