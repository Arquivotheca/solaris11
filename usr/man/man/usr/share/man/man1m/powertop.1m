.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBPowerTOP\fR is an observability tool that shows how effectively the system is taking advantage of the CPU's power management features. By running the tool on an otherwise idle system, the user can see for how long the CPU is running at dif- ferent power states. Ideally, an unutilized (idle) system spends 100% of its time running at the lowest power state, but because of background user and kernel activity (random software periodically waking to poll status), idle systems can consume more power than they should.
.sp
.LP
The tool analyzes system activity periodically and displays a summary of how long the processor is executing at each supported power state. It also displays the top activities responsible for causing the CPU to wake up and use more energy. This report allows the user to identify and diagnose problematic areas of the system and optimize its power efficiency.
.sp
.LP
\fBPowerTOP\fR averages the amount of activity that is preventing the CPU from entering a lower power state and presents it on the "Wakeups-from-idle per second" field. This value represents the total number of wake-ups divided by the current interval. Notice that not all events are displayed on the screen at all times.
.sp
.LP
During execution, a user can force a refresh of the analysis by pressing the \fBR\fR key. The interval time is restored to the default or to a specified value. To quit the application, the user must press the \fBQ\fR key.
.sp
.LP
PowerTOP allows you to freeze each of its three subwindows, enabling you to better analyze each subwindow's contents. When you have three different DTrace scripts running at the same time, freezing subwindows lowers CPU consumption . This feature is activated by pressing the \fBi\fR, \fBf\fR, or \fBe\fR key while the tool running. Pressing one of these keys freezes the idle, frequency, or event report, respectively. Pressing it once more, unfreezes it. This feature is most useful when invoked while the application being analyzed is running.
.sp
.LP
\fBPowerTOP\fR runs on some virtual domains. However, the report for idle state transitions might or might not be accurate as the physical CPU can be shared by different virtual CPUs. Both wakeup count and event report displays information regarding the current virtualized environment.
