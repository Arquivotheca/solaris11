.SH NAME
ufsdump \- incremental file system dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/ufsdump\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIarguments\fR] \fIfiles_to_dump\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR backs up all files specified by \fIfiles_to_dump\fR (usually either a whole file system or files within a file sytem changed after a certain date) to magnetic tape or disk file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBufsdump\fR command can only be used on unmounted file systems, or those mounted read-only. Attempting to dump a mounted, read-write file system might result in a system disruption or the inability to restore files from the dump. Consider using the \fBfssnap\fR(1M) command to create a file system snapshot if you need a point-in-time image of a file system that is mounted.
.sp
.LP
If a filesystem was mounted with the logging option, it is strongly  recommended that you run \fBufsdump\fR as the root user. Running the command as  a non-root user might result in the creation of an inconsistent dump.
.sp
.LP
\fIoptions\fR is a single string of one-letter \fBufsdump\fR options.
.sp
.LP
\fIarguments\fR may be multiple strings whose association with the options is determined by order. That is, the first argument goes with the first option that takes an argument; the second argument goes with the second option that takes an argument, and so on.
.sp
.LP
\fIfiles_to_dump\fR is required and must be the last argument on the command line. See \fBOPERANDS\fR for more information.
.sp
.LP
With most devices \fBufsdump\fR can automatically detect the end-of-media. Consequently, the \fBd\fR, \fBs\fR, and \fBt\fR options are not necessary for multi-volume dumps, unless \fBufsdump\fR does not understand the way the device detects the end-of-media, or the files are to be restored on a system with an older version of the \fBrestore\fR command.
.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported:
.sp

.na
\fB\fB0\(mi9\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The "dump level." All files specified by \fIfiles_to_dump\fR that have been modified since the last \fBufsdump\fR at a lower dump level are copied to the \fIdump_file\fR destination (normally a magnetic tape device). For instance, if a "level \fB2\fR" dump was done on Monday, followed by a "level \fB4\fR" dump on Tuesday, a subsequent "level \fB3\fR" dump on Wednesday would contain all files modified or added since the "level \fB2\fR" (Monday) backup. A "level \fB0\fR" dump copies the entire file system to the \fIdump_file\fR.

Blocking factor. Specify the blocking factor for tape writes. The default is 20 blocks per write for tapes of density less than 6250BPI (bytes-per-inch). The default blocking factor for tapes of density 6250BPI and greater is 64. The default blocking factor for cartridge tapes (\fBc\fR option) is 126. The highest blocking factor available with most tape drives is 126. Note: the blocking factor is specified in terms of 512-byte blocks, for compatibility with \fBtar\fR(1).

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Cartridge. Set the defaults for cartridge instead of the standard half-inch reel. This sets the density to 1000BPI and the blocking factor to 126. Since \fBufsdump\fR can automatically detect the end-of-media, only the blocking parameter normally has an effect. When cartridge tapes are used, and this option is \fInot\fR specified, \fBufsdump\fR will slightly miscompute the size of the tape. If the \fBb\fR, \fBd\fR, \fBs\fR or \fBt\fR options are specified with this option, their values will override the defaults set by this option.

Tape density. Not normally required, as \fBufsdump\fR can detect end-of-media. This parameter can be used to keep a running tab on the amount of tape used per reel. The default density is 6250BPI except when the \fBc\fR option is used for cartridge tape, in which case it is assumed to be 1000BPI per track. Typical values for tape devices are:

.sp
If the name of the file is of the form \fImachine\fR\fB:\fR\fIdevice,\fR the dump is done from the specified machine over the network using \fBrmt\fR(1M). Since \fBufsdump\fR is normally run by root, the name of the local machine must appear in the \fB/.rhosts\fR file of the remote machine. If the file is specified as \fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fImachine\fR\fB:\fR\fIdevice,\fR \fBufsdump\fR will attempt to execute as the specified user on the remote machine. The specified user must have a \fB\&.rhosts\fR file on the remote machine that allows the user invoking the command from the local machine to access the remote machine.

Autoload. When the end-of-tape is reached before the dump is complete, take the drive offline and wait up to two minutes for the tape drive to be ready again. This gives autoloading (stackloader) tape drives a chance to load a new tape. If the drive is ready within two minutes, continue. If it is not, prompt for another tape and wait.

Offline. Take the drive offline when the dump is complete or the end-of-media is reached and rewind the tape.

When the specified size is reached, \fBufsdump\fR waits for you to change the volume. \fBufsdump\fR interprets the specified size as the length in feet for tapes and cartridges. The values should be a little smaller than the actual physical size of the media (for example, 425 for a 450-foot cartridge).

Specifies the files to dump. Usually it identifies a whole file system by its raw device name (for example, \fB/dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s6\fR). Incremental dumps (levels \fB1\fR to \fB9\fR) of files changed after a certain date only apply to a whole file system. Alternatively, \fIfiles_to_dump\fR can identify individual files or directories. All named directories that may be examined by the user running \fBufsdump\fR, as well as any explicitly-named files, are dumped. This dump is equivalent to a level \fB0\fR dump of the indicated portions of the filesystem, except that \fB/etc/dumpdates\fR is not updated even if the \fB-u\fR option has been specified. In all cases, the files must be contained in the same file system, and the file system must be local to the system where \fBufsdump\fR is being run.

.SH NOTES
.SS "Read Errors"
.sp
.LP
Fewer than 32 read errors on the file system are ignored.
.SS "Process Per Reel"
.sp
.LP
Because each reel requires a new process, parent processes for reels that are already written hang around until the entire tape is written.
.SS "Operator Intervention"
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR requires operator intervention on these conditions: end of volume, end of dump, volume write error, volume open error or disk read error (if there are more than a threshold of 32). In addition to alerting all operators implied by the \fBn\fR option, \fBufsdump\fR interacts with the operator on \fBufsdump\fR's control terminal at times when \fBufsdump\fR can no longer proceed, or if something is grossly wrong. All questions \fBufsdump\fR poses \fImust\fR be answered by typing \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR, as appropriate.
.sp
.LP
Since backing up a disk can involve a lot of time and effort, \fBufsdump\fR checkpoints at the start of each volume. If writing that volume fails for some reason, \fBufsdump\fR will, with operator permission, restart itself from the checkpoint after a defective volume has been replaced.
.SS "Suggested Dump Schedule"
.sp
.LP
It is vital to perform full, "level \fB0\fR", dumps at regular intervals. When performing a full dump, bring the machine down to single-user mode using \fBshutdown\fR(1M). While preparing for a full dump, it is a good idea to clean the tape drive and heads. Incremental dumps should be performed with the system running in single-user mode.
.sp
.LP
Incremental dumps allow for convenient backup and recovery of active files on a more frequent basis, with a minimum of media and time. However, there are some tradeoffs. First, the interval between backups should be kept to a minimum (once a day at least). To guard against data loss as a result of a media failure (a rare, but possible occurrence), capture active files on (at least) two sets of dump volumes. Another consideration is the desire to keep unnecessary duplication of files to a minimum to save both operator time and media storage. A third consideration is the ease with which a particular backed-up version of a file can be located and restored. The following four-week schedule offers a reasonable tradeoff between these goals.

Although the Tuesday through Friday incrementals contain "extra copies" of files from Monday, this scheme assures that any file modified during the week can be recovered from the previous day's incremental dump.
.SS "Process Priority of ufsdump"
.sp
.LP
\fBufsdump\fR uses multiple processes to allow it to read from the disk and write to the media concurrently. Due to the way it synchronizes between these processes, any attempt to run dump with a \fBnice\fR (process priority) of `\(mi5' or better will likely make \fBufsdump\fR run \fIslower\fR instead of faster.
.SS "Overlapping Partitions"
.sp
.LP
Most disks contain one or more overlapping slices because slice 2 covers the entire disk. The other slices are of various sizes and usually do not overlap. For example, a common configuration places \fBroot\fR on slice 0, \fBswap\fR on slice 1, \fB/opt\fR on slice 5 and \fB/usr\fR on slice 6.
.sp
.LP
It should be emphasized that \fBufsdump\fR dumps one \fBufs\fR file system at a time. Given the above scenario where slice 0 and slice 2 have the same starting offset, executing \fBufsdump\fR on slice 2 with the intent of dumping the entire disk would instead dump only the \fBroot\fR file system on slice 0. To dump the entire disk, the user must dump the file systems on each slice separately.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file does not allow the desired frequency of backup for file systems to be specified (as \fB/etc/fstab\fR did). Consequently, the \fBw\fR and \fBW\fR options assume file systems should be backed up daily, which limits the usefulness of these options.
