.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBth_manage\fR applies the action specified by \fIcommand\fR to the instance specified by \fIinstance\fR of the driver specified by \fIname\fR (or the driver instance specified by \fIpath\fR). The driver instance must be running fault injection specifications (errdefs) defined by \fBth_define\fR(1M). 
.sp
.LP
\fBth_manage\fR supports several commands that operate on the driver instance specified by \fIname\fR and \fIinstance\fR (or \fIpath\fR). The commands are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbroadcast\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Awaken all \fBth_define\fR processes, causing them to display their current status and exit if the errdef is now defunct (that is, if \fIcount\fR, \fIfailcount \fR, and \fIacc_chk \fR are all zero).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBclear_acc_chk\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Awaken all \fBth_define\fR processes. If \fIcount\fR and \fIfailcount\fR are already zero, then set \fIacc_chk\fR to zero, so that \fBth_define\fR exits once it has displayed its status.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBclear_errdefs\fR \fR

.RS 18n
.rt  
Awaken all \fBth_define\fR \fBprocesses\fR. \fIcount\fR, \fIfailcount\fR and \fIacc_chk\fR are all set to zero so that all \fBth_define\fR commands exit once they have displayed their status.

\fBExample 1 \fRUseful Commands
.sp
.LP
To begin the tests, enter:

.sp
.LP
\fB#\fR \fBth_manage\fR \fBfoo\fR \fB0\fR \fBstart\fR 

.sp
.LP
To check the status of the errdefs, enter:

.sp
.LP
\fB#\fR \fBth_manage\fR \fBfoo\fR \fB0\fR \fBbroadcast\fR 

.sp
.LP
This causes each \fBth_define\fR process to print out its current status.

.sp
.LP
If the driver has reported a fatal error, you can take the driver offline using \fBlibdevice\fR, clear the error condition by entering:

.sp
.LP
\fB#\fR \fBth_manage\fR \fBfoo\fR \fB0\fR \fBclear_acc_chk\fR 

.sp
.LP
or

.sp
.LP
\fB#\fR \fBth_manage\fR \fBfoo\fR \fB0\fR \fBclear_errors\fR 

.sp
.LP
and bring the driver online again using \fBlibdevice\fR. 

.sp
.LP
To terminate testing, enter:

.sp
.LP
\fB#\fR \fBth_manage\fR \fBfoo\fR \fB0\fR \fBclear_errdefs\fR
