.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBzic\fR reads text from the file(s) named on the command line and creates the time conversion information files specified in this input. If a \fIfilename\fR is '\fB\(mi\fR\&', the standard input is read.
.sp
.LP
Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated by any number of white space characters. Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored. A pound sign (\fB#\fR) indicates a comment that extends to the end of the line. White space characters and pound signs can be enclosed within double quotes (\fB" "\fR) if they are to be used as part of a field. Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored. Non-blank lines are expected to be of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, or link lines.
.SS "Rule"
.sp
.LP
A rule line has the form:
.sp
.LP
For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Rule   NAME  FROM  TO  TYPE  IN   ON     AT   SAVE  LETTER/S
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The fields that make up a rule line are:
.sp
.in +2
.nf

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTYPE\fR\fR

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fByearistype\fR \fIyear\fR \fBtype\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

to check the type of a year: an exit status of \fB0\fR means that the year is of the given type; an exit status of \fB1\fR means that the year is not of the given type. The \fByearistype\fR command is not currently provided in the Solaris environment.

.RS 11n
.rt  
Time in hours, minutes, and seconds, where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day and hour 24 is midnight at the end of the day.
.RE

Any of these forms can be followed by the letter \fBw\fR if the given time is local "wall clock" time; \fBs\fR if the given time is local "standard" time; or \fBu\fR (or \fBg\fR or \fBz\fR) if the given time is universal time. In the absence of an indicator, wall clock time is assumed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSAVE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt

.ad
.RS 12n

.RE

.SS "Zone"
.sp
.LP
A zone line has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Zone  NAME                 GMTOFF  RULES/SAVE   FORMAT  [UNTIL]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf

.LP
The fields that make up a zone line are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNAME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The name of the time zone. This is the name used in creating the time conversion information file for the zone.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBGMTOFF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The amount of time to add to \fBUTC\fR to get standard time in this zone. This field has the same format as the \fBAT\fR and \fBSAVE\fR fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus sign to subtract time from \fBUTC\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBRULES/SAVE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone or, alternately, an amount of time to add to local standard time. If this field is `\fB\(mi\fR\&', then standard time always applies in the time zone.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFORMAT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone. The pair of characters \fB%s\fR is used to show where the "variable part" of the time zone abbreviation goes. Alternately, a slash (/) separates standard and daylight abbreviations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBUNTIL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The time at which the \fBUTC\fR offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It is specified as a year, a month, a day, and a time of day. The time of day has the same format as the \fBAT\fR field of rule lines. If this is specified, the time zone information is generated from the given \fBUTC\fR offset and rule change until the time specified.
.sp
The month, day, and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT columns of a rule; trailing columns can be omitted, and default to the earliest possible value for the missing columns.
.sp
The next line must be a "continuation" line. This line has the same form as a zone line except that the string "Zone" and the name are omitted. The continuation line places information starting at the time specified as the \fBUNTIL\fR field in the previous line in the file used by the previous line. Continuation lines can contain an \fBUNTIL\fR field, just as zone lines do, indicating that the next line is a further continuation.
.RE

.SS "Link"
.sp
.LP
A link line has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Link   LINK-FROM   LINK-TO
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Link   Europe/Istanbul Asia/Istanbul
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fBLINK-FROM\fR field should appear as the \fBNAME\fR field in some zone line; the \fBLINK-TO\fR field is used as an alternate name for that zone.
.sp
.LP
Except for continuation lines, lines can appear in any order in the input.

For areas with more than two types of local time, you might need to use local standard time in the \fBAT\fR field of the earliest transition time's rule to ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.

If the current \fItimezone\fR file is edited and compiled using the "\fBzic\fR" command, the changes will only be reflected in any new processes that are running.  The most accurate way to reflect the changes for the whole system would be a reboot.
