.SH NAME
auditreduce \- merge and select audit records from audit trail files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBauditreduce\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIaudit-trail-file\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBauditreduce\fR allows you to select or merge records from audit trail files. Audit files can be from one or more machines.
.sp
.LP
The merge function merges together audit records from one or more input audit trail files into a single output file. The records in an audit trail file are assumed to be sorted in chronological order (oldest first) and this order is maintained by \fBauditreduce\fR in the output file.
.sp
.LP
Unless instructed otherwise, \fBauditreduce\fR will merge the entire audit trail, which consists of all the audit trail files in the directory structure \fIaudit_root_dir\fR\fB/*\fR (see \fBaudit.log\fR(4) for details of the structure of the audit root). Unless specified with the -\fBR\fR or -\fBS\fR option, \fIaudit_root_dir\fR defaults to \fB/var/audit\fR. By using the file selection options it is possible to select some subset of these files, or files from another directory, or files named explicitly on the command line.
.sp
.LP
The select function allows audit records to be selected on the basis of numerous criteria relating to the record's content (see \fBaudit.log\fR(4) for details of record content). A record must meet all of the \fIrecord-selection-option\fR criteria to be selected.
.SS "Audit Trail Filename Format"
.sp
.LP
Any audit trail file not named on the command line must conform to the audit trail filename format. Files produced by the audit system already have this format. Output file names produced by \fBauditreduce\fR are in this format. It is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIstart-time\fR\fB\&.\fR\fI\|end-time\fR\fB\&.\fR\fI\|suffix\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIstart-time\fR is the 14-character timestamp of when the file was opened, \fIend-time\fR is the 14-character timestamp of when the file was closed, and \fIsuffix\fR is the name of the machine which generated the audit trail file, or some other meaningful suffix (for example, \fBall\fR, if the file contains a combined group of records from many machines). The \fIend-time\fR can be the literal string \fBnot_terminated\fR, to indicate that the file is still being written to by the audit system. Timestamps are of the form \fIyyyymmddhhmmss\fR (year, month, day, hour, minute, second). The timestamps are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "File Selection Options"
.sp
.LP
The file selection options indicate which files are to be processed and certain types of special treatment.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
All of the records from the input files will be selected regardless of their timestamp. This option effectively disables the \fB-a\fR, \fB-b\fR, and \fB-d\fR options. This is useful in preventing the loss of records if the \fB-D\fR option is used to delete the input files after they are processed. Note, however, that if a record is \fInot\fR selected due to another option, then \fB-A\fR will not override that.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Only process complete files. Files whose filename \fIend-time\fR timestamp is \fBnot_terminated\fR are not processed (such a file is currently being written to by the audit system). This is useful in preventing the loss of records if \fB-D\fR is used to delete the input files after they are processed. It does not apply to files specified on the command line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIsuffix\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Delete input files after they are read if the entire run is successful. If \fBauditreduce\fR detects an error while reading a file, then that file is not deleted. If \fB-D\fR is specified, \fB-A\fR, \fB-C\fR and \fB-O\fR are also implied. \fIsuffix\fR is given to the \fB-O\fR option. This helps prevent the loss of audit records by ensuring that all of the records are written, only complete files are processed, and the records are written to a file before being deleted. Note that if both \fB-D\fR and \fB-O\fR are specified in the command line, the order of specification is significant. The \fIsuffix\fR associated with the latter specification is in effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR \fImachine\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows selection of records from files with \fImachine\fR as the filename suffix. If \fB-M\fR is not specified, all files are processed regardless of suffix. \fB-M\fR can also be used to allow selection of records from files that contain combined records from many machines and have a common suffix (such as \fBall\fR).

Select objects in \fBnew mode\fR.This flag is off by default, thus retaining backward compatibility. In the existing, \fBold mode\fR, specifying the \fB-e\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-g\fR, \fB-r\fR, or \fB-u\fR flags would select not only actions taken with those \fBID\fRs, but also certain objects owned by those \fBID\fRs. When running in \fBnew mode\fR, only actions are selected. In order to select objects, the \fB-o\fR option must be used.

\fB\fB-O\fR \fIsuffix\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Direct output stream to a file in the current \fBaudit_root_dir\fR with the indicated suffix. \fIsuffix\fR can alternatively contain a full pathname, in which case the last component is taken as the suffix, ahead of which the timestamps will be placed, ahead of which the remainder of the pathname will be placed. If the \fB-O\fR option is not specified, the output is sent to the standard output. When \fBauditreduce\fR places timestamps in the filename, it uses the times of the first and last records in the merge as the \fIstart-time\fR and \fIend-time\fR.

Specify the pathname of an alternate audit root directory \fIaudit_root_dir\fR to be \fIpathname\fR. Therefore, rather than using \fB/var/audit\fR by default, \fIpathname\fR\fB/*\fR will be examined instead.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-S\fR \fIspecific_directory\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option causes \fBauditreduce\fR to read audit trail files from a specific location (\fIspecific_directory\fR). \fIspecific_directory\fR is normally interpreted as the name of a subdirectory of the audit root, therefore \fBauditreduce\fR will look in \fIaudit_root_dir\fR/\fIspecific_directory\fR for the audit trail files. But if \fIspecific_directory\fR contains any backslash characters (\fB/\fR), it is the name of a directory not necessarily contained in the audit root. In this case, \fIspecific_directory\fR will be consulted. This option allows archived files to be manipulated easily, without requiring that they be physically located in a directory structure like that of \fB/var/audit\fR.

Select records containing file system objects with the specified pathname, where pathname is a comma separated list of regular expressions. If a regular expression is preceded by a tilde (\fB~\fR), files matching the expression are excluded from the output. For example, the option \fBfile=~/usr/openwin,/usr,/etc\fR would select all files in \fB/usr\fR or \fB/etc\fR except those in \fB/usr/openwin\fR. The order of the regular expressions is important because auditreduce processes them from left to right, and stops when a file is known to be either selected or excluded. Thus the option \fBfile=\fR \fB/usr\fR, \fB/etc\fR, \fB~/usr/openwin\fR would select all files in \fB/usr\fR and all files in \fB/etc\fR. Files in \fB/usr/openwin\fR are not excluded because the regular expression \fB/usr\fR is matched first. Care should be given in surrounding the \fIpathname\fR with quotes so as to prevent the shell from expanding any tildes.

If activity for user \fBID\fR 9944 has been observed, but that user is not known to the system administrator, then the command in the following example searches the entire audit trail for any records generated by that user. \fBauditreduce\fR queries the system about the current validity of \fBID\fR 9944 and displays a warning message if it is not currently active:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBauditreduce -O /var/audit/audit_suspect/user9944 -u 9944\fR
.fi
.in -2

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
\fBauditreduce\fR displays error messages if there are command line errors and then exits. If there are fatal errors during the run, \fBauditreduce\fR displays an explanatory message and exits. In this case, the output file might be in an inconsistent state (no trailer or partially written record) and \fBauditreduce\fR displays a warning message before exiting. Successful invocation returns \fB0\fR and unsuccessful invocation returns \fB1\fR.
.sp
.LP
Since \fBauditreduce\fR might be processing a large number of input files, it is possible that the machine-wide limit on open files will be exceeded. If this happens, \fBauditreduce\fR displays a message to that effect, give information on how many file there are, and exit.
.sp
.LP
If \fBauditreduce\fR displays a record's timestamp in a diagnostic message, that time is in local time. However, when filenames are displayed, their timestamps are in \fBUTC\fR.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
Conjunction, disjunction, negation, and grouping of record selection options should be allowed.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fB-z\fR option should be used only if the audit policy \fBzonename\fR is set. If there is no zonename token, then no records will be selected.
