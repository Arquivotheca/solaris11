.SH NAME
in.mpathd \- IP multipathing daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/inet/in.mpathd\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.mpathd\fR daemon performs failure and repair detection for IP interfaces that have been placed into an IPMP group (or optionally, for all IP interfaces on the system). It also controls which IP interfaces in an IPMP group are "active" (being used by the system to send or receive IP data traffic) in a manner that is consistent with the administrator's configured policy. Functioning interfaces that are not active are referred to as \fBalternate\fR interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.mpathd\fR daemon can detect IP interface failure and repair through three methods: by monitoring the \fBIFF_RUNNING\fR flag for each IP interface (link-state based failure detection),  by sending and receiving ICMP probes on each IP interface (ICMP probe-based failure detection), or by transitive probing.  Failure detection by transitive probing is done by sending and receiving ICMP probes on active interfaces, while determining the liveness of alternate interfaces through their ability to send and receive link-layer (that is, transitive) probes to an active interface.
.sp
.LP
By default, only link-state based failure detection is enabled. This requires the driver to support link-status notification. ICMP probe-based failure detection must be enabled through the configuration of one or more test addresses, which are described below. Transitive probing can be enabled by modifying the value of the SMF property (shown below) to \fBtrue\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/ipmp/config/transitive-probing
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
See \fBEXAMPLES\fR for more information on how to modify the value of the \fBtransitive-probing\fR property.
.sp
.LP
Both ICMP and transitive probe-based failure detection methods test the entire IP interface send and receive path. The \fBipmpstat\fR(1M) utility can be used to check which failure detection methods are enabled.
.sp
.LP
If \fBtransitive-probing\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR, and no test addresses are configured for a given IPMP group, then transitive probing will be used. If it is set to \fBfalse\fR (default value), then transitive probing will not be used under any circumstance.
.sp
.LP
If only link-state based failure detection is enabled, then the health of the interface is determined solely from the state of the \fBIFF_RUNNING\fR flag. If probes have been enabled, the interface is  considered  failed  if  either  link-state or probes indicate a failure, and repaired once the failure detection method has indicated the failure has been corrected. Although all interfaces in a group need not be configured with the same failure detection methods, transitive probing will be disabled on any interface of a group that has at least one IP test address.
.sp
.LP
As mentioned above, to perform ICMP probe-based failure detection, \fBin.mpathd\fR requires a test address on each IP interface for the purpose of sending and receiving probes. Each address must be marked \fBNOFAILOVER\fR (see \fBifconfig\fR(1M)) and \fBin.mpathd\fR will be limited to probing targets on the same subnet. Each address may be configured statically or acquired by means of DHCP. To find targets, \fBin.mpathd\fR first consults the routing table for routes on the same subnet, and uses the specified next-hop. If no routes match, it sends all-hosts ICMP probes and selects a subset of the systems that respond. Thus, for probe-based failure detection to operate, there must be at least one neighbor on each subnet that responds to ICMP echo request probes. The  \fBipmpstat\fR(1M)  utility can be used to display both the current probe target information and the status of sent probes.
.sp
.LP
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. If an IP interface is plumbed for IPv4 and an IPv4 test address is configured then \fBin.mpathd\fR will start sending ICMPv4 probes over that IP interface. Similarly, if an IP interface is plumbed for IPv6 and an IPv6 test address is configured, then \fBin.mpathd\fR will start sending ICMPv6 probes over that IP interface. However, note that \fBin.mpathd\fR will ignore IPv6 test addresses that are not link-local. If both IPv4 and IPv6 are plumbed, it is sufficient to configure only one of the two, that is, either an IPv4 test address or an IPv6 test address. If both IPv4 and IPv6 test addresses are configured, \fBin.mpathd\fR probes using both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.
.sp
.LP
As mentioned above, \fBin.mpathd\fR also controls which IP interfaces in an IPMP group are "active" (used by the system to send and receive IP data traffic). Specifically, \fBin.mpathd\fR tracks the administrative configuration of each IPMP group and attempts to keep the number of active IP interfaces in each group consistent with that configuration. Therefore, if an active IP interface fails, \fBin.mpathd\fR will activate an \fBINACTIVE\fR interface in the group, provided one exists (it will prefer \fBINACTIVE\fR interfaces that are also marked \fBSTANDBY\fR). Likewise, if an IP interface repairs and the resulting repair leaves the IPMP group with more active interfaces than the administrative configuration specifies, \fBin.mpathd\fR will deactivate one of the interfaces (preferably one marked \fBSTANDBY\fR), except when the \fBFAILBACK\fR variable is used, as described below. Similar adjustments will be made by \fBin.mpathd\fR when offlining IP interfaces (for instance, in response to \fBif_mpadm\fR(1M)).
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.mpathd\fR daemon accesses three variable values in \fB/etc/default/mpathd\fR: \fBFAILURE_DETECTION_TIME\fR, \fBFAILBACK\fR and \fBTRACK_INTERFACES_ONLY_WITH_GROUPS\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBFAILURE_DETECTION_TIME\fR variable specifies the probe-based failure detection time. The shorter the failure detection time, the more probe traffic. The default value of \fBFAILURE_DETECTION_TIME\fR is 10 seconds. This means that IP interface failure will be detected by \fBin.mpathd\fR within 10 seconds. The IP interface repair detection time is always twice the value of \fBFAILURE_DETECTION_TIME\fR. Note that failures and repairs detected by link-based failure detection are acted on immediately, though \fBin.mpathd\fR may ignore link state changes if it suspects that the link state is flapping due to defective hardware; see \fBDIAGNOSTICS\fR.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBin.mpathd\fR limits failure and repair detection to IP interfaces that are configured as part of a named IPMP group. Setting \fBTRACK_INTERFACES_ONLY_WITH_GROUPS\fR to \fBno\fR enables failure and repair detection on all IP interfaces, even if they are not part of a named IPMP group. IP interfaces that are tracked but not part of a named IPMP group are considered to be part of the "anonymous" IPMP group. In addition to having no name, this IPMP group is special in that its IP interfaces are not equivalent and thus cannot take over for one another in the event of an IP interface failure. That is, the anonymous IPMP group can only be used for failure and repair detection, and provides no high-availability or load-spreading.
.sp
.LP
As described above, when \fBin.mpathd\fR detects that an IP interface has repaired, it activates it so that it will again be used to send and receive IP data traffic. However, if \fBFAILBACK\fR is set to \fBno\fR, then the IP interface will only be activated if no other active IP interfaces in the group remain. However, the interface may subsequently be activated if another IP interface in the group fails.
.SS "SMF Management"
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.mpathd\fR daemon service is managed by the service  management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp

IP interface \fIinterface_name\fR has a hardware address which is not unique in group \fIgroup_name\fR; offlining
.RS +4
\fBDescription: \fR
.sp
.LP
For probe-based failure detection, load-spreading, and other code IPMP features to work properly, each IP interface in an IPMP group must have a unique hardware address. If this requirement is not met, \fBin.mpathd\fR will automatically offline all but one of the IP interfaces with duplicate hardware addresses.

IP \fIinterface_name\fR in group \fIgroup_name\fR is not plumbed for IPv[4|6], affecting IPv[4|6] connectivity
.RS +4
\fBDescription: \fR
.sp
.LP
All IP interfaces in a multipathing group must be homogeneously plumbed. For example, if one IP interface is plumbed for IPv4, then all IP interfaces in the group must be plumbed for IPv4, or IPv4 packets will not be able to be reliably sent and received. The STREAMS modules pushed on all IP interfaces must also be identical.

.RS +4
\fBDescription: \fR
.sp
.LP
The round trip time for \fBICMP\fR probes is higher than necessary to maintain the current failure detection time. The network is probably congested or the probe targets are loaded. \fBin.mpathd\fR automatically increases the failure detection time to whatever it can achieve under these conditions.
