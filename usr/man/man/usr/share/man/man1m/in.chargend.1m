.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Manager. See \fBfmd\fR(1M) and \fBsmf\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.chargend\fR service provides the server-side of the character-generator protocol. This protocol is used for debugging and bandwidth measurement and is available on both TCP and UDP transports, through port 19.
.sp
.LP
The in.chargend service is an \fBinetd\fR(1M) \fBsmf\fR(5) delegated service. The \fBin.chargend\fR detects which transport is requested by examining the socket it is passed by the \fBinetd\fR daemon.

Once a connection is established, the \fBin.chargend\fR generates a stream of data. Any data received is discarded. The server generates data until the client program terminates the connection. Note that the data flow is limited by TCP flow control mechanisms.

\fBUDP-based service\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The \fBin.chargend\fR listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server generates a UDP datagram in response containing a random number of ASCII characters (ranging from 0 to 512 characters). Any received data is ignored.

.LP
The \fBin.chargend\fR data consists of a pattern of 72 character lines containing the printable, 7-bit ASCII characters. Each line is terminated with a carriage return and a line feed character.
