.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpsrset\fR utility controls the management of processor sets. Processor sets allow the binding of processes or LWPs to groups of processors, rather than just a single processor. Processors assigned to processor sets can run only LWPs that have been bound to that processor set.
.sp
.LP
This command cannot be used to modify processor disposition when pools are enabled. Use \fBpooladm\fR(1M) and \fBpoolcfg\fR(1M) to modify processor set configuration through the resource pools facility.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Assign the specified processors to the specified processor set. With the additional \fB-F\fR option, all LWPs bound to the specified processors will be unbound prior to changing processor sets.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Bind all or a subset of the \fBLWP\fRs of the specified processes to the specified processor set.
.sp
LWPs bound to a processor set are restricted to run only on the processors in that set. Processes can only be bound to non-empty processor sets, that is, processor sets that have had processors assigned to them.
.sp
Bindings are inherited, so new LWPs and processes created by a bound LWP have the same binding. Binding an interactive shell to a processor, for example, binds all commands executed by the shell.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Create a new processor set and displays the new processor set \fBID\fR. With the additional \fB-F\fR option, all LWPs bound to the specified processors will be unbound prior to assigning them to the processor set being created.
.sp
If a list of processors is given, it also attempts to assign those processors to the processor set. If this succeeds, the processors are idle until \fBLWP\fRs are bound to the processor set. This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.sp
Only a limited number of processor sets can be active (created and not destroyed) at a given time. This limit is always be greater than the number of processors in the system. If the \fB-c\fR option is used when the maximum number of processor sets is already active, the command fails.
.sp
The following format is used for the first line of output of the \fB-c\fR option when the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR locale category specifies the "C" locale. In other locales, the strings \fBcreated\fR, \fBprocessor\fR, and \fBset\fR can be replaced with more appropriate strings corresponding to the locale.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Remove the specified processor set, releasing all processors and processes associated with it.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Execute a command (with optional arguments) in the specified processor set.
.sp
The command process and any child processes are executed only by processors in the processor set.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Disables interrupts for all processors within the specified processor set. See \fBpsradm\fR(1M).
.sp
If some processors in the set cannot have their interrupts disabled, the other processors still have their interrupts disabled, and the command reports an error and return non-zero exit status.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Forces the specified processor set operation by unbinding all threads bound to the specified processor. Only the \fB-a\fR or the \fB-r\fR option can be used in combination with this option. Administrators are encouraged to use the \fB-Q\fR option for \fBpbind\fR(1M) to find out which threads will be affected by such operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display a list of processors assigned to each named processor set. If no argument is given, a list of all processor sets and the processors assigned to them is displayed. This is also the default operation if the \fBpsrset\fR command is not given an option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Enable interrupts for all processors within the specified processor set. See \fBpsradm\fR(1M).
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display the processor set assignments for the specified list of processors. If no argument is given, the processor set assignments for all processors in the system is given.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display the processor set bindings of the specified processes or of all processes. If a process is composed of multiple \fBLWP\fRs which have different bindings and the LWPs are not explicitly specified, the bindings of only one of the bound \fBLWP\fRs is displayed. The bindings of a subset of LWPs can be displayed by appending "/lwpids" to the process \fBID\fRs. Multiple LWPs may be selected using "-" and "," delimiters. See EXAMPLES.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-Q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display the LWPs bound to the specified list of processor sets, or all LWPs with processor set bindings.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Remove a list of processors from their current processor sets. Processors that are removed return to the general pool of processors.
.sp
Processors with \fBLWP\fRs bound to them using \fBpbind\fR(1M) can be assigned to or removed from processor sets using the \fB-F\fR option.
.sp
This option is restricted to users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Remove the processor set bindings of a subset or all the \fBLWP\fRs of the specified processes, allowing them to be executed on any on-line processor if they are not bound to individual processors through \fBpbind\fR.
.sp
Users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege can unbind any process or LWP from any active processor set. Other users can unbind processes and LWPs from processor sets that do not have the \fBPSET_NOESCAPE\fR attribute set. In addition, the user must have permission to control the affected processes; the real or effective user ID of the user must match the real or saved user ID of the target processes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Removes the bindings of all LWPs bound to the specified list of processor sets, or to any processor set if no argument is specified.
