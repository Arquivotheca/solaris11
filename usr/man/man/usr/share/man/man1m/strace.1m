.SH NAME
strace \- print STREAMS trace messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBstrace\fR [\fImid\fR \fIsid\fR \fIlevel\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBstrace\fR without arguments writes all STREAMS event trace messages from all drivers and modules to its standard output. These messages are obtained from the STREAMS log driver (see \fBlog\fR(7D)). If arguments are provided, they must be in triplets of the form \fImid, sid, level\fR, where \fImid\fR is a STREAMS module  \fBID\fR number, \fIsid\fR is a sub-ID number,  and \fIlevel\fR is a tracing priority level. Each triplet indicates that tracing messages are to be received from the given module/driver, sub-ID (usually indicating minor device), and priority level equal to, or less than the given level. The token \fBall\fR may be used for any member to indicate no restriction for that attribute.

The format of each trace message output is:
.sp
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRA sample output of the \fBstrace\fR command:
.sp
.LP
The following example outputs all trace messages from the module or driver whose module  \fBID\fR is  \fB41\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBstrace  41 all all\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example outputs those trace messages from driver or module  \fBID\fR \fB41\fR with  sub-IDs \fB0\fR, \fB1\fR, or  \fB2\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBstrace  41 0 1  41 1 1  41 2 0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Messages from sub-IDs  \fB0\fR and  \fB1\fR must have  a tracing level less than or equal to  \fB1\fR. Those from sub-ID  \fB2\fR must have a tracing level of  \fB0\fR.

.SH NOTES

There is no restriction to the number of \fBstrace\fR processes opening the  \fBSTREAMS\fR log driver at a time.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The log-driver records the list of the triplets specified in the command invocation, and compares each potential trace message against this list to decide if it should be formatted and sent up to the \fBstrace\fR process. Hence, long lists of triplets will have a greater impact on overall STREAMS performance. Running \fBstrace\fR will have the most impact on the timing of the modules and  drivers generating the trace messages that are sent to the \fBstrace\fR process. If trace messages are generated faster than the \fBstrace\fR process can handle them,  some of the messages will be lost. This last case can be determined by examining the sequence numbers on the trace messages output.
