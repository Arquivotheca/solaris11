.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpsradm\fR utility changes the operational status of processors. The legal states for the processor are \fBon-line\fR, \fBoff-line\fR, \fBspare\fR, \fBfaulted\fR, and \fBno-intr\fR.
.sp
.LP
An \fBon-line\fR processor processes \fBLWPs\fR (lightweight processes) and can be interrupted by I/O devices in the system.
.sp
.LP
An \fBoff-line\fR processor does not process any \fBLWPs.\fR Usually, an \fBoff-line\fR processor is not interruptible by I/O devices in the system. On some processors or under certain conditions, it might not be possible to disable interrupts for an \fBoff-line\fR processor. Thus, the actual effect of being \fBoff-line\fR might vary from machine to machine.
.sp
.LP
A spare processor does not process any LWPs. A spare processor can be brought \fBon-line\fR, \fBoff-line\fR or to \fBno-intr\fR by a privileged user of the system or by the kernel in response to changes in the system state. 
.sp
.LP
A faulted processor is identified by the kernel, which monitors the behavior of processors over time. A privileged user can set the state of a faulted processor to be \fBon-line\fR, \fBoff-line\fR, \fBspare\fR or \fBno-intr\fR, but must use the force option to do so.
.sp
.LP
A \fBno-intr\fR processor processes \fBLWPs\fR but is not interruptible by I/O devices.
.sp
.LP
A processor can not be taken \fBoff-line\fR or made \fBspare\fR if there are LWPs that are bound to the processor unless the additional \fB-F\fR option is used. The \fB-F\fR option removes processor bindings of such LWPs before changing the processor's operational status. On some architectures, it might not be possible to take certain processors \fBoff-line\fR or \fBspare\fR if, for example, the system depends on some resource provided by the processor. 
.sp
.LP
At least one processor in the system must be able to process \fBLWPs.\fR At least one processor must also be able to be interrupted. Since an \fBoff-line\fR or \fBspare\fR processor can be interruptible, it is possible to have an operational system with one processor \fBno-intr\fR and all other processors \fBoff-line\fR or \fBspare\fR but with one or more accepting interrupts. 
.sp
.LP
If any of the specified processors are powered off, \fBpsradm\fR might power on one or more processors.
.sp
.LP
Only users with the \fBPRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG\fR privilege can use the \fBpsradm\fR utility.

\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Force the transition to the additional specified state. Required if one or more of the specified processors was in the faulted state. Set the specified processors to faulted, if no other transition option was specified. Forced transitions can only be made to \fBfaulted\fR, \fBspare\fR, or \fBoff-line\fR states. Administrators are encouraged to use the \fB-Q\fR option for \fBpbind\fR(1M) to find out which threads will be affected by forced a processor state transition.
