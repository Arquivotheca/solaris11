.SH NAME
inityp2l \- create NIS (YP) to LDAP configuration files
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBinityp2l\fR utility assists with creation of the \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR and \fBypserv\fR files. See \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR(4) and\fBypserv\fR(4). \fBinityp2l\fR examines the NIS maps on a system. and through a dialogue with the user, determines which NIS to (and from) LDAP mappings are required. A \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR file is then created based on this information. The utility asks users about their LDAP server configuration and a \fBypserv\fR file is created based on this information.
.sp
.LP
The \fBinityp2l\fR utility handles mappings for standard NIS maps and the \fBauto.*\fR series of maps. If requested, it creates default mappings for custom maps, with each map entry represented as a single DIT string. \fBinityp2l\fR does not handle full custom mapping, but if requested, \fBinityp2l\fR will insert comments into the \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR file that indicate where these should be added.

.LP
To write to the \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR or \fBypserv\fR files is potentially dangerous. \fBinityp2l\fR warns the user and asks for confirmation before:

it overwrites either file

2.
it writes to the default \fBNISLDAPmapping\fR file location, if this file did not previously exist. This is important because the existence of a file in this location causes NIS components to work NIS to LDAP (N2L)  mode when next restarted, rather than to traditional NIS mode.

\fBinityp2l\fR assists with rapid creation of a simple N2L configuration files. It is not a general purpose tool for the		management of these files. An advanced user who would like to maintain the files or use custom mappings should examine the output of \fBinityp2l\fR and customize it by using a standard text editor.
