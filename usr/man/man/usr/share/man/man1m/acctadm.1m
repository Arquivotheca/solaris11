The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIresource_list\fR\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable accounting of the given operand type without closing the accounting file. This option can be used to temporarily stop writing accounting records to the accounting file without closing it. To close the file use the \fB-x\fR option. See \fB-x\fR.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBtask\fR\fR

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Both extended accounting and regular accounting can be active.
.sp
.LP
Available resources can vary from system to system, and from platform to platform.
.sp
.LP
Extended accounting configuration is stored in the service management facility (\fBsmf\fR(5)) repository. The configuration is restored at boot by a transient service instance, one per accounting type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/extended-accounting:flow        Flow accounting
svc:/system/extended-accounting:process     Process accounting
svc:/system/extended-accounting:task        Task accounting
svc:/system/extended-accounting:net         Network accounting
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The instances are enabled or disabled by \fBacctadm\fR as needed. Configuration changes are made using \fBacctadm\fR; service properties should not be modified directly using \fBsvccfg\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Users can manage extended accounting (start accounting, stop accounting, change accounting configuration parameters) if they have the appropriate RBAC Rights profile for the accounting type to be managed:
