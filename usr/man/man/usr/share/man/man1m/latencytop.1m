.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
LatencyTOP is an observability tool that reports statistics about latencies in the system and in applications. The tool reports statistics about where and what kind of latencies are happening in the system and in the applications that are running on the system. The statistics then can be used to improve performance throughput of applications and system, as you remove the identified latencies.
.sp
.LP
The tool analyzes system activity periodically and displays the data in the output window. Two types of latencies are tracked: an LWP going in and out of sleep and an LWP spinning order to acquire a synchronization object. The tool uses the Solaris DTrace framework to collect the statistics corresponding to these two scenarios of inactivity of the system and application LWPs.
.sp
.LP
The output window is divided into two sections. An upper part displays the system-wide statistics, while the lower part displays statistics about individual processes. The user can navigate the list of processes (using the left- and right-arrow keys) and select the list they are interested in. The tool will then display statistics about that selected process in the lower part of the window. If the t or T key is pressed, the tool displays the LWP-specific view of that selected process. The t or T key can be used to toggle between the process-view and the thread-view.
.sp
.LP
During execution, a user can force a refresh of the analysis by pressing the r or R key. The interval time is restored to the default or to a specified value (if -t was used). To quit the application, the user must press the q or Q key.
