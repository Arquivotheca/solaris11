.SH NAME
rpcbind \- universal addresses to RPC program number mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBrpcbind\fR [\fB-d\fR] [\fB-w\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpcbind\fR is a server that converts \fBRPC\fR program numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on the host to be able to make \fBRPC\fR calls on a server on that machine.
.sp
.LP
When an \fBRPC\fR service is started, it tells \fBrpcbind\fR the address at which it is listening, and the \fBRPC\fR program numbers it is prepared to serve. When a client wishes to make an \fBRPC\fR call to a given program number, it first contacts \fBrpcbind\fR on the server machine to determine the address where \fBRPC\fR requests should be sent.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpcbind\fR should be started before any other \fBRPC\fR service. Normally, standard \fBRPC\fR servers are started by port monitors, so \fBrpcbind\fR must be started before port monitors are invoked.
.sp
.LP
When \fBrpcbind\fR is started, it checks that certain name-to-address translation-calls function correctly. If they fail, the network configuration databases can be corrupt. Since \fBRPC\fR services cannot function correctly in this situation, \fBrpcbind\fR reports the condition and terminates.
.sp
.LP
\fBrpcbind\fR maintains an open transport end for each transport that it uses for indirect calls. This is the \fBUDP\fR port on most systems.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrpcbind\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/rpc/bind
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). \fBrpcbind\fR can only be started by the superuser or someone in the Primary Administrator role.
.sp
.LP
The configuration properties of this service can be modified with \fBsvccfg\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The following SMF property is used to allow or disallow access to \fBrpcbind\fR by remote clients:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
config/local_only = true
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The default value, \fBtrue\fR, shown above, disallows remote access; a value of \fBfalse\fR allows remove access. See EXAMPLES.
.sp
.LP
The FMRI \fBsvc:network/rpc/bind\fR property group \fBconfig\fR contains the following property settings:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBenable_tcpwrappers\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Specifies that the TCP wrappers facility is used to control access to TCP services. The value \fBtrue\fR enables checking. The default value for \fBenable_tcpwrappers\fR is \fBfalse\fR. If the \fBenable_tcpwrappers\fR parameter is enabled, then all calls to \fBrpcbind\fR originating from non-local addresses are automatically wrapped by the TCP wrappers facility. The \fBsyslog\fR facility code daemon is used to log allowed connections (using the \fBinfo\fR severity level) and denied traffic (using the \fBwarning\fR severity level). See \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4) for a description of \fBsyslog\fR codes and severity levels. The Interface Stability of the TCP wrappers facility and its configuration files is Volatile. As the TCP wrappers facility is not controlled by Sun, intrarelease incompatibilities are not uncommon. See \fBattributes\fR(5).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBverbose_logging\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Specifies whether the TCP wrappers facility logs all calls orjust the denied calls. The default is \fBfalse\fR. This option has no effect if TCP wrappers are not enabled.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBallow_indirect\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Specifies whether \fBrpcbind\fR allows indirect calls at all. By default, \fBrpcbind\fR allows most indirect calls, except to a number of standard services(\fBkeyserv\fR, \fBautomount\fR, \fBmount\fR, \fBnfs\fR, \fBrquota\fR, and selected NIS and \fBrpcbind\fR procedures). Setting \fBallow_indirect\fR to \fBfalse\fR causes all indirect calls to be dropped. The default is \fBtrue\fR. NIS broadcast clients rely on this functionality on NIS servers.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Run in debug mode. In this mode, \fBrpcbind\fR does not fork when it starts. It prints additional information during operation, and aborts on certain errors. With this option, the name-to-address translation consistency checks are shown in detail.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Do a warm start. If \fBrpcbind\fR aborts or terminates on \fBSIGINT\fR or \fB\fR\fBSIGTERM\fR, it writes the current list of registered services to \fB/var/run/portmap.file\fR and \fB/var/run/rpcbind.file\fR. Starting \fBrpcbind\fR with the \fB-w\fR option instructs it to look for these files and start operation with the registrations found in them. This allows \fBrpcbind\fR to resume operation without requiring all \fBRPC\fR services to be restarted.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Terminating \fBrpcbind\fR with \fBSIGKILL\fR prevents the warm-start files from being written.
.sp
.LP
All \fBRPC\fR servers are restarted if the following occurs: \fBrpcbind\fR crashes (or is killed with \fBSIGKILL)\fR and is unable to to write the warm-start files; \fBrpcbind\fR is started without the \fB-w\fR option after a graceful termination. Otherwise, the warm start files are not found by \fBrpcbind\fR.
