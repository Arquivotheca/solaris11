.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpbind\fR controls and queries bindings of processes and LWPs (lightweight processes) to processors. \fBpbind\fR can also remove processor bindings that were previously established.
.sp
.LP
When an LWP is bound to a processor, it will be executed only by that processor except when the LWP requires a resource that is provided only by another processor. The binding is not exclusive, that is, the processor is free to execute other LWPs as well.
.sp
.LP
Bindings are inherited, so new LWPs and processes created by a bound LWP will have the same binding. Binding an interactive shell to a processor, for example, binds all commands executed by the shell.
.sp
.LP
Superusers may bind or unbind any process or LWP, while other users can bind or unbind any process or LWP for which they have permission to signal, that is, any process that has the same effective user ID as the user.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fIprocessor_id\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Binds all or a subset of the LWPs of the specified processes to the processor \fIprocessor_id\fR. Specify \fIprocessor_id\fR as the processor \fBID\fR of the processor to be controlled or queried. \fIprocessor_id\fR must be present and on-line. Use the \fBpsrinfo\fR command to determine whether or not \fIprocessor_id\fR is present and on-line. See \fBpsrinfo\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays the bindings of the specified processes or of all processes. If a process is composed of multiple LWPs which have different bindings and the LWPs are not explicitly specified, the bindings of only one of the bound LWPs will be displayed. The bindings of a subset of LWPs can be displayed by appending "/lwpids" to the process \fBID\fRs. Multiple LWPs may be selected using "-" and "," delimiters. See EXAMPLES.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays the LWPs bound to the specified list of processors, or all LWPs with processor bindings. For processes composed of multiple LWPs, the bindings of individual LWPs will be displayed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRBinding Processes
.sp
.LP
The following example binds processes 204 and 223 to processor 2:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpbind -b 2 204 223\fR
process id 204: was 2, now 2
process id 223: was 3, now 2

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRUnbinding a Process
.sp
.LP
The following example unbinds process 204:

.sp
.in +2

example% \fBpbind -u 204\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRQuerying Bindings
.sp
.LP
The following example queries bindings. It demonstrates that process 1 is bound to processor 0, process 149 has at least one LWP bound to CPU3, and process 101 has no bound LWPs.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpbind -q 1 149 101\fR
process id 1: 0
process id 149: 3
process id 101: not bound
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRQuerying LWP Bindings
.sp
.LP
The following example queries bindings of LWPs. It demonstrates that LWP 1 of process 149 is bound to CPU3, and LWP 2 of process 149 is not bound.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpbind -q 149/1-2\fR
lwp id 149/1: 3
lwp id 149/2: not bound
