.SH NAME
ipnat \- user interface to the NAT subsystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBipnat\fR [\fB-CdFhlnRrsv\fR] \fB-f\fR \fIfilename\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipnat\fR utility opens a specified file (treating \fB-\fR as stdin) and parses it for a set of rules that are to be added or removed from the IP NAT.
.sp
.LP
If there are no parsing problems, each rule processed by \fBipnat\fR is added to the kernel's internal lists. Rules are appended to the internal lists, matching the order in which they appear when given to \fBipnat\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBipnat\fR's use is restricted through access to \fB/dev/ipauth\fR, \fB/dev/ipl\fR, and \fB/dev/ipstate\fR. The default permissions of these files require \fBipnat\fR to be run as root for all operations.
