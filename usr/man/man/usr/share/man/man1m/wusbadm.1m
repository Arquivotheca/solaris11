.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwusbadm\fR command provides a command line interface to administer wireless USB hosts and devices, including listing hosts and devices information, associating the host with the device, removing host or device information from the system, and enabling or disabling hosts.
.sp
.LP
Before connecting a wireless USB device to a host for the first time, a user needs to set up the association information between them by running the wusbadm associate subcommand. Following this, the user can  connect or disconnect the device by simply turning on or off the device radio (perhaps a button on the device, depending on the manufacturer). The device radio's turning on and off are analogous to the hotplugging of wired USB devices.
.sp
.LP
The association information created by the \fBassociate\fR subcommand is maintained in the non-volatile memory of the device and the host. On the host, it can be removed by the \fBremove-dev\fR or \fBremove-host\fR subcommands. On the device, it can be overwritten by another association. For a device is associated with multiple hosts, the way that the device prioritizes or updates its multiple records of association depends on the manufacturer.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBwusbadm\fR subcommand operates on one of the following objects:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIhost-id\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A two-digit number (in the range from 01 to 99) that  uniquely identifies a wireless USB host on a system. It is generated when the \fBwusb\fR service (see \fBNOTES\fR section) is successfully enabled and finds the host instance for the first time. The number is maintained until removed by \fBremove-host\fR subcommand.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdev-id\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A five-digit number that uniquely identifies a wireless USB device associated with a wireless USB host. The first two digits are the host-id of the wireless USB host with which the device is associated. The last three-digit number (in the range from 001 to 999) is used to differentiate devices associated with the same host. In the five-digit number, the first two digits and the last three are separated by a dot.
.sp
\fIdev-id\fR is generated during the device association process. It is maintained for the device until removed by the \fBremove-dev\fR subcommand or until updated by another association between the same host and device.

\fB\fBdisabled\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The host is not ready to work with any devices and no devices are connected to the host. It might be stopped by a \fBdisable-host\fR subcommand, or the host might not be available because it is physically unplugged or because of a driver detach.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdisconnected\fR\fR

.RE

There are the folllowing states for the device:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBconnected\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The device is connected with a host and ready to be opened, or it is already opened and working. By default, the device tries to get into this state after the association is complete and its radio is turned on.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdisconnected\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

There are two association models:
.sp

\fBCable association\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A user connects the device and host with a USB cable first, and then run this subcommand to designate the host to setup the association information with the device. After the association is in effect, the cable is no longer needed in the subsequent connections between the same host and the device.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fBNumeric association\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A user turns on the device radio and runs this subcommand to designate the host to talk to the device. A short number is then displayed on both host and device. The user compares the values of the numbers and confirms on both the host and the device.
.RE

Following a successful association, the associated USB host and device are able to proceed with the wireless connection process. By default, the association information will be kept both on the host and the device until it is removed or overwritten.
.sp
If there are multiple devices available for association, this subcommand will list all of them, enabling a user to choose among them. This subcommand has the following options.

Remove the host information from the system, including \fIhost-id\fR and the association information of all the devices associated with the host. This subcommand is used most often for removing the temporarily used hot-pluggable wireless USB host, for example, a \fBhwa\fR dongle. The host can be brought back by being re-enumerated, for example, physically hot-plugging a \fBhwa\fR dongle. The host-id will then be updated and no device association information can be restored. It is not recommended to remove a on-board host. This subcommand has the following options.
