.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgadd\fR transfers the contents of a software package from the distribution medium or directory to install it onto the system. Used without the \fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR source specifier, \fBpkgadd\fR looks in the default spool directory (\fB/var/spool/pkg\fR) for the package. Used with the \fB-s\fR option, it writes the package to a spool directory instead of installing it.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpkgadd\fR utility requires an amount of temporary space the size of the package that is being installed. \fBpkgadd\fR determines which temporary directory to use by checking for the existance of the \fB$TMPDIR\fR environment variable. If \fB$TMPDIR\fR is not defined, \fBpkgadd\fR uses \fBP_tmpdir\fR from \fBstdio.h\fR. \fBP_tmpdir\fR has a default of \fB/var/tmp/\fR.
.sp
.LP
Certain unbundled and third-party packages are no longer entirely compatible with the latest version of \fBpkgadd\fR. These packages require user interaction throughout the installation and not just at the very beginning, or require that their request scripts be run as the root user.
.sp
.LP
To install these older packages (released prior to Solaris 2.4), set the following environment variable: \fBNONABI_SCRIPTS=TRUE\fR
.sp
.LP
As long as this environment variable is set, \fBpkgadd\fR permits keyboard interaction throughout the installation and package request scripts are run as \fBroot\fR.
.sp
.LP
If you have package request scripts that require running as user \fBroot\fR (instead of \fBnoaccess\fR [the default] or user \fBinstall\fR), use the \fBrscript_alt\fR parameter in the \fBadmin\fR(4) file to make an appropriate selection. See \fBadmin\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
Note that, in Solaris 8 and Solaris 9, the default user when running a request script was either \fBroot\fR or \fBnobody\fR, depending on the operating system's patch level. In the current release, the default user is \fBnoaccess\fR.
.sp
.LP
When running \fBpkgadd\fR in the global zone (see \fBzones\fR(5)), a package that contains a request script (see \fBpkgask\fR(1M)) is added only to the global zone. The package is not propagated to any current or yet-to-be-installed non-global zone. This behavior mimics the effect of the \fB-G\fR option, described below.
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR, \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-d\fR, \fB-Y\fR, and \fIpkginst\fR arguments shown in the SYNOPSIS are described under OPERANDS, following OPTIONS.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The supported options are described as follows. The \fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR source specifier is described under OPERANDS, below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-a\fR \fIadmin\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Define an installation administration file, \fIadmin\fR, to be used in place of the default administration file. The token \fBnone\fR overrides the use of any \fIadmin\fR file, and thus forces interaction with the user. Unless a full path name is given, \fBpkgadd\fR first looks in the current working directory for the administration file. If the specified administration file is not in the current working directory, \fBpkgadd\fR looks in the \fB/var/sadm/install/admin\fR directory for the administration file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-G\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add package(s) in the current zone only. When used in the global zone, the package is added to the global zone only and is not propagated to any existing or yet-to-be-created non-global zone. When used in a non-global zone, the package(s) are added to the non-global zone only.
.sp
This option causes package installation to fail if, in the \fBpkginfo\fR file for a package, \fBSUNW_PKG_ALLZONES\fR is set to true. See \fBpkginfo\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIkeystore\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use \fIkeystore\fR as the location from which to get trusted certificate authority certificates when verifying digital signatures found in packages. If no keystore is specified, then the default keystore locations are searched for valid trusted certificates. See \fBKEYSTORE LOCATIONS\fR for more information.

\fB\fB\fR\fB-r\fR \fIresponse\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Identify a file or directory which contains output from a previous \fBpkgask\fR(1M) session. This file supplies the interaction responses that would be requested by the package in interactive mode. \fIresponse\fR must be a full pathname.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Define the full path name of a directory to use as the \fIroot_path\fR. All files, including package system information files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified \fIroot_path\fR. The \fIroot_path\fR may be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example, \fB/export/root/client1\fR).
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a HTTP[S] proxy to use when downloading packages The format of proxy is \fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR, where \fIhost\fR is the hostname of the HTTP[S] proxy, and \fIport\fR is the port number associated with the proxy. This switch overrides all other methods of specifying a proxy. See ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES for more information on alternate methods of specifying a default proxy.
.RE

.sp
.LP
When executed without options or operands, \fBpkgadd\fR uses \fB/var/spool/pkg\fR (the default spool directory).
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.SS "Sources"
.sp
.LP
By default, pkgadd looks in the \fB/var/spool/pkg\fR directory when searching for instances of a package to install or spool. Optionally, the source for the package instances to be installed or spooled can be specified using:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdatastream\fR \fIpkgname\fR,... | \fBall\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Install or copy a package from \fIdevice\fR. \fIdevice\fR can be any of the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A full path name to a directory or the identifiers for tape or removable medium (for example, \fB/var/tmp\fR).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A datastream created by \fBpkgtrans\fR (see \fBpkgtrans\fR(1)).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A URL pointing to a datastream created by \fBpkgtrans\fR. The supported Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) are \fBhttp:\fR and \fBhttps:\fR.
.RE
The second form of the \fB-d\fR specifier, above, indicates the syntax you use when specifying a datastream. In this case you must specify either a comma-separated list of package names or the keyword \fBall\fR.
.RE

.SS "Instances"
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpkgadd\fR searches the specified source, and presents an interactive menu allowing the user to select which package instances found on the source are to be installed. As an alternative, the package instances to be installed can be specified using:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpkginst\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The package instance or list of instances to be installed. The token \fBall\fR may be used to refer to all packages available on the source medium. The format \fIpkginst\fR\fB\&.*\fR can be used to indicate all instances of a package.
.sp
The asterisk character (\fB*\fR) is a special character to some shells and may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, the asterisk must be surrounded by single quotes (\fB\&'\fR) or preceded by a backslash (\fB\e\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-Y\fR \fIcategory\fR[,\fIcategory\fR...]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Install packages based on the value of the \fBCATEGORY\fR parameter stored in the package's \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. All packages on the source medium whose \fBCATEGORY\fR matches one of the specified categories will be selected for installation or spooling.
.RE

.SH KEYSTORE LOCATIONS
.sp
.LP
Package such as \fBpkgadd\fR use a set of trusted certificates to perform signature validation on any signatures found within the packages. If there are no signatures included in the packages then signature validation is skipped. The certificates can come from a variety of locations. If \fB-k\fR \fIkeystore\fR is specified, and \fIkeystore\fR is a directory, then \fIkeystore\fR is assumed to be the base directory of the certificates to be used. If \fIkeystore\fR is a file, then the file itself is assumed to have all required keys and certificates. When \fB-k\fR is not specified, then \fB/var/sadm/security\fR is used as the base directory.
.sp
.LP
Within the specified base directory, the store locations to be searched are different based on the application doing the searching and the type of store being searched for. The following directories are searched in the specified order:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
\fI<store_dir>\fR/\fI<app_name>\fR/\fI<store_type>\fR
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
\fI<store_dir>\fR/\fI<store_type>\fR
.RE
.sp
.LP
Where \fI<store_dir>\fR is the directory specified by \fB-k\fR, \fI<app_name>\fR is the name of the application doing the searching, and \fI<store_type>\fR is one of \fBkeystore\fR (for private keys), \fBcertstore\fR (for untrusted public key certificates), or \fBtruststore\fR (for trusted certificate authority certificates).
.sp
.LP
For example, when \fBpkgadd\fR is run with \fB-k\fR \fB/export/certs\fR, then the following locations are successively searched to find the trust store:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
/export/certs/pkgadd/truststore
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
/export/certs/truststore
.RE
.sp
.LP
This searching order enables administrators to have a single location for most applications, and special certificate locations for certain applications.
.SH KEYSTORE AND CERTIFICATE FORMATS
.sp
.LP
The packaging utilities, such as \fBpkgtrans\fR, require access to a set of keys and certificates in order to sign, and optionally verify, packages.
.sp
.LP
The keystore files found by following the search pattern specified in \fBKEYSTORE LOCATIONS\fR must each be a self-contained PKCS#12-format file.
.sp
.LP
When signing a package with \fBpkgtrans\fR, if a \fBcertstore\fR has more than one public key certificate, then each public key must have a \fBfriendlyName\fR attribute in order to be identifiable and selectable with the \fB-a\fR option when signing packages. In addition, the public key certificate selected with \fB-a\fR and found in the \fBcertstore\fR must have an associated private key in the keystore.
.sp
.LP
Several browsers and utilities can be used to export and import certificates and keys into a PKCS#12 keystore. For example, a trusted certificate can be exported from Mozilla, and then imported into a PKCS#12 keystore for use with \fBpkgadd\fR with the OpenSSL Toolkit.
.SH PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgtrans\fR and \fBpkgadd\fR accept password arguments, typically using \fB-p\fR to specify the password. These allow the password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of these options take a single argument whose format is described below. If no password argument is given and a password is required then the user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current terminal with echoing turned off.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBpass:\fIpassword\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The actual password is \fIpassword\fR. Because the password is visible to utilities such as \fBps\fR this form should only be used where security is not important.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBenv:\fIvar\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Obtain the password from the environment variable \fIvar\fR. Because the environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms this option should be used with caution.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBfile:\fIpathname\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The first line contained within \fIpathname\fR is the password. \fIpathname\fR need not refer to a regular file: it could, for example, refer to a device or named pipe. For example, to read the password from standard input, use \fBfile:/dev/stdin\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When transferring a package to a spool directory, the \fB-r\fR, \fB-n\fR, and \fB-a\fR options cannot be used.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-r\fR option can be used to indicate a directory name as well as a filename. The directory can contain numerous response files, each sharing the name of the package with which it should be associated. This would be used, for example, when adding multiple interactive packages with one invocation of \fBpkgadd\fR. In this situation, each package would need a response file. If you create response files with the same name as the package (for example, \fBpkinst1\fR and \fBpkinst2\fR), then name the directory in which these files reside after the \fB-r\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-n\fR option causes the installation to halt if any interaction is needed to complete it.
.sp
.LP
If the default \fIadmin\fR file is too restrictive, the administration file may need to be modified to allow for total non-interaction during a package installation. See \fBadmin\fR(4) for details.
.sp
.LP
If a package stream is specified with \fB-d\fR, and a digital signature is found in that stream, the default behavior is to attempt to validate the certificate and signature found. This behavior can be overridden with \fBadmin\fR file settings. See \fBadmin\fR(4) for more information.
