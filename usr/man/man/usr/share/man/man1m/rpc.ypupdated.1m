.SH NAME
rpc.ypupdated, ypupdated \- server for changing NIS information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/netsvc/yp/rpc.ypupdated\fR [\fB-is\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBypupdated\fR is a daemon that updates information in the Network Information Service (NIS). \fBypupdated\fR consults the  \fBupdaters\fR(4) file in the  \fB/var/yp\fR directory to determine which \fBNIS\fR maps should be updated and how to change them.
.sp
.LP
By default, the daemon requires the most secure method of authentication available to it, either \fBDES\fR (secure) or \fBUNIX\fR (insecure).
.sp
.LP
On start up, \fBypupdated\fR checks for the existence of a NIS to LDAP (N2L) configuration file, \fB/var/yp/NISLDAPmapping\fR. If the file is present, \fBypupdated\fR generates an informational message and exits. \fBypupdated\fR is not supported in N2L mode.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Accept \fBRPC\fR calls with the insecure  \fBAUTH_UNIX\fR credentials. This allows programmatic updating of the \fBNIS\fR maps in all networks.

\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Accept only calls authenticated using the secure  \fBRPC\fR mechanism (\fBAUTH_DES\fR authentication). This disables programmatic updating of the \fBNIS\fR maps unless the network supports these calls.
