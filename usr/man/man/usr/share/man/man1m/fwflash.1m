.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwflash\fR command writes a binary image file to supported flashable devices attached to a Solaris host. It also provides the ability to read firmware to a file if supported by the device. Because changing the firmware in a device can have significant impact on the stability of a system, only users with the privilege \fBAll\fR are allowed to execute this command. Users authorized to run \fBfwflash\fR can be granted the "Firmware Flash Update" Rights Profile.
.sp
.LP
The first form of the command, above, provides information about devices. It lists all devices currently available on the system that are supported by \fBfwflash\fR for firmware upgrade. You can filter the list operation, to display only specified classes of devices. The second form of the command provides the operations to read or write the firmware images to specific devices.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIdevice_class\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An optional parameter, valid only when used with the \fB-l\fR option. This option causes the command to list only devices of a specific class type. Currently supported classes are \fBIB\fR, \fBses\fR, \fBsesgen\fR, or \fBALL\fR. If \fB-c\fR is not specified for the \fB-l\fRoption, the class defaults to \fBALL\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdev_path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fIdev_path\fR is absolute path name of the device that the user wants to modify with the \fB-f\fRor \fB-r\fR operation. If the device cannot be found, the command fails. If the \fB-d\fR option is specified, then either \fB-f\fR or \fB-r\fR must also be specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfile1\fR,\fIfile2\fR,\fIfile3\fR,...\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the path to one or more binary firmware image files you want to write to the device. \fBfwflash\fR will verify that each file is a valid firmware image for the specified device. If it is not, the command fails with an appropriate error message.
.sp
If multiple firmware image files are specified, each image is verified and flashed to the device in the order given on the command line. If any of the specified files cannot be successfully flashed, then an appropriate message is displayed.
.sp
After a new firmware image is flashed to a device, a reboot is required to correctly activate the new firmware.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display the command line usage message for \fBfwflash\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
List the devices on a system available for firmware upgrade and display information specific to each device or device class.
.sp
For InfiniBand (IB) devices, the list operation  displays the \fBguid\fRs (Globally Unique Identifier) currently set for the HCA, as well as the current firmware revision installed. There are four separate \fBguid\fRs on the HCA; two of them can be set with the same value.
.sp
For SCSI Enclosure Services (\fBses\fR or \fBsgen\fR) devices, an identifying target-port worldwide name is displayed, if available.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the path to a file to create when reading the firmware from the device. The \fB-f\fR and \fB-r\fR options are mutually exclusive.
.sp
Not all flashable devices support reading firmware images back from the device.  At present, only InfiniBand (IB) devices are supported for this operation. A message will be displayed if the selected device does not support this operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display \fBfwflash\fR version information and exit.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-y\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Valid only when a flash read (\fB-r\fR) or write (\fB-f\fR) operation is specified. This option causes \fBfwflash\fR not to prompt for confirmation during operation and operate non-interactively. Note that there is no option that allows you to forcibly flash an incompatible firmware image onto a device.

Usage:
      fwflash [-l [-c device_class | ALL]] | [-v] | [-h]
      fwflash [-f file1,file2,file3,... | -r file] [-y] -d device_path

      -l              list flashable devices in this system
      -c device_class limit search to a specific class
                      eg IB for InfiniBand, ses for SCSI Enclosures
      -v              print version number of fwflash utility
      -h              print this usage message

      -f file1,file2,file3,...
                      firmware image file list to flash
      -r file         file to dump device firmware to
      -y              answer Yes/Y/y to prompts
      -d device_path  pathname of device to be flashed

      If -d device_path is specified, then one of -f <files>
      or -r <file> must also be specified

      If multiple firmware images are required to be flashed
      they must be listed together, separated by commas. The
      images will be flashed in the order specified.
