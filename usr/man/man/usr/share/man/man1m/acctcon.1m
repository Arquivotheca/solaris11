.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBacctcon\fR converts a sequence of login/logoff records to total accounting records (see the \fBtacct\fR format in \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD)). The login/logoff records are read from standard input.  The file \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR is usually the source of the login/logoff records; however, because it might contain corrupted records or system date changes, it should first be fixed using \fBwtmpfix\fR. The fixed version of file \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR can then be redirected to \fBacctcon\fR. The \fBtacct\fR records are written to standard output.
.sp
.LP
\fBacctcon\fR is a combination of the programs \fBacctcon1\fR and \fBacctcon2\fR. \fBacctcon1\fR converts login/logoff records, taken from the fixed \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR file, to ASCII output. \fBacctcon2\fR reads the ASCII records produced by \fBacctcon1\fR and converts them to \fBtacct\fR records. \fBacctcon1\fR can be used with the \fB-l\fR and \fB-o\fR options, described below, as well as with the \fB-p\fR and \fB-t\fR options.

\fBacctcon1\fR maintains a list of lines on which users are logged in. When it reaches the end of its input, it emits a session record for each line that still appears to be active. It normally assumes that its input is a current file, so that it uses the current time as the ending time for each session still in progress. The \fB-t\fR flag causes it to use, instead, the last time found in its input, thus assuring reasonable and repeatable numbers for non-current files.

\fIlineuse\fR is created to contain a summary of line usage showing line name, number of minutes used, percentage of total elapsed time used, number of sessions charged, number of logins, and number of logoffs.  This file helps track line usage, identify bad lines, and find software and hardware oddities. Hangup, termination of \fBlogin\fR(1) and termination of the login shell each generate logoff records, so that the number of logoffs is often three to four times the number of sessions. See \fB init\fR(1M) and \fButmpx\fR(4).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The line usage report is confused by date changes. Use \fBwtmpfix\fR (see \fBfwtmp\fR(1M)), with the \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR file as an argument, to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
During a single invocation of any given command, the \fBacctcon\fR, \fBacctcon1\fR, and \fBacctcon2\fR commands can process a maximum of:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
6000 distinct session

.el o
1000 distinct terminal lines

If at some point the actual  number of any one of these items exceeds the maximum, the command will not succeed.
