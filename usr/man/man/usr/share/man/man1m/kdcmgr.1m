.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBkdcmgr\fR utility to do the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Configure a master Key Distribution Center (KDC) server.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Configure a slave KDC. This assumes that a master KDC has already been configured. The default propagation method configured is incremental propagation. See \fBkpropd\fR(1M).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Specify a list of slave KDCs to configure service principals and create access control list for those slaves on the master KDC.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If you specify no options, \fBkdcmgr\fR prompts you for required information, including a password to generate the master key and a password for the administrative principal. When you specify sufficient options, you are still prompted for these passwords, unless you specified the \fB-p\fR \fIpwfile\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The \fBkdcmgr\fR utility must be run as superuser or by someone who has the Primary Administrator role. The command must be run on the server from which it is invoked.
.sp
.LP
Note that \fBkdcmgr\fR requires the user to enter sensitive information, such as the password used to generate the database's master key and the password for the administrative principal. Great care must be taken to ensure that the connection to the server is secured over the network, by using a protocol such as \fBssh\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
You must also exercise great care when selecting the administrative and master key passwords. They should be derived from non-dictionary words and a long string of characters consisting of all of the following character classes:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
special characters (for example, !@#$%^&*)
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
numerals (0-9)
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
uppercase letters
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIadmprincipal\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When creating a master KDC, specifies the administrative principal, \fIadmprincipal\fR, that will be created.
.sp
When creating a slave KDC, \fIadmprincipal\fR is used to authenticate as the administrative principal.
.sp
If you omit \fB-a\fR, the suggested default administrative principal name is the output of \fBlogname\fR(1) appended by \fB/admin\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIenctype\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the encryption type to be used when creating the key for the master key, which is used to encrypt all principal keys in the database. The set of valid encryption types used here are described in \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) under the \fBpermitted_enctypes\fR option. Note that the encryption type specified here must be supported on all KDCs or else they will not be able to decrypt any of the principal keys. Solaris 9 and earlier releases support only the \fBdes-cbc-crc\fR encryption type for the master key. Therefore, if any of the master or slave KDCs are of these older releases, then \fB-e\fR \fBdes-cbc-crc\fR would need to be specified on all KDCs configured with \fBkdcmgr\fR.
.sp
The default encryption type is \fBaes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays usage information for \fBkdcmgr\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIpwfile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Provides the location of the password file that contains the password used to create the administrative principal and/or master key.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fR This option should be used with great care. Make sure that this \fIpwfile\fR is accessible only by a privileged user and on a local file system. Once the KDC has been configured, you should remove \fIpwfile\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIrealm\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the default realm for this server.
.sp
If the \fB-r\fR option is not specified, \fBkdcmgr\fR attempts to obtain the machine's local domain name by submitting the canonical form of the machine's host name to DNS and using the return value to derive the domain name. If successful, the domain name is converted to uppercase and proposed as the default realm name.
.RE

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

.LP
The following subcommands are supported:
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.sp
\fImasterkdc\fR specifies the master KDC to authenticate and with which to perform administrative tasks. If the \fB-m\fR option is not specified, you are prompted for a master KDC host name.
.RE

.na
\fB\fBstatus\fR\fR

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSetting up a Master KDC
.sp
.LP
The following command configures a master KDC with the administrative principal \fBuser1/admin\fR and with the realm name \fBEXAMPLE.COM\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBkdcmgr -a user1/admin -r EXAMPLE.COM create\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that a password will be required to assign to the newly created \fBuser1/admin\fR principal. The password for the master key will also need to be provided.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRSetting up a Slave KDC
.sp
.LP
The following command configures a slave KDC, authenticates with the administrative principal \fBuser1/admin\fR, specifies \fBkdc1\fR as the master, and uses the \fBEXAMPLE.COM\fR realm name:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBkdcmgr -a user1/admin -r EXAMPLE.COM create -m kdc1 slave\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that you must enter the correct password for \fBuser1/admin\fR and that the master KDC must already have been created before entering this command. The correct password for the master key is also required.
