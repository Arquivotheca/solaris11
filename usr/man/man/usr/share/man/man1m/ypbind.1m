.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
NIS provides a simple network lookup service consisting of databases and processes. The databases are stored at the machine that runs an NIS server process. The programmatic interface to NIS is described in \fBypclnt\fR(3NSL). Administrative tools are described in \fBypinit\fR(1M), \fBypwhich\fR(1), and \fBypset\fR(1M). Tools to see the contents of NIS maps are described in \fBypcat\fR(1), and \fBypmatch\fR(1).

\fBypbind\fR is a daemon process that is activated at system startup time from the \fBsvc:/network/nis/client:default\fR service. By default, it is invoked as \fBypbind\fR \fB-broadcast\fR. \fBypbind\fR runs on all client machines that are set up to use \fBNIS\fR. The function of \fBypbind\fR is to remember information that lets all \fBNIS\fR client processes on a node communicate with some \fBNIS\fR server process. \fBypbind\fR must run on every machine which has \fBNIS\fR client processes. The \fBNIS\fR server may or may not be running on the same node, but must be running somewhere on the network.

.LP
The SMF service \fBsvc:/network/nis/client\fR has the following properties in the \fBconfig\fR property group:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
config.use_broadcast
config.use_ypsetme
.fi
.in -2

.LP
The information \fBypbind\fR remembers is called a \fIbinding\fR \(em the association of a domain name with a \fBNIS\fR server. The process of binding is driven by client requests. As a request for an unbound domain comes in, if started with the \fB-broadcast\fR option, the \fBypbind\fR process broadcasts on the net trying to find an \fBNIS\fR server, that is, a \fBypserv\fR process serving the domain with a name the same as (case sensitive) the name of the domain in the client request. Since the binding is established by broadcasting, there must be at least one \fBNIS\fR server on the net. If started without the \fB-broadcast\fR option, \fBypbind\fR process steps through the list of \fBNIS\fR servers that was created by \fBypinit\fR \fB-c\fR for the requested domain. There must be an \fBNIS\fR server process on at least one of the hosts in the \fBNIS\fR servers file. It is recommended that you list each of these NIS servers by name and numeric IP address in \fB/etc/hosts\fR. Though the practice is not recommended, NIS allows you to list servers by numeric address only, bypassing \fB/etc/hosts\fR. In such a configuration, \fBypwhich\fR(1) returns a numeric address instead of a name.
.sp
.LP
Once a domain is bound by \fBypbind\fR, that same binding is given to every client process on the node. The \fBypbind\fR process on the local node or a remote node may be queried for the binding of a particular domain by using the \fBypwhich\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
If \fBypbind\fR is unable to speak to the \fBNIS\fR server process it is bound to, it marks the domain as unbound, tells the client process that the domain is unbound, and tries to bind the domain once again. Requests received for an unbound domain will wait until the requested domain is bound. In general, a bound domain is marked as unbound when the node running the \fBNIS\fR server crashes or gets overloaded. In such a case, \fBypbind\fR will try to bind to another \fBNIS\fR server using the process described above.\fBypbind\fR also accepts requests to set its binding for a particular domain. The request is usually generated by the \fBypset\fR(1M) command. In order for \fBypset\fR to work, \fBypbind\fR must have been invoked with flags \fB-ypset\fR or \fB-ypsetme\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-broadcast\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Send a broadcast datagram using \fBUDP/IP\fR that requests the information needed to bind to a specific \fBNIS\fR server. This option is analogous to \fBypbind\fR with no options in earlier Sun releases and is recommended for ease of use.
.sp
Enabling the SMF property \fBconfig.use_broadcast\fR enables \fB-broadcast\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-ypset\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow users from any remote machine to change the binding by means of the \fBypset\fR command. By default, no one can change the binding. This option is insecure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-ypsetme\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Only allow \fBroot\fR on the local machine to change the binding to a desired server by means of the \fBypset\fR command. \fBypbind\fR can verify the caller is indeed a \fBroot\fR user by accepting such requests only on the loopback transport. By default, no external process can change the binding.
.sp
Enabling the SMF property \fBconfig.use_ypsetme\fR enables \fB-ypsetme\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBypbind\fR supports multiple domains. The \fBypbind\fR process can maintain bindings to several domains and their servers, the default domain is the one specified by the \fBdomainname\fR(1M) command at startup time.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-broadcast\fR option works only on the \fBUDP\fR transport. It is insecure since it trusts "any" machine on the net that responds to the broadcast request and poses itself as an \fBNIS\fR server.
.sp
.LP
The \fBypbind\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/nis/client:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
