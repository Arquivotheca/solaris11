.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBgetty\fR sets terminal type, modes, speed, and line discipline. \fBgetty\fR is a symbolic link to  \fB/usr/lib/saf/ttymon\fR. It is included for compatibility with previous releases  for the few applications that still call \fBgetty\fR directly.
.sp
.LP
\fBgetty\fR can only be executed by the super-user, (a process with the user  \fBID\fR \fBroot\fR). Initially \fBgetty\fR prints the login prompt, waits for the user's login name, and then invokes the \fBlogin\fR command. \fBgetty\fR attempts to adapt the system to the terminal speed by using the options and arguments specified on the command line.
.sp
.LP
Without optional arguments, \fBgetty\fR specifies the following: The  \fIspeed\fR of the interface is set to 300 baud, either parity is allowed, \fBNEWLINE\fR characters are converted to carriage return-line feed, and tab expansion is performed on the standard output. \fBgetty\fR types the login prompt before reading the user's name a character at a time. If a null character (or framing error)  is received, it is assumed to be the result of the user pressing the  \fBBREAK\fR key. This will cause \fBgetty\fR to attempt the next \fIspeed\fR in the series. The series that \fBgetty\fR tries is determined by what it finds in \fB/etc/ttydefs \fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
If the \fB-h\fR flag is not set, a hangup will be forced by setting the speed to zero before setting the speed to the default or a specified speed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fI timeout\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Specifies that \fBgetty\fR should exit if the open on the line succeeds and no one types anything in  \fItimeout\fR seconds.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fI file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The \fB-c\fR option is no longer supported. Instead use  \fB/usr/sbin/sttydefs\fR \fB-l\fR to list the contents of the  \fB/etc/ttydefs\fR file and perform a validity check on the file.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIline\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The name of a  \fBTTY\fR line in  \fB/dev\fR to which \fBgetty\fR is to attach itself. \fBgetty\fR uses this string as the name of a file in the \fB/dev\fR directory to open for reading and writing.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIspeed\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The  \fIspeed\fR argument is a label to a speed and  \fBTTY\fR definition in the file \fB/etc/ttydefs\fR. This definition tells \fBgetty\fR at what speed to run initially,  what the initial \fBTTY\fR settings are, and what speed to try next, (should the user press the  \fBBREAK\fR key to indicate that the speed is inappropriate). The default \fIspeed\fR is 300 baud.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItype\fR and \fIlinedisc\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
These options are obsolete and will be ignored.
