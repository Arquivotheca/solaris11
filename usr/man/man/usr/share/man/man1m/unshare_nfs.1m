\fBunshare\fR [\fB-F\fR nfs] \fIpathname\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBunshare\fR command makes local file systems unavailable for mounting by remote systems. The shared file system must correspond to a line with NFS as the \fIFSType\fR in the file \fB/etc/dfs/sharetab\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If the file system being unshared is a symbolic link to a valid pathname, the canonical path (the path which the symbolic link follows) will be unshared.
.sp
.LP
For example, if \fB/export/foo\fR is a symbolic link to \fB/export/bar\fR (\fB/export/foo -> /export/bar\fR), the following \fBunshare\fR command will result in \fB/export/bar\fR as the unshared pathname (and not \fB/export/foo\fR):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example#  unshare -F nfs /export/foo
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For file systems that are accessed by NFS Version 4 clients, once the unshare is complete, all NFS Version 4 state (open files and file locks) are released and unrecoverable by the clients. If the intent is to share the file system after some administrative action, the NFS daemon (\fBnfsd\fR) should first be stopped and then the file system unshared. After the administrative action is complete, the file system would then be shared and the NFS daemon restarted. See \fBnfsd\fR(1M)
