.SH NAME
quot \- summarize file system ownership
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBquot\fR [\fB-acfhnv\fR] \fIfilesystem\fR...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBquot\fR \fB-a\fR [\fB-cfhnv\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBquot\fR displays the number of blocks (1024 bytes) in the named \fIfilesystem\fR (one or more) currently owned by each user. There is a limit of 2048 blocks. Files larger than this will be counted as a 2048 block file, but the total block count will be correct.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Generate a report for all mounted file systems.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display three columns giving a file size in blocks, the number of files of that size, and a cumulative total of blocks containing files of that size or a smaller size.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Display three columns giving, for each user, the number of blocks owned, the count of number of files, and the user name. This option is incompatible with the \fB-c\fR and \fB-v\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Estimate the number of blocks in the file. This does not account for files with holes in them.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Attach names to the list of files read from standard input. \fBquot\fR \fB-n\fR cannot be used alone, because it expects data from standard input. For example, the pipeline 
.sp
\fBncheck myfilesystem | sort +0n | quot \fR\fB-n\fR\fB myfilesystem\fR
.sp
will produce a list of all files and their owners. This option is incompatible with all other options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
In addition to the default output, display three columns containing the number of blocks not accessed in the last 30, 60, and 90 days.
