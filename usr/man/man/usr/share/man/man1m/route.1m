.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBroute\fR manually manipulates the network routing tables. These tables are normally maintained by the system routing daemon, such as \fBin.routed\fR(1M) and \fBin.ripngd\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
\fBroute\fR supports a limited number of general options, but a rich command language. Users can specify an arbitrary request that can be delivered by means of the programmatic interface discussed in \fBroute\fR(7P).
.sp
.LP
\fBroute\fR uses a routing socket and the new message types \fBRTM_ADD\fR, \fBRTM_DELETE\fR, \fBRTM_GET\fR, and \fBRTM_CHANGE\fR. While only superusers can modify routing tables, the \fBRTM_GET\fR operation is allowed for non-privileged users.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

.RS 15n
.rt  
Flush the routing tables of all gateway entries. If you use the \fB-f\fR option in conjunction with any of the \fBroute\fR sub-commands, \fBroute\fR flushes the gateways before performing the sub-command. Specify the table to flush by placing the \fBinet\fR or \fBinet6\fR modifier immediately after the \fB-f\fR option. If unspecified, flushing IPv4 (\fBinet\fR) routes is the default.

.RS 15n
.rt  
Make changes to the network route tables persistent across system restarts. The operation is applied to the network routing tables first and, if successful, is then applied to the list of saved routes used at system startup. In determining whether an operation was successful, a failure to add a route that already exists or to delete a route that is not in the routing table is ignored. Particular care should be taken when using host or network names in persistent routes, as network-based name resolution services are not available at the time routes are added at startup.

Specify an alternate root directory where \fBroute\fR applies changes. This option is ignored unless used in conjunction with the \fB-p\fR option. When \fB-R\fR is specified, route changes are applied only to the list of saved routes to be used at startup, \fBnot\fR to the network routing tables. In addition, certain checks, such as the existence of network interfaces used with \fB-ifp\fR, are skipped. This can be useful from within JumpStart scripts, where the root directory of the system being modified is in a location other than \fB/\fR.

.sp
.LP
\fBroute\fR executes its sub-commands on routes to destinations by way of gateways.
.SS "Destinations and Gateways"
.sp
.LP
By default, destination and gateway addresses are interpreted as IPv4 addresses. All symbolic names are tried first as a host name, using \fBgetipnodebyname\fR(3SOCKET). If this lookup fails in the AF_INET case, \fBgetnetbyname\fR(3SOCKET) interprets the name as that of a network. 
.sp
.LP
Including an optional modifier on the command line before the address changes how the \fBroute\fR sub-command interprets it.

.sp

.ad
.RS 10n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.LP
For IPv4 addresses, routes to a particular host are by default distinguished from those to a network by interpreting the Internet address specified as the destination. If the destination has a \fBlocal address part\fR (that is, the portion not covered by the netmask) of \fB0\fR, or if the destination is resolved as the symbolic name of a network, then the route is assumed to be to a network; otherwise, it is presumed to be a route to a host.
.sp

.sp
.LP
Two modifiers avoid confusion between addresses and keywords (for example., \fBhost\fR used as a symbolic host name). You can distinguish a \fIdestination\fR by preceding it with the \fB-dst\fR modifier. You can distinguish a gateway address by using the \fB-gateway\fR modifier. If the destination is directly reachable by way of an interface requiring no intermediary IP router to act as a gateway, this can be indicated by using the \fB-interface\fR or \fB-iface\fR modifier. 
.sp
.LP
In the following example, the route does not refer to an external gateway (router), but rather to one of the machine's interfaces. Packets with IP destination addresses matching the destination and mask on such a route are sent out on the interface identified by the gateway address. For interfaces using the ARP protocol, this type of route is used to specify that all matching destinations are local to the physical link. That is, a host could be configured to ARP for all addresses, without regard to the configured interface netmask, by adding a default route using this command. For example: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# route add default \fIhostname\fR -interface
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where gateway address \fIhostname\fR is the name or IP address associated with the network interface over which all matching packets should be sent. On a host with a single network interface, \fIhostname\fR is usually the same as the \fInodename\fR returned by the \fBuname -n\fR command. See \fBuname\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
For backward compatibility with older systems, directly reachable routes can also be specified by placing a \fB0\fR after the gateway address:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# route add default \fIhostname\fR 0 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This value was once a route metric, but this metric is no longer used. If the value is specified as \fB0\fR, then the destination is directly reachable (equivalent to specifying \fB-\fR\fBinterface\fR). If it is non-zero but cannot be interpreted as a subnet mask, then a gateway is used (default). 
.sp
.LP
With the \fBAF_INET\fR address family or an IPv4 address, a separate subnet mask can be specified. This can be specified in one of the following ways:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
IP address following the gateway address . This is typically specified in \fIdecimal dot\fR notation as for \fBinet_addr\fR(3SOCKET) rather than in symbolic form.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
IP address following the \fB-netmask\fR qualifier.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Slash character and a decimal length appended to the destination address.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If a subnet mask is not specified, the mask used is the subnet mask of the output interface selected by the gateway address, if the classful network of the destination is the same as the classful network of the interface. Otherwise, the classful network mask for the destination address is used. 
.sp
.LP
Each of the following examples creates an IPv4 route to the destination \fB192.0.2.32\fR subnet with a subnet mask of \fB255.255.255.224\fR: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# route add 192.0.2.32/27 somegateway
example# route add 192.0.2.32 -netmask 255.255.255.224 somegateway
example# route add 192.0.2.32 somegateway 255.255.255.224
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For IPv6, only the slash format is accepted. The following example creates an IPv6 route to the destination \fB33fe::\fR with a netmask of \fB16\fR one-bits followed by 112 zero-bits.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# route add -inet6 3ffe::/16 somegateway
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In cases where the gateway does not uniquely identify the output interface (for example, when several interfaces have the same address), you can use the \fB-ifp\fR \fIifname\fR modifier to specify the interface by name. For example, \fB\fR\fB-ifp\fR \fBlo0\fR associates the route with the \fBlo0\fR interface. If the named interface is an underlying interface in an IPMP (IP multipathing) group, then requests to add a route will automatically be translated to the corresponding IPMP IP interface, and requests to delete or change a route on an underlying interface will fail.
.sp
.LP
When the routing table contains several equal routes, that is, routes for the same destination and mask, then IP attempts to spread the traffic over those routes. The spreading is such that an individual transport connection uses the same route to avoid packet reordering as seen by, for example, TCP. The details of the spreading algorithm is not documented and is likely to evolve over time.
.SS "Routing Flags"
.sp
.LP
Routes have associated flags that influence operation of the protocols when sending to destinations matched by the routes. These flags can be set (and in some cases cleared, indicated by \fB~\fR) by including the following modifiers on the command line:

.TE

.sp
.LP
The optional \fB-indirect\fR modifier allows adding routes where the gateway is not directly reachable. When an indirect route is the best match for a packet to be sent or forwarded, then IP proceeds to look up that gateway to find a route that is directly reachable. The \fB-indirect\fR modifier can be used even if the gateway is directly reachable.
.sp
.LP
The optional modifiers \fB-rtt\fR, \fB-rttvar\fR, \fB-sendpipe\fR, \fB-recvpipe\fR, \fB-mtu\fR, \fB-hopcount\fR, \fB-expire\fR, and \fB-ssthresh\fR provide initial values to quantities maintained in the routing entry by transport level protocols, such as \fBTCP\fR. These can be individually locked either by preceding each modifier to be locked by the \fB-lock\fR meta-modifier, or by specifying that all ensuing metrics can be locked by the \fB-lockrest\fR meta-modifier.

Security attributes of the route. This modifier is available only if the system is configured with the Solaris Trusted Extensions feature.
.sp
The \fB-secattr\fR modifier has the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
min_sl=\fIval\fR,max_sl=\fIval\fR,doi=\fIval\fR,cipso
.fi
.in -2

or:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sl=VAL,doi=VAL,cipso
.fi
.in -2

In the first form, above, the \fIval\fR for \fBmin_sl\fR and \fBmax_sl\fR is a sensitivity label in either hex or string form. The \fIval\fR for \fBdoi\fR is a non-negative integer. The route will apply only for packets with the same domain of interpretation as defined by the \fBdoi\fR value and within the accreditation range defined by the \fBmin_sl\fR and \fBmax_sl\fR values. The \fBcipso\fR keyword is optional and set by default. Valid \fBmin_sl\fR, \fBmax_sl\fR and \fBdoi\fR keyword/value pairs are mandatory. Note that if \fIval\fR contains a space, it must be protected by double quotes.
.sp
The second form, above, is equivalent to specifying the first form with the same \fBVAL\fR for \fBmin_sl\fR and \fBmax_sl\fR. The second form should be used for the \fBget\fR command, because \fBget\fR uses only a single sensitivity label.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Specifying that destinations are local (with the \fB-interface\fRmodifier) assumes that the routers implement \fBproxy ARP\fR, meaning that they respond to ARP queries for all reachable destinations. Normally, using either router discovery or RIP is more reliable and scalable than using proxy ARP. See \fBin.routed\fR(1M) for information related to RIP.
.sp
.LP
Combining the all destinations are local route with subnet or network routes can lead to unpredictable results. The search order as it relates to the all destinations are local route are undefined and can vary from release to release.
