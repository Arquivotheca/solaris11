.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscadm\fR utility administers the System Controller (\fBSC\fR). This utility allows the host server to interact with the \fBSC\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBscadm\fR utility \fBmust\fR be run as root.
.sp
.LP
The interface, output, and location in the directory hierarchy for \fBscadm\fR are uncommitted and might change.
.sp
.LP
\fIplatform-name\fR is the name of the platform implementation. Use the \fBuname\fR \fB-i\fR command to identify the platform implementation. See \fBuname\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
The \fBscadm\fR utility has a number of subcommands. Some subcommands have specific options and arguments associated with them. See \fBSUBCOMMANDS\fR, \fBOPTIONS\fR, \fBOPERANDS\fR, and \fBUSAGE\fR.
.SS "SUBCOMMANDS"
.sp
.LP
Subcommands immediately follow the \fBscadm\fR command on the command line, and are separated from the command by a SPACE. 
.sp
.LP
The following subcommands are supported
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconsolehistory\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display the \fBSC\fR's console log. The \fBSC\fR maintains a running log which captures all console output. This log is maintained as a first-in, first-out buffer: New console output may displace old console output if the buffer is full. By default, only the last eight kilobytes of the console log file are displayed.
.sp
The optional \fB-a\fR argument specifies that the entire console log file be displayed.
.sp
It is possible for the \fBSC\fR to fill this log more quickly than the \fBconsolehistory\fR subcommand can read it. This means that it is possible for some log data to be lost before it can be displayed. If this happens, the \fBconsolehistory\fR subcommand displays "scadm: lost <number> bytes of console log data" in the log output, to indicate that some data was lost.
.sp
The format for the \fBconsolehistory\fR subcommand is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
scadm consolehistory [-a]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The \fBconsolehistory\fR subcommand is not available on all platforms. If this command is used on a platform that does not support it, \fBscadm\fR prints this message:
.sp
.in +2

.RS 4n
Display the contents of the "field replacable unit" log maintained by the \fBSC\fR. By default, only the last eight kilobytes of the fru history log file are displayed. The data in contained this log contains snapshots of the \fBSC\fR's "showfru" command, taken whenever the system is reset, or a hot-plug event is detected by the \fBSC\fR.
.sp
The optional \fB-a\fR argument specifies that the entire fru log file be displayed.
.sp
It is possible for the \fBSC\fR to fill this log more quickly than the \fBfruhistory\fR subcommand can read it. This means that it is possible for some log data to be lost before it can be displayed. If this happens, the \fBfruhistory\fR subcommand displays "scadm: lost <number> bytes of fru log data" in the log output, to indicate that some data was lost.

.sp
It is possible for the \fBSC\fR to fill this log more quickly than the \fBloghistory\fR subcommand can read it. This means that it is possible for some log data to be lost before it can be displayed.
