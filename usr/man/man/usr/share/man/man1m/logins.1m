Account password status is unknown. That is, it is not a recognizable hashed password or any of the above entries. See \fBcrypt\fR(3C) for valid password hashes.
.RE

If the login is passworded, status is followed by the date the password was last changed, the number of days required between changes, and the number of days allowed before a change is required. The password aging information shows the time interval that the user receives a password expiration warning message (when logging on) before the password expires.
