.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBypxfr\fR command moves an \fBNIS\fR map in the default domain for the local host to the local host by making use of normal \fBNIS\fR services. It creates a temporary map in the directory \fB/var/yp/\fR\fIypdomain\fR (this directory must already exist; \fIypdomain\fR is the default domain for the local host), fills it by enumerating the map's entries, fetches the map parameters (master and order number), and loads them. It then deletes any old versions of the map and moves the temporary map to the real \fIname\fR.
.sp
.LP
If run interactively, \fBypxfr\fR writes its output to the terminal. However, if it is started without a controlling terminal, and if the log file \fB/var/yp/ypxfr.log\fR exists, it appends all its output to that file. Since \fBypxfr\fR is most often run from the privileged user's \fBcrontab\fR file, or by \fBypserv\fR, the log file can retain a record of what was attempted, and what the results were.
.sp
.LP
For consistency between servers, \fBypxfr\fR should be run periodically for every map in the \fBNIS\fR data base. Different maps change at different rates: a map might not change for months at a time, for instance, and can therefore be checked only once a day. Some maps might change several times per day. In such a case, you might want to check hourly for updates. A \fBcrontab\fR(1) entry can be used to automatically perform periodic updates. Rather than having a separate \fBcrontab\fR entry for each map, you can group commands to update several maps in a shell script. Examples (mnemonically named) are in \fB/usr/sbin/yp\fR: \fBypxfr_1perday\fR, \fBypxfr_2perday\fR, and \fBypxfr_1perhour\fR.

\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Do not send a "Clear current map" request to the local \fBypserv\fR process. Use this flag if \fBypserv\fR is not running locally at the time you are running \fBypxfr\fR. Otherwise, \fBypxfr\fR complains that it cannot communicate with the local \fBypserv\fR, and the transfer fails.

Force the transfer to occur even if the version at the master is not more recent than the local version.

.RS 22n
.rt  
This option is for use \fIonly\fR by \fBypserv\fR. When \fBypserv\fR starts \fBypxfr\fR, it specifies that \fBypxfr\fR should call back a \fByppush\fR process at the host \fIserver\fR, registered as program number \fIprog\fR, and waiting for a response to transaction \fItid\fR.

.RS 22n
.rt  
Get the map from \fIhost\fR, regardless of the master. If \fIhost\fR is not specified, \fBypxfr\fR asks the \fBNIS\fR service for the name of the master, and tries to get the map from there. \fIhost\fR must be a valid host name.
