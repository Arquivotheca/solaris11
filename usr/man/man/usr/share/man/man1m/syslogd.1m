\fB/usr/sbin/syslogd\fR [\fB-d\fR] [\fB-f\fR \fIconfigfile\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fImarkinterval\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsyslogd\fR reads and forwards system messages to the appropriate log files or users, depending upon the priority of a message and the system facility from which it originates. The configuration file \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR (see \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4)) controls where messages are forwarded. \fBsyslogd\fR logs a mark (timestamp) message every \fImarkinterval\fR minutes (default \fB20\fR) at priority \fBLOG_INFO\fR to the facility whose name is given as \fBmark\fR in the \fBsyslog.conf\fR file.
.sp
.LP
A system message consists of a single line of text, which may be prefixed with a priority code number enclosed in angle-brackets (\fB<\|>\fR); priorities are defined in \fB<sys/syslog.h>\fR\&.
.sp
.LP
\fBsyslogd\fR reads from the \fBSTREAMS\fR log driver, \fB/dev/log\fR, and from any transport provider specified in \fB/etc/netconfig\fR, \fB/etc/net/transport/hosts\fR, and \fB/etc/net/transport/services\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBsyslogd\fR reads the configuration file when it starts up, and again whenever it receives a \fBHUP\fR signal (see \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD), at which time it also closes all files it has open, re-reads its configuration file, and then opens only the log files that are listed in that file. \fBsyslogd\fR exits when it receives a \fBTERM\fR signal.
.sp
.LP
As it starts up, \fBsyslogd\fR creates the file \fB/var/run/syslog.pid\fR, if possible, containing its process identifier (\fBPID\fR).
.sp
.LP
If message \fBID\fR generation is enabled (see \fBlog\fR(7D)), each message will be preceded by an identifier in the following format: \fB[ID\fR \fImsgid facility\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIpriority\fR\fB]\fR. \fImsgid\fR is the message's numeric identifier described in \fBmsgid\fR(1M). \fIfacility\fR and \fIpriority\fR are described in \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4). \fB[ID 123456 kern.notice]\fR is an example of an identifier when message \fBID\fR generation is enabled. 
.sp
.LP
If the message originated in a loadable kernel module or driver, the kernel module's name (for example, \fBufs\fR) will be displayed instead of \fBunix\fR. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR for sample output from \fBsyslogd\fR with and without message \fBID\fR generation enabled.
.sp
.LP
In an effort to reduce visual clutter, message \fBID\fRs are not displayed when writing to the console; message \fBID\fRs are only written to the log file. See .
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/default/syslogd\fR file contains the following default parameter settings, which are in effect if neither the \fB-t\fR nor \fB-T\fR option is selected. See \fBFILES\fR.
.sp
.LP
The recommended way to allow or disallow message logging is through the use of the service management facility (\fBsmf\fR(5)) property:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/system-log/config/log_from_remote
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This property specifies whether remote messages are logged. \fBlog_from_remote=true\fR is equivalent to the \fB-t\fR command-line option and \fBfalse\fR is equivalent to the \fB-T\fR command-line option. The default value for \fB-log_from_remote\fR is \fBfalse\fR. See NOTES, below.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies whether remote messages are logged. \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE=NO\fR is equivalent to the \fB-t\fR command-line option. The default value for \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR is \fBYES\fR.

The following options are supported:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBmark\fR message is a system time stamp, and so it is only defined for the system on which \fBsyslogd\fR is running. It can not be forwarded to other systems. 
.sp
.LP
When \fBsyslogd\fR receives a \fBHUP\fR signal, it attempts to complete outputting pending messages, and close all log files to which it is currently logging messages. If, for some reason, one (or more) of these files does not close within a generous grace period, \fBsyslogd\fR discards the pending messages, forcibly closes these files, and starts reconfiguration. If this shutdown procedure is disturbed by an unexpected error and \fBsyslogd\fR cannot complete reconfiguration, \fBsyslogd\fR sends a mail message to the superuser on the current system stating that it has shut down, and exits.
.sp
.LP
Care should be taken to ensure that each window displaying messages forwarded by \fBsyslogd\fR (especially console windows) is run in the system default locale (which is \fBsyslogd\fR's locale). If this advice is not followed, it is possible for a \fBsyslog\fR message to alter the terminal settings for that window, possibly even allowing remote execution of arbitrary commands from that window.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsyslogd\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
 svc:/system/system-log:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
When \fBsyslogd\fR is started by means of \fBsvcadm\fR(1M), if a value is specified for \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR in the \fB/etc/defaults/syslogd\fR file, the SMF property \fBsvc:/system/system-log/config/log_from_remote\fR is set to correspond to the \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR value and the \fB/etc/default/syslogd\fR file is modified to replace the \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR specification with the following comment:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# LOG_FROM_REMOTE is now set using svccfg(1m), see syslogd(1m).
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If neither \fBLOG_FROM_REMOTE\fR nor \fBsvc:/system/system-log/config/log_from_remote\fR are defined, the default is to log remote messages.
.sp
.LP
On installation, the initial value of \fBsvc:/system/system-log/config/log_from_remote\fR is \fBfalse\fR.
