.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBintrstat\fR utility gathers and displays run-time interrupt statistics. The output is a table of device names and CPU IDs, where each row of the table denotes a device, and each column of the table denotes a CPU. Each cell in the table contains both the raw number of interrupts for the given device on the given CPU, and the percentage of absolute time spent in that device's interrupt handler on that CPU.
.sp
.LP
The device name is given in the form of \fB{\fR\fIname\fR}\fI#\fR\fB{\fR\fIinstance\fR\fB}\fR. The name is the normalized driver name, and typically corresponds to the name of the module implementing the driver. See \fBddi_driver_name\fR(9F). Many Sun-delivered drivers have their own manual pages. See \fBIntro\fR(7).
.sp
.LP
If standard output is a terminal, the table contains as many columns of data as can fit within the terminal width. If standard output is not a terminal, the table contains at most four columns of data. By default, data is gathered and displayed for all CPUs. If the data cannot fit in a single table, it is printed across multiple tables. The set of CPUs for which data is displayed can be optionally specified with the \fB-c\fR or \fB-C\fR option.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBintrstat\fR displays data once per second and runs indefinitely. Both of these behaviors can be optionally controlled with the interval and count parameters, respectively. See \fBOPERANDS\fR.
.sp
.LP
Because \fBintrstat\fR uses dynamic discovery, it reports only on devices that raise interrupts while the command is running. Any devices that are silent while \fBintrstat\fR is running are not displayed.
.sp
.LP
\fBintrstat\fR induces a small system-wide performance degradation. As a result, only the super-user can run \fBintrstat\fR by default. The \fISolaris Dynamic Tracing Guide\fR explains how administrators can grant privileges to other users to permit them to run \fBintrstat\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcpulist\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays data for the CPUs specified by \fIcpulist\fR.
.sp
\fIcpulist\fR can be a single processor ID (for example, \fB4\fR), a range of processor IDs (for example, \fB4-6\fR), or a comma separated list of processor IDs or processor ID ranges (for example, \fB4,5,6\fR or \fB4,6-8\fR). 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fIprocessor_set_id\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays data for the CPUs in the processor set specified by \fIprocessor_set_id\fR. 
.sp
\fBintrstat\fR modifies its output to always reflect the CPUs in the specified processor set. If a CPU is added to the set, \fBintrstat\fR modifies its output to include the added CPU. If a CPU is removed from the set, \fBintrstat\fR modifies its output to exclude the removed CPU. At most one processor set can be specified.

\fB\fB-T\fR \fBu\fR | \fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

Display a time stamp.
.sp
Specify \fBu\fR for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See \fBtime\fR(2). Specify \fBd\fR for standard date format. See \fBdate\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RS 4n
Enable or modify a DTrace runtime option or D compiler option. The list of options is found in the \fISolaris Dynamic Tracing Guide\fR. A boolean option is enabled by specifying its name. Options with values are set by separating the option name and value with an equal sign (\fB=\fR)

\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBintrstat\fR Without Options
.sp
.LP
Without options, \fBintrstat\fR displays a table of trap types and CPUs. At most, four columns can fit in the default terminal width. If there are more than four CPUs, multiple tables are displayed.

The following example runs \fBintrstat\fR on a uniprocessor Intel IA/32-based laptop:
