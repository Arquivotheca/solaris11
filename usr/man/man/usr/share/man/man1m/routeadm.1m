.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrouteadm\fR command is used to administer system-wide configuration for IP forwarding and routing. IP forwarding is the passing of IP packets from one network to another; IP routing is the use of a routing protocol to determine routes.
.sp
.LP
IP routing functions are also represented as services within the service management facility (SMF), and can be administered by means of \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) also, using the following fault management resource identifiers (FMRIs):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/routing/route:default
svc:/network/routing/ripng:default
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
See EXAMPLES for relevant examples.
.sp
.LP
In addition to enabling and disabling routing and forwarding, \fBrouteadm\fR is used to interact with SMF-based routing daemon services. Routing daemon services are identified by the presence of a \fBrouteadm\fR application property group, which \fBrouteadm\fR uses in administering the given service. Routing daemon services can also specify properties relating to their operation in the \fBrouting\fR application property group; these can be modified by means of \fBrouteadm\fR \fB-m\fR. If an FMRI for a service without such a property group is specified, an error is issued and the operation is not carried out. If a routing daemon has not been converted to SMF, the \fBipv4\fI[or 6]\fR-routing-daemon\fR, \fBipv4\fI[or 6]\fR-routing-daemon-args\fR, and \fBipv4\fI[or 6]\fR-routing-stop-cmd\fR variables can be used to specify the appropriate daemon for IPv4 or IPv6 routing. \fBrouteadm\fR will then run that daemon using the \fBsvc:/network/routing/legacy-routing:ipv4\fR\fI[or 6]\fR service as appropriate. This conversion process occurs when you issue an enable (\fB-e\fR), disable (\fB-d\fR) or an update (\fB-u\fR) command.

The following command-line options are supported:
.sp

\fB\fB-p\fR [\fIoption\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Print the configuration in parseable format. If \fIoption\fR is specified, only the configuration for the specified option or variable is displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot-dir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify an alternate root directory where \fBrouteadm\fR applies changes. This can be useful from within JumpStart scripts, where the root directory of the system being modified is mounted elsewhere.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

Apply the currently configured options to the running system. These options might include enabling or disabling IP forwarding and launching or killing routing daemons, if any are specified. It does not alter the state of the system for those settings that have been set to default. This option is meant to be used by administrators who do not want to reboot to apply their changes. In addition, this option upgrades non-SMF configurations from the invocations of daemon stop commands, which might include a set of arguments, to a simple enabling of the appropriate service.

.RE

.sp
.LP
The forwarding and routing settings are related but not mutually dependent. For example, a router typically forwards IP packets and uses a routing protocol, but nothing would prevent an administrator from configuring a router that forwards packets and does not use a routing protocol. In that case, the administrator would enable forwarding, disable routing, and populate the router's routing table with static routes.
.sp
.LP
The forwarding settings are global settings. Each interface also has an \fBIFF_ROUTER\fR forwarding flag that determines whether packets can be forwarded to or from a particular interface. That flag can be independently controlled by means of \fBifconfig\fR(1M)'s router option. When the global forwarding setting is changed (that is, \fB-u\fR is issued to change the value from \fBenabled\fR to \fBdisabled\fR or vice-versa), all interface flags in the system are changed simultaneously to reflect the new global policy. Interfaces configured by means of DHCP automatically have their interface-specific \fBIFF_ROUTER\fR flag cleared.
.sp
.LP
When a new interface is plumbed by means of \fBifconfig\fR, the value of the interface-specific forwarding flag is set according to the current global forwarding value. Thus, the forwarding value forms the "default" for all new interfaces.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fREnabling IPv4 Forwarding
.sp
.LP
IPv4 forwarding is disabled by default. The following command enables IPv4 forwarding:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBrouteadm -e ipv4-forwarding\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRApply Configured Settings to the Running System
.sp
.LP
In the previous example, a system setting was changed, but will not take effect until the next reboot unless a command such as the following is used:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBrouteadm -u\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRMaking a Setting Revert to its Default
.sp
.LP
To make the setting changed in the first example revert to its default, enter the following:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBrouteadm -r ipv4-forwarding\fR
example# \fBrouteadm -u\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRStarting \fBin.routed\fR with the \fB-q\fR Flag
.sp
.LP
Setting the \fB-q\fR flag is represented in the SMF service by setting the \fBquiet_mode\fR property to true. The following sequence of commands starts \fBin.routed\fR with the \fB-q\fR flag:

.sp
.in +2

example# \fBrouteadm -m route:default quiet_mode=true\fR
