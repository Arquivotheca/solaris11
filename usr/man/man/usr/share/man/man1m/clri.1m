.SH NAME
clri, dcopy \- clear inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBclri\fR [\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR] [\fB-V\fR] \fIspecial\fR \fIi-number\fR
.fi

\fBdcopy\fR [\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR] [\fB-V\fR] \fIspecial\fR \fIi-number\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBclri\fR writes zeros on the inodes with the decimal \fIi-number\fR on the file system stored on  \fIspecial\fR. After  \fBclri\fR, any blocks in the affected file show up as missing in an  \fBfsck\fR(1M) of \fIspecial\fR.
.sp
.LP
Read and write permission is required on the specified file system device. The inode becomes allocatable.
.sp
.LP
The primary purpose of this routine is to remove a file that for some reason appears in no directory. If it is used to zap an inode that does appear in a directory, care should be taken to track down the entry and remove it. Otherwise, when the inode is reallocated to some new file, the old entry will still point to that file. At that point, removing the old entry will destroy the new file. The new entry will again point to an unallocated inode, so the whole cycle is likely to be repeated again and again.
.sp
.LP
\fBdcopy\fR is a symbolic link to \fBclri\fR.
.SH OPTIONS

.RS 13n
.rt  
Specify the  \fIFSType\fR on which to operate. The  \fIFSType\fR should either be specified here or be determinable from  \fB/etc/vfstab\fR by matching  \fIspecial\fR with an entry in the table, or by consulting \fB/etc/default/fs\fR.

Echo the complete command line, but do not execute the command. The command line is generated by using the options and arguments provided by the user and adding to them information derived from \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. This option should be used to verify and validate the command line.
