.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpppstats\fR utility reports PPP-related statistics at regular intervals for the specified PPP interface. If the interface is unspecified, \fBpppstats\fR defaults to \fBsppp0\fR. The display is split horizontally into input and output sections containing columns of statistics describing the properties and volume of packets received and transmitted by the interface.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpppstats\fR options are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Display absolute values rather than deltas. With this option, all reports show statistics for the time elapsed since the link was initiated. Without this option, the second and subsequent reports show statistics for the time since the last report.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fB\fIcount\fR\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Repeat the display \fIcount\fR times. If this option is not specified, the default repeat count is 1 if the \fB-w\fR option is not specified, otherwise infinity.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fB\fIwait\fR\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt
