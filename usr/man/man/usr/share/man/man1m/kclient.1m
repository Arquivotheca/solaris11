.sp
.LP
The \fBkclient\fR utility needs to be run on the client machine with root permission and can be run either interactively or non-interactively. In the non-interactive mode, the user feeds in the required inputs by means of a profile, command-line options, or a combination of profile and command-line options. The user is prompted for "required" parameter values (\fBrealm\fR and \fBadminuser\fR), if found missing in the non-interactive run. The interactive mode is invoked when the utility is run without any command-line arguments.
.sp
.LP
Both the interactive and non-interactive forms of \fBkclient\fR can add the \fBhost/fqdn\fR entry to the local host's \fBkeytab\fR file. They also can require the user to enter the password for the administrative user requested, to obtain the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for \fBadminuser\fR. The \fBhost/fqdn\fR, \fBnfs/fqdn\fR, and \fBroot/fqdn\fR principals can be added to the KDC database (if not already present) before their possible addition to the local host's \fBkeytab\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBkclient\fR utility assumes that the local host has been setup for DNS and requires the presence of a valid \fBresolv.conf\fR(4). Also, \fBkclient\fR can fail if the localhost time is not synchronized with that of the KDC. For Kerberos to function the localhost time must be within five minutes of that of the KDC. It is advised that both systems run some form of time synchronization protocol, such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP). See the \fBntpd\fR man page, delivered in the \fBSUNWntpu\fR package (not a SunOS man page).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The non-interactive mode supports the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set up the machine for kerberized NFS. This involves making changes to \fBkrb5*\fR security flavors in \fBnfssec.conf\fR(4). This option will also add \fBnfs/fqdn\fR and \fBroot/fqdn\fR entries to the local host's \fBkeytab\fR file if the \fB-K\fR option has not been specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR [ \fIrealm\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the Kerberos realm.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIkdc_list\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fB-k\fR option specifies the KDC host names for the Kerberos client. \fIkdc_list\fR is a comma-separated list of KDCs. If the \fB-m\fR option is not used, it is assumed that the first (or only) host in \fIkdc_list\fR is the master KDC host name. Note that the list specified is used verbatim. This is helpful when specifying non-fully qualified KDC host names that can be canonicalized by DNS.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fIkdc_vendor\fR\fR

.RE

Knowing the administrative password will be required to associate the client with the server if the \fBms_ad\fR option is specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR [ \fIfilepath\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the pathname to the \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) master file, to be copied over to the local host. The path specified normally points to a master copy on a remote host and brought over to the local host by means of NFS.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR [ \fIdnsarg\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the DNS lookup option to be used and specified in the \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) file. Valid \fIdnsarg\fR entries are: \fBnone\fR, \fBdns_lookup_kdc\fR, \fBdns_lookup_realm\fR and \fBdns_fallback\fR. Any other entry is considered invalid. The latter three \fIdnsarg\fR values assume the same meaning as those described in \fBkrb5.conf\fR. \fBdns_lookup_kdc\fR implies DNS lookups for the KDC and the other servers. \fBdns_lookup_realm\fR is for host/domain name-to-realm mapping by means of DNS. \fBdns_fallback\fR is a superset and does DNS lookups for both the servers and the host/domain name-to-realm mapping. A lookup option of \fBnone\fR specifies that DNS is not be used for any kind of mapping lookup.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIdomain_list\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the host and/or domain names to be mapped to the Kerberos client's default realm name. \fIdomain_list\fR is a comma-separated list, for example "\fBexample.com,host1.example.com\fR". If the \fB-D\fR option is not used, then only the client's domain is used for this mapping. For example, if the client is \fBhost1.eng.example.com\fR, then the domain that is mapped to the \fBEXAMPLE.COM\fR realm is \fBexample.com\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-K\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Configure the Kerberos client without service keys, which are usually stored in \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR. This is useful in the following scenarios:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The client IP address is dynamically assigned and therefore does not host Kerberized services.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Client has a static IP address, but does not want to host any Kerberized services.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Client has a static IP address, but the local administrator does not currently have service keys available for the machine. It is expected that, at a later time, these keys will be installed on the machine.
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR [ \fIfqdn_list\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option creates a service principal entry (host/nfs/root) associated with each of the listed fqdn's, if required, and subsequently adds the entries to the local host's \fBkeytab\fR.
.sp
\fIfqdn_list\fR is a comma-separated list of one or more fully qualified DNS domain names.
.sp
This option is especially useful in Kerberos realms having systems offering kerberized services, but situated in multiple different DNS domains.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fIlogical_host_name\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies that the Kerberos client is a node in a cluster. The \fIlogical_host_name\fR is the logical host name given to the cluster. The resulting \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.conf\fR and \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR files must be manually copied over to the other members of the cluster.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImaster_kdc\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option specifies the master KDC to be used by the Kerberos client. \fImaster_kdc\fR is the host name of the master KDC for the client. If the \fB-m\fR option is not used, then it is assumed that the first KDC host name listed with the \fB-k\fR option is the master KDC.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR [ \fIprofile\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the profile to be used to enable the reading in of the values of all the parameters required for setup of the machine as a Kerberos client.
.sp
The profile should have entries in the format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIPARAM\fR \fI<value>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Valid \fIPARAM\fR entries are: \fBREALM\fR, \fBKDC\fR, \fBADMIN\fR, \fBFILEPATH\fR, \fBNFS\fR, \fBDNSLOOKUP\fR, \fBFQDN\fR, \fBNOKEY\fR, \fBNOSOL\fR, \fBLHN\fR, \fBKDCVENDOR\fR, \fBRMAP\fR, \fBMAS\fR, and \fBPAM\fR.
.sp
These profile entries correspond to the \fB-R\fR [\fIrealm\fR], \fB-k\fR [\fIkdc\fR], \fB-a\fR [\fIadminuser\fR], \fB-c\fR [\fIfilepath\fR], \fB-n\fR, \fB-d\fR [\fIdnsarg\fR], \fB-f\fR [\fIfqdn_list\fR], \fB-K\fR, \fB-h\fR [\fIlogical_host_name\fR], \fB-T\fR [\fIkdc_vendor\fR], \fB-D\fR [\fIdomain_list\fR], \fB-m\fR [\fImaster_kdc\fR], and \fB-s\fR [\fIpam_service\fR] command-line options, respectively. Any other \fIPARAM\fR entry is considered invalid and is ignored.
.sp
The NFS profile entry can have a value of 0 (do nothing) or 1 (operation is requested). Any other value is considered invalid and is ignored.
.sp
Keep in mind that the command line options override the \fIPARAM\fR values listed in the profile. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIpam_service\fR:\fIauth_type\fR[,...]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies that the PAM service names, listed in \fIpam_service\fR, are authenticated through Kerberos. Using this option updates \fBpam.conf\fR(4) to include a separate  authentication stack with \fBpam_krb5\fR(5).  Examples of \fIpam_service\fR names are \fBsshd-kbdint\fR, \fBxscreensaver\fR, and so forth.
.sp
\fIauth_type\fR can be one of the following keywords:
.sp

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSetting Up a Kerberos Client Using Command-Line Options
.sp
.LP
To setup a Kerberos client using the \fBclntconfig/admin\fR administrative principal for realm \fB\&'ABC.COM', kdc `example1.com'\fR and that also does kerberized NFS, enter:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# /usr/sbin/kclient -n -R ABC.COM -k example1.com -a clntconfig
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Alternatively, to set up a Kerberos client using the \fBclntconfig/admin\fR administrative principal for the realm \fB`EAST.ABC.COM', kdc `example2.east.abc.com'\fR and that also needs service principal(s) created and/or added to the local \fBkeytab\fR for multiple DNS domains, enter:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# /usr/sbin/kclient -n -R EAST.ABC.COM -k example2.east.abc.com \e
-f west.abc.com,central.abc.com -a clntconfig
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note that the \fBkrb5\fR administrative principal used by the administrator needs to have only \fBadd\fR, \fBinquire\fR, \fBchange-pwd\fR and \fBmodify\fR privileges (for the principals in the KDC database) in order for the \fBkclient\fR utility to run. A sample \fBkadm5.acl\fR(4) entry is:

.sp
.LP
To setup a Kerberos client using the \fBclntconfig/admin\fR administrative principal for realm \fB`ABC.COM', kdc `example1.com'\fR and that also copies over the master \fBkrb5.conf\fR from a specified location, enter:

.sp

\fBExample 3 \fRSetting Up a Kerberos Client That Has a Dynamic IP Address
.sp
.LP
In this example a Kerberos client is a DHCP client that has a dynamic IP address. This client does not wish to host any Kerberized services and therefore does not require a \fBkeytab\fR (\fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR) file.

.sp
.LP
For this type of client the administrator would issue the following command to configure this machine to be a Kerberos client of the \fBABC.COM\fR realm with the KDC server \fBkdc1.example.com\fR:

.sp
.in +2

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBfqdn\fR stands for the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the local host. The \fBkclient\fR utility saves copies of both the \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) and \fBnfssec.conf\fR(4) files to files with corresponding names and \fB\&.sav\fR extensions. The optional copy of the \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4) master file is neither encrypted nor integrity-protected and it takes place over regular NFS.
