.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBipmpstat\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIfield\fR[,...] [\fB-P\fR]] \fB-a\fR|\fB-g\fR|\fB-i\fR|\fB-p\fR|\fB-t\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipmpstat\fR command concisely displays information about the IPMP subsystem. It supports five different output modes, each of which provides a different view of the IPMP subsystem (address, group, interface, probe, and target), described below. At most one output mode may be specified per invocation, and the displayed information is guaranteed to be self-consistent. It also provides a parseable output format which may be used by scripts to examine the state of the IPMP subsystem. Only basic privileges are needed to invoke \fBipmpstat\fR, with the exception of probe mode which requires all privileges.
.SH OPTIONS

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR

.RE

.SH OUTPUT MODES
.sp
.LP
The \fBipmpstat\fR utility supports the output modes listed below. Note that these modes map to some of the options described above.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBAddress Mode\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Address mode displays the state of all IPMP data addresses on the system. The following output fields are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBADDRESS\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The hostname (or IP address) associated with the information. Note that because duplicate down addresses may exist, the address must be taken together with the \fBGROUP\fR to form a unique identity. For a given IPMP group, if duplicate addresses exist, at most one will be displayed, and an up address will always take precedence.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The state of the address. Either \fBup\fR if the address is \fBIFF_UP\fR (see \fBifconfig\fR(1M)), or \fBdown\fR if the address is not \fBIFF_UP\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The IPMP IP interface hosting the address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBINBOUND\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The underlying IP interface that will receive packets for this address. This may change in response to external events such as IP interface failure. If this field is empty, then the system will not accept IP packets sent to this address (for example, because the address is down or because there are no active IP interfaces left in the IPMP group).

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBOUTBOUND\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The underlying IP interfaces that will send packets using this source address. This may change in response to external events such as IP interface failure. If this field is empty, then the system will not send packets with this address as a source (for example, because the address is down or because there are no active IP interfaces left in the IPMP group).

ICMP probes are sent from active interfaces; the numeric identifier of the probe is incremented for each IP probe sent by \fBin.mpathd\fR over a given active interface. The numeric identifier matches the \fBicmp_seq\fR field of the ICMP probe packet and can be used for a more detailed analysis by packet monitoring tools.
.sp
When the IPMP group does not have any \fBNOFAILOVER\fR test addresses configured on any of the interfaces in the group, transitive probes are sent from all interfaces that are not actively being used for receiving data packets. The numeric identifier of transitive probes is incremented for each transitive probe sent from a given interface. The format of a probe packet is internal to the implementation.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBipmpstat\fR uses a human-friendly tabular format for its output modes, where each row contains one or more fields of information about a given object, which is in turn uniquely identified by one or more of those fields. In this format, a header identifying the fields is displayed above the table (and after each screenful of information), fields are separated by whitespace, empty fields are represented by \fB--\fR (double hyphens), and other visual aids are used. If the value for a field cannot be determined, its value will be displayed as "\fB?\fR" and a diagnostic message will be output to standard error.
.sp
.LP
Machine-parseable format also uses a tabular format, but is designed to be efficient to programmatically parse. Specifically, machine-parseable format differs from human-friendly format in the following ways:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
No headers are displayed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Fields with empty values yield no output, rather than showing \fB--\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Fields are separated by a single colon (\fB:\fR), rather than variable amounts of whitespace.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If multiple fields are requested, and a literal \fB:\fR or a backslash (\fB\e\fR) occur in a field's value, they are escaped by prefixing them with \fB\e\fR\&.
