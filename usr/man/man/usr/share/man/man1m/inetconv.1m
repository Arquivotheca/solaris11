.SH NAME
inetconv \- convert \fBinetd.conf\fR entries into smf service manifests, import them into smf repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBinetconv\fR \fB-?\fR

.LP
.nf
\fBinetconv\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-i\fR \fIsrcfile\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIdestdir\fR]

\fBinetconv\fR \fB-e\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-i\fR \fIsrcfile\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBinetconv\fR utility converts a file containing records of \fBinetd.conf\fR(4) into \fBsmf\fR(5) service manifests, and then import those manifests into the \fBsmf\fR repository. Once the \fBinetd.conf\fR file has been converted, the only way to change aspects of an inet service is to use the \fBinetadm\fR(1M) utility.
.sp
.LP
There is a one-to-one correspondence between a service line in the input file and the manifest generated. By default, the manifests are named using the following template:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<svcname>\fR-\fI<proto>\fR\fB\&.xml\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fI<svcname>\fR token is replaced by the service's name and the \fI<proto>\fR token by the service's protocol. Any slash (\fB/\fR) characters that exist in the source line for the service name or protocol are replaced with underscores (\fB_\fR).
.sp
.LP
The service line is recorded as a property of the converted service.
.sp
.LP
During the conversion process, if a service line is found to be malformed or to be for an internal \fBinetd\fR service, no manifest is generated and that service line is skipped.
.sp
.LP
The input file is left untouched by the conversion process.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-?\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display a usage message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Enable \fBsmf\fR services which are listed in the input file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
If a service manifest of the same name as the one to be generated is found in the destination directory, \fBinetconv\fR will overwrite that manifest if this option is specified. Otherwise, an error message is generated and the conversion of that service is not performed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIsrcfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Permits the specification of an alternate input file \fIsrcfile\fR. If this option is not specified, then the \fBinetd.conf\fR(4) file is used as input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Turns off the auto-import of the manifests generated during the conversion process. Later, if you want to import a generated manifest into the \fBsmf\fR(5) repository, you can do so through the use of the \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) utility.
.sp
If the \fB-e\fR option is specified, the \fB-n\fR option only displays the \fBsmf\fR services that would be enabled.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Permits the specification of an alternate destination directory \fIdestdir\fR for the generated manifests. If this option is not specified, then the manifests are placed in \fB/lib/svc/manifest/network/rpc\fR, if the service is a RPC service, or \fB/lib/svc/manifest/network\fR otherwise.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRGenerating \fBsmf\fR Manifests from \fBinetd.conf\fR
.sp
.LP
The following command generates \fBsmf\fR(5) manifests from \fBinetd.conf\fR(4) and places them in \fB/var/tmp\fR, overwriting any preexisting manifests of the same name, and then imports them into the \fBsmf\fR repository.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# inetconv -f -o /var/tmp
100232/10 -> /var/tmp/100232_10-rpc_udp.xml
Importing 100232_10-rpc_udp.xml ...Done
telnet -> /var/tmp/telnet-tcp6.xml
Importing telnet-tcp6.xml ...Done
.fi
.in -2

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRGenerating Manifests from an Alternate Input File
.sp
.LP
The following command specifies a different input file and does not load the resulting manifests into the \fBsmf\fR repository.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# inetconv -n -i /export/test/inet.svcs -o /var/tmp
100232/10 -> /var/tmp/100232_10-rpc_udp.xml
telnet -> /var/tmp/telnet-tcp6.xml
.fi
.in -2
