With \fB-r\fR only, limit the display of routes to those matching the specified filter. A filter rule consists of a \fIkeyword\fR:\fIvalue\fR pair. The known keywords and the value syntax are:
.sp

Selects an output interface. You can specify the interface by name (such as \fBhme0\fR) or by \fBifIndex\fR number (for example, \fB2\fR). If \fBany\fR is used, the filter matches all routes having a specified interface (anything other than null). If \fBnone\fR is used, the filter matches all routes having a null interface. Note that you can view the index number (\fIifIndex\fR) for an interface with the \fB-a\fR option of \fBifconfig\fR(1M).

.RS 4n
Selects a destination IP address. If specified with a mask length, then any routes with matching or longer (more specific) masks are selected. If \fBany\fR is used, then all but addresses but 0 are selected. If \fBnone\fR is used, then address 0 is selected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBflags:\fR[\fB+ -\fR]?[\fBABDGHLMSU\fR]\fB+\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Selects routes tagged with the specified flags. By default, the flags as specified must be set in order to match. With a leading \fB+\fR, the flags specified must be set but others are ignored. With a leading \fB-\fR, the flags specified must not be set and others are permitted.
.RE

You can specify multiple instances of \fB-f\fR to specify multiple filters. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% netstat -nr -f outif:hme0 -f outif:hme1 -f dst:10.0.0.0/8
.fi
.in -2

The display for each active socket shows the local and remote address, the send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), the send and receive windows (in bytes), and the internal state of the protocol.
.sp
.LP
The symbolic format normally used to display socket addresses is either:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBhostname\fR.\fIport\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
when the name of the host is specified, or
.sp

.nf
\fInetwork\fR.\fIport\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
if a socket address specifies a network but no specific host.
.sp
.LP
The numeric host address or network number associated with the socket is used to look up the corresponding symbolic hostname or network name in the \fIhosts\fR or \fInetworks\fR database.
.sp
.LP
If the network or hostname for an address is not known, or if the \fB-n\fR option is specified, the numerical network address is shown. Unspecified, or "wildcard", addresses and ports appear as an asterisk (\fB*\fR). For more information regarding the Internet naming conventions, refer to \fBinet\fR(7P) and \fBinet6\fR(7P).

The IPv6 and ICMPv6 protocol layers maintain per-interface statistics. If the \fB-a\fR option is specified with the \fB-s\fR option, then the per-interface statistics as well as the total sums are displayed. Otherwise, just the sum of the statistics are shown.
.sp
.LP
For the second, third, and fourth forms of the command, you must specify at least \fB-g\fR, \fB-p\fR, or \fB-s\fR. You can specify any combination of these options. You can also specify \fB-m\fR (the fifth form) with any set of the \fB-g\fR, \fB-p\fR, and \fB-s\fR options. If you specify more than one of these options, \fBnetstat\fR displays the information for each one of them.
.SS "Interface Status (Sixth Form)"
.sp
.LP
The interface status display lists information for all current interfaces, one interface per line. If an interface is specified using the \fB-I\fR option, it displays information for only the specified interface.
.sp
.LP
The list consists of the interface name, \fBmtu\fR (maximum transmission unit, or maximum packet size)(see \fBifconfig\fR(1M)), the network to which the interface is attached, addresses for each interface, and counter associated with the interface. The counters show the number of input packets, input errors, output packets, output errors, and collisions, respectively. For Point-to-Point interfaces, the Net/Dest field is the name or address on the other side of the link.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-a\fR option is specified with either the \fB-i\fR option or the \fB-I\fR option, then the output includes names of the physical interface(s), counts for input packets and output packets for each logical interface, plus additional information.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-n\fR option is specified, the list displays the IP address instead of the interface name.
.sp
.LP
If an optional \fIinterval\fR is specified, the output will be continually displayed in \fIinterval\fR seconds until interrupted by the user or until \fIcount\fR is reached. See OPERANDS.
.sp
.LP
The physical interface is specified using the \fB-I\fR option. When used with the \fIinterval\fR operand, output for the \fB-I\fR option has the following format:

Packet counts are maintained for the number of packets sent, the number of packets received, and the number of lease offers declined by the \fBDHCP\fR client. All three counters are initialized to zero and then incremented while obtaining a lease. The counters are reset when the period of lease renewal begins for the interface. Thus, the counters represent either the number of packets sent, received, and declined while obtaining the current lease, or the number of packets sent, received, and declined while attempting to obtain a future lease.
.SS "Destination Cache Entry Table (Tenth Form)"
.sp
.LP
The destination cache entry display shows the recorded path MTU, the age (in seconds) of the entry, and flags. The \fBP\fR flag indicates that a path MTU is recorded. The \fBS\fR flag indicates that the path MTU is smaller than the minumum that IP will allow. The \fBU\fR flag indicates that some transport metrics (round-trip time, and so forth) are cached in the destination cache entry.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When displaying interface information, \fBnetstat\fR honors the \fBDEFAULT_IP\fR setting in \fB/etc/default/inet_type\fR. If it is set to \fBIP_VERSION4\fR, then \fBnetstat\fR will omit information relating to IPv6 interfaces, statistics, connections, routes and the like.
.sp
.LP
However, you can override the \fBDEFAULT_IP\fR setting in \fB/etc/default/inet_type\fR on the command-line. For example, if you have used the command-line to explicitly request IPv6 information by using the \fBinet6\fR address family or one of the IPv6 protocols, it will override the \fBDEFAULT_IP\fR setting.
.sp
.LP
If you need to examine network status information following a kernel crash, use the \fBmdb\fR(1) utility on the \fBsavecore\fR(1M) output.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnetstat\fR utility obtains TCP statistics from the system by opening \fB/dev/tcp\fR and issuing queries. Because of this, \fBnetstat\fR might display an extra, unused connection in \fBIDLE\fR state when reporting connection status.
.sp
.LP
Previous versions of \fBnetstat\fR had undocumented methods for reporting kernel statistics published using the \fBkstat\fR(7D) facility. This functionality has been removed. Use \fBkstat\fR(1M) instead.
.sp
.LP
\fBnetstat\fR restricts its output to information that is relevant to the zone in which \fBnetstat\fR runs. (This is true for both shared-IP and exclusive-IP zones.)
