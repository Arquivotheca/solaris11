.SH NAME
shutdown \- shut down system, change system state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/shutdown\fR [\fB-y\fR] [\fB-g\fR \fIgrace-period\fR] [\fB-r\fR | \fB-i\fR \fIinit-state\fR] 
     [\fImessage\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBshutdown\fR is executed by the super user to change the state of the machine. In most cases, it is used to change from the multi-user state (state 2) to another state.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBshutdown\fR brings the system to a state where only the console has access to the operating system. This state is called single-user.
.sp
.LP
Before starting to shut down daemons and killing processes, \fBshutdown\fR sends a warning message and, by default, a final message asking for confirmation. \fImessage\fR is a string that is sent out following the standard warning message: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
The system will be shut down in .\|.\|.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the string contains more than one word, it should be contained within single (\fB\&'\fR) or double (\fB"\fR) quotation marks.
.sp
.LP
The warning message and the user provided \fImessage\fR are output when there are 7200, 3600, 1800, 1200, 600, 300, 120, 60, and 30 seconds remaining before \fBshutdown\fR begins. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR.

System state definitions are:
.sp
.ne 2

.na
\fBstate 0\fR
.ad
.RS 14n

Stop the operating system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBstate 1\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
State 1 is referred to as the administrative state. In state 1 file systems required for multi-user operations are mounted, and logins requiring access to multi-user file systems can be used. When the system comes up from firmware mode into state 1, only the console is active and other multi-user (state 2) services are unavailable. Note that not all user processes are stopped when transitioning from multi-user state to state 1.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBstate s, S\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
State s (or S) is referred to as the single-user state. All user processes are stopped on transitions to this state. In the single-user state, file systems required for multi-user logins are unmounted and the system can only be accessed through the console. Logins requiring access to multi-user file systems cannot be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBstate 5\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Shut the machine down so that it is safe to remove the power. Have the machine remove power, if possible. The \fBrc0\fR procedure is called to perform this task.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBstate 6\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Stop the operating system and reboot to the state defined by the \fBinitdefault\fR entry in \fB/etc/inittab\fR. The \fBrc6\fR procedure is called to perform this task.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When a system transitions down to the \fBS\fR or \fBs\fR state, the \fB/etc/nologin\fR file (see \fBnologin\fR(4)) is created. Upon subsequent transition to state 2 (multi-user state), this file is removed by a script in the \fB/etc/rc2.d\fR directory.
