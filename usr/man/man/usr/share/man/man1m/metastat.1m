.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmetastat\fR command displays the current status for each metadevice (including stripes, concatenations, concatenations of stripes, mirrors, RAID5, soft partitions, and trans devices) or hot spare pool, or of specified metadevices, components, or hot spare pools.
.sp
.LP
It is helpful to run the \fBmetastat\fR command after using the \fBmetattach\fR command to view the status of the metadevice.
.sp
.LP
\fBmetastat\fR displays the state of each Solaris Volume Manager RAID-1 volume on the system. The possible states include:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBOkay\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The device reports no errors.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBNeeds maintenance\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A problem has been detected. This requires that the system administrator replace the failed physical device. Volumes displaying \fBNeeds maintenance\fR have incurred no data loss, although additional failures could risk data loss. Take action as quickly as possible.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLast erred\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A problem has been detected. Data loss is a possibility. This might occur if a component of a submirror fails and is not replaced by a hot spare, therefore going into \fBNeeds maintenance\fR state. If the corresponding component also fails, it would go into \fBLast erred\fR state and, as there is no remaining valid data source, data loss could be a possibility.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBUnavailable\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
A device cannot be accessed, but has not incurred errors. This might occur if a physical device has been removed with Solaris Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR) features, thus leaving the Solaris Volume Manager volume unavailable. It could also occur if an array or disk is powered off at system initialization, or if a >1TB volume is present when the system is booted in 32-bit mode.
.sp
After the storage has been made available, run the \fBmetastat\fR command with the \fB-i\fR option to update the status of the metadevices. This clears the unavailable state for accessible devices. 
.RE

.sp
.LP
See the \fI\fR for instructions on replacing disks and handling volumes in Needs maintenance or Last erred states.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display all disk sets. Only metadevices in disk sets that are owned by the current host are displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display the current status of all of the 64-bit metadevices and hot spares.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display concise output. 
.sp
There is one line of output for each metadevice. The output shows the basic structure and the error status, if any, for each metadevice.
.sp
The \fB-c\fR output format is distinct from the \fB-p\fR output format. The \fB-p\fR option does not display metadevice status and is not intended as human-readable output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display the current status of all of the descriptive name metadevices and hotspares.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display usage message.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Check the status of RAID-1 (mirror) volumes, RAID-5 volumes, and hot spares. The inquiry checks each metadevice for accessibility, starting at the top level metadevice. When problems are discovered, the metadevice state databases are updated as if an error had occurred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display the list of active metadevices and hot spare pools in the same format as \fBmd.tab\fR. See \fBmd.tab\fR(4).
.sp
The \fB-p\fR output is designed for snapshotting the configuration for later recovery or setup.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display the status for metadevices without the device relocation information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fB\fIsetname\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Specify the name of the disk set on which \fBmetastat\fR works. Using the \fB-s\fR option causes the command to perform its administrative function within the specified disk set. Without this option, the command performs its function on metadevices and hot spare pools in the local disk set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Display the current status and timestamp for the specified metadevices and hot spare pools. The timestamp provides the date and time of the last state change.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcomponent\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Display the status of the component hosting a soft partition, including extents, starting blocks, and block count.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIhot_spare_pool\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Display the status of the specified hot spare pool(s).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fImetadevice\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Display the status of the specified metadevice(s). If a trans metadevice is specified, the status of the master and log devices is also displayed. Trans metadevices have been replaced by UFS logging. See \fBNOTES\fR.

\fBmetastat\fR displays states as of the time the command is entered. It is unwise to use the output of the \fBmetastat\fR \fB-p\fR command to create a \fBmd.tab\fR(4) file for a number of reasons:
