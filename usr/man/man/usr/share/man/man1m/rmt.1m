.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/rmt\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrmt\fR is a program used by the remote dump and restore programs in manipulating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess communication connection. \fBrmt\fR is normally started up with an \fBrexec\fR(3SOCKET) or \fBrcmd\fR(3SOCKET) call.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrmt\fR program accepts requests that are specific to the manipulation of magnetic tapes, performs the commands, then responds with a status indication.  All responses are in \fBASCII\fR and in one of two forms. Successful commands have responses of: 
.sp
.in +2

.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBA\fR\fInumber\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
where \fInumber\fR is an \fBASCII\fR representation of a decimal number. 
.RE

.sp
.LP
Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBE\fR\fIerror-number\fR\fB\en\fR\fIerror-message\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
where \fIerror-number\fR is one of the possible error numbers described in \fBintro\fR(3), and \fIerror-message\fR is the corresponding error string as printed from a call to \fBperror\fR(3C).
.RE

.LP
 The protocol consists of the following commands:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBS\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Return the status of the open device, as obtained with a \fBMTIOCGET\fR \fBioctl\fR call.  If the operation was successful, an "ack" is sent with the size of the status buffer, then the status buffer is sent (in binary).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBC\fR\fIdevice\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Close the currently open device. The \fIdevice\fR specified is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBI\fR\fIoperation\fR\fB\en\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Perform a \fBMTIOCOP\fR \fBioctl\fR(2) command using the specified parameters. The parameters are interpreted as the \fBASCII\fR representations of the decimal values to place in the \fImt_op\fR and \fImt_count\fR fields of the structure used in the \fBioctl\fR call.   When the operation is successful the return value is the \fIcount\fR parameter.

\fB\fBL\fR\fIoffset\fR\fB\en\fR\fBwhence\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Perform an \fBlseek\fR(2) operation using the specified parameters. The response value is returned from the \fBlseek\fR call.
.RE

.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fBO\fR\fIdevice\fR\fB\en\fR\fImode\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Open the specified \fIdevice\fR using the indicated \fImode\fR. \fIdevice\fR is a full pathname, and \fImode\fR is an \fBASCII\fR representation of a decimal number suitable for passing to \fBopen\fR(9E). If a device is already open, it is closed before a new open is performed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBR\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Read \fIcount\fR bytes of data from the open device. \fBrmt\fR performs the requested \fBread\fR(9E) and responds with \fBA\fR\fIcount-read\en\fR if the read was successful; otherwise an error in  standard format is returned. If the read was successful, the data read is sent.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBW\fR\fIcount\fR\fB\en\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Write data onto the open device. \fBrmt\fR reads \fIcount\fR bytes from the connection, aborting if a premature \fBEOF\fR is encountered. The response value is returned from the \fBwrite\fR(9E) call.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Any other command causes \fBrmt\fR to exit.
