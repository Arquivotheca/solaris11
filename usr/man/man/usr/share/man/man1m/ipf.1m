.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipf\fR utility is part of a suite of commands associated with the Solaris IP Filter feature. See \fBipfilter\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The \fBipf\fR utility opens the filenames listed (treating a hyphen (\fB-\fR) as stdin) and parses the file for a set of rules which are to be added or removed from the packet filter rule set.
.sp
.LP
If there are no parsing problems, each rule processed by \fBipf\fR is added to the kernel's internal lists. Rules are added to the end of the internal lists, matching the order in which they appear when given to \fBipf\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBipf\fR's use is restricted through access to \fB/dev/ipauth\fR, \fB/dev/ipl\fR, and \fB/dev/ipstate\fR. The default permissions of these files require \fBipf\fR to be run as root for all operations.
.SS "Enabling Solaris IP Filter Feature"
.sp
.LP
Solaris IP Filter is installed with the Solaris operating system. However, packet filtering is not enabled by default. Use the following procedure to activate the Solaris IP Filter feature.
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Assume a role that includes the IP Filter Management rights profile (see \fBrbac\fR(5)) or become superuser.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Configure system and services' firewall policies. See \fBsvc.ipfd\fR(1M) and \fBipf\fR(4).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
(Optional) Create a network address translation (NAT) configuration file. See \fBipnat.conf\fR(4).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
(Optional) Create an address pool configuration file. See \fBippool\fR(4).
.sp
Create an \fBipool.conf\fR file if you want to refer to a group of addresses as a single address pool. If you want the address pool configuration file to be loaded at boot time, create a file called \fB/etc/ipf/ippool.conf\fR in which to put the address pool. If you do not want the address pool configuration file to be loaded at boot time, put the \fBippool.conf\fR file in a location other than \fB/etc/ipf\fR and manually activate the rules.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
Enable Solaris IP Filter, as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvcadm enable network/ipfilter\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE
.sp
.LP
To re-enable packet filtering after it has been temporarily disabled either reboot the machine or enter the following command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvcadm enable network/ipfilter\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...which essentially executes the following \fBipf\fR commands:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Enable Solaris IP Filter:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBipf -E\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

2.
Load \fBippools\fR:

.in -2
.sp

See \fBippool\fR(1M).
.RE

3.
(Optional) Activate packet filtering:
.sp
.in +2

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-6\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option is required to parse IPv6 rules and to have them loaded. Loading of IPv6 rules is subject to change in the future.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the list to make changes to the active list (default).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Turn debug mode on. Causes a hex dump of filter rules to be generated as it processes each one.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable the filter (if enabled). Not effective for loadable kernel versions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable the filter (if disabled). Not effective for loadable kernel versions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fBi\fR | \fBo\fR | \fBa\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies which filter list to flush. The parameter should either be \fBi\fR (input), \fBo\fR (output) or \fBa\fR (remove all filter rules). Either a single letter or an entire word starting with the appropriate letter can be used. This option can be before or after any other, with the order on the command line determining that used to execute options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fBs\fR | \fBS\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
To flush entries from the state table, use the \fB-F\fR option in conjuction with either \fBs\fR (removes state information about any non-fully established connections) or \fBS\fR (deletes the entire state table). You can specify only one of these two options. A fully established connection will show up in \fBipfstat\fR \fB-s\fR output as \fB4/4\fR, with deviations either way indicating the connection is not fully established.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies which files \fBipf\fR should use to get input from for modifying the packet filter rule lists.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-I\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the list to make changes to the inactive list.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fBpass\fR | \fBblock\fR | \fBnomatch\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Toggles default logging of packets. Valid arguments to this option are \fBpass\fR, \fBblock\fR and \fBnomatch\fR. When an option is set, any packet which exits filtering and matches the set category is logged. This is most useful for causing all packets that do not match any of the loaded rules to be logged.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows run-time changing of IPFilter kernel variables. To allow for changing, some variables require IPFilter to be in a disabled state (\fB-D\fR), others do not. The \fIoptionlist\fR parameter is a comma-separated list of tuning commands. A tuning command is one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
