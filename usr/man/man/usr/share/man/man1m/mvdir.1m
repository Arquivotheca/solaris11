mvdir \- move a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/mvdir\fR \fIdirname\fR \fIname\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmvdir\fR moves directories within a file system. \fBdirname\fR must be a directory. If \fIname\fR does not exist, it will be created as a directory. If \fIname\fR does exist, and is a directory, \fBdirname\fR will be created as \fIname/dirname\fR. \fBdirname\fR and  \fIname\fR may not be on the same path; that is, one may not be subordinate to the other. For example:
.sp
.LP
\fBexample%\fR \fBmvdir\fR \fBx/y\fR \fBx/z\fR
.sp
.LP
is legal, but
.sp
.LP
\fBexample%\fR \fBmvdir\fR \fBx/y\fR \fBx/y/z\fR
.sp
.LP
is not.
