.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected by gateways. Tracking the route a packet follows can be difficult. The utility \fBtraceroute\fR traces the route that an \fBIP\fR packet follows to another internet host.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtraceroute\fR utility utilizes the both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Use the \fB-A\fR option to override the default behavior. \fBtraceroute\fR uses the IPv4 protocol \fIttl\fR (time to live) field or the IPv6 field \fIhop limit\fR. It attempts to elicit an \fBICMP\fR or \fBICMP6\fR \fBTIME_EXCEEDED\fR response from each \fIgateway\fR along the path, and a \fBPORT_UNREACHABLE\fR(or \fBECHO_REPLY\fR if \fB-I\fR is used) response from the destination host. It starts by sending probes with a \fIttl\fR or \fIhop limit\fR of \fB1\fR and increases by \fB1\fR until it either gets to the host, or it hits the maximum \fImax_hop\fR. The default maximum \fImax_hop\fR is 30 hops, but this can be set by the \fB-m\fR option.
.sp
.LP
Three probes are sent at each \fIttl\fR (\fIhop limit\fR) setting, and a line is printed showing the \fIttl\fR (\fIhop limit\fR), the hostname and the address of the gateway, and the \fIrtt\fR (round trip time) of each probe. The number of probes may be specifically set using the \fB-q\fR option. If the probe answers come from different gateways, the hostname and the address of each responding system will be printed. If there is no response within a 5 second timeout interval, an asterisk (\fB*\fR) is displayed for that probe. The \fB-w\fR option may be used to set the timeout interval. Other possible annotations that may appear after the time are:

.LP
If almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable code, then \fBtraceroute\fR gives up and exits. 
.sp
.LP
The destination \fIhost\fR is not supposed to process the \fBUDP\fR probe packets, so the destination \fIport\fR default is set to an unlikely value. However, if some application on the destination is using that value, the value of \fIport\fR can be changed with the \fB-p\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The only mandatory parameter is the destination \fIhost\fR name or \fBIP\fR number. The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes (60 bytes for IPv6), but this may be increased by specifying a packet length (in bytes) after the destination \fIhost\fR name. 
.sp
.LP
All integer arguments to \fBtraceroute\fR can be specified in either decimal or hexadecimal notation. For example, \fIpacketlen\fR can be specified either as \fB256\fR or \fB0x100\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\ \fIaddr_family\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the address family of the target host. \fIaddr_family\fR can be either \fBinet\fR or \fBinet6\fR. Address family determines which protocol to use. For an argument of \fBinet\fR, IPv4 is used. For \fBinet6\fR, IPv6 is used.
.sp
By default, if the name of a host is provided, not the literal \fBIP\fR address, and a valid IPv6 address exists in the name service database, \fBtraceroute\fR will use this address. Otherwise, if the name service database contains an IPv4 address, it will try the IPv4 address.
.sp
Specify the address family \fBinet\fR or \fBinet6\fR to override the default behavior. If the argument specified is \fBinet\fR, \fBtraceroute\fR will use the IPv4 address associated with the hostname. If none exists, \fBtraceroute\fR will state that the host is unknown and exit. It will not try to determine if an IPv6 address exists in the name service database.
.sp
If the specified argument is \fBinet6\fR, \fBtraceroute\fR will use the IPv6 address that is associated with the hostname. If none exists, \fBtraceroute\fR will state that the host is unknown and exit.

\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Probe all of the addresses of a multi-homed destination. The output looks like \fBtraceroute\fR has been run once for each \fBIP\fR address of the destination. If this option is used together with \fB-A\fR, \fBtraceroute\fR probes only the addresses that are of the specified address family. While probing one of the addresses of the destination, user can skip to the next address by sending a \fBSIGINT\fR, or exit \fBtraceroute\fR by sending a \fBSIGQUIT\fR signal. See \fBsignal\fR(3C)

\fB\fB-c\fR\ \fItraffic_class\fR\fR

.RS 4n
Specify the traffic class of probe packets. The value must be an integer in the range from 0 to 255. Gateways along the path may route the probe packet differently depending upon the value of \fItraffic_class\fR set in the probe packet. This option is valid only on IPv6.

Turn off fragmentation. For IPv4, this means setting the Don't Fragment bit. For IPv4 and IPv6, this means do not allow fragmentation as the datagrams are sent. If  the packetlen exceeds the MTU, then traceroute may report that sending failed due to Message too long.

Set the starting \fIttl\fR ( \fIhop limit\fR) value to \fIfirst_hop\fR, to override the default value \fB1\fR. \fBtraceroute\fR skips processing for those intermediate gateways which are less than \fIfirst_hop\fR hops away.

Specify a loose source route \fIgateway\fR. The user can specify more than one \fIgateway\fR by using \fB-g\fR for each gateway. The maximum number of gateways is 8 for IPv4 and 127 for IPv6. Note that some factors such as the link \fBMTU\fR can further limit the number of gateways for IPv6. This option cannot be used with the \fB-r\fR option.

For IPv4, this option specifies a network interface to obtain the source \fBIP\fR address. This is normally only useful on a multi-homed host. The \fB-s\fR option is also another way to do this. For IPv6, it specifies the network interface on which probe packets are transmitted. The argument can be either an interface index, for example, \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR, or an interface name, for example, \fBeri0\fR, \fBhme0\fR.

Specify a delay, in seconds, to pause between probe packets. This may be necessary if the final destination does not accept undeliverable packets in bursts. By default, \fBtraceroute\fR sends the next probe as soon as it has received a reply. Note that \fIpause_sec\fR is a real number.

\fB\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR\fR

Set the base \fBUDP\fR \fIport\fR number used in probes.The default is 33434. \fBtraceroute\fR hopes that nothing is listening on \fBUDP\fR \fIports\fR \fB(base+(nhops-1)*nqueries)\fR to \fB(base+(nhops*nqueries)-1)\fRat the destination host, so that an \fBICMP\fR (\fBICMP6\fR) \fBPORT_UNREACHABLE\fR message will be returned to terminate the route tracing. If something is listening on a \fIport\fR in the default range, this option can be used to select an unused \fIport\fR range. \fBnhops\fR is defined as the number of hops between the source and the destination.

Use the following address, which usually is given as a literal \fBIP\fR address, not a hostname, as the source address in outgoing probe packets. On multi-homed hosts, those with more than one \fBIP\fR address, this option can be used to force the source address to be something other than the \fBIP\fR address \fBtraceroute\fR picks by default. If the \fBIP\fR address is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent. For IPv4, when used together with the \fB-i\fR option, the given \fBIP\fR address should be configured on the specified interface. Otherwise, an error will be returned.
