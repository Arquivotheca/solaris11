.SH NAME
sulogin \- access single-user mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBsulogin\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsulogin\fR utility is automatically invoked by \fBinit\fR when the system is first started. It prompts the user to type a user name and password to enter system maintenance mode (single-user mode) or to type \fBEOF\fR (typically CTRL-D) for normal startup (multi-user mode). The user should never directly invoke \fBsulogin\fR. The user must have the \fBsolaris.system.maintenance\fR authorization.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsulogin\fR utility can prompt the user to enter the root password on a variable number of serial console devices, in addition to the traditional console device. See \fBconsadm\fR(1M) and \fBmsglog\fR(7D) for a description of how to configure a serial device to display the single-user login prompt.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
By default, the root user has all authorizations.
.sp
.LP
Granting the \fBsolaris.system.maintenance\fR authorization to the Console User Rights Profile may have an undesirable side effect of granting the currently logged in user maintenance mode access. The \fBsolaris.system.maintenance\fR authorization should be directly granted to appropriate users rather than through the Console User Rights Profile.
