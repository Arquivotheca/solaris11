.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmetadb\fR command creates and deletes replicas of the metadevice state database. State database replicas can be created on dedicated slices, or on slices that will later become part of a simple metadevice (concatenation or stripe) or RAID5 metadevice. Do not place state database replicas on fabric-attached storage, SANs, or other storage that is not directly attached to the system and available at the same point in the boot process as traditional SCSI or IDE drives. See \fBNOTES\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The metadevice state database contains the configuration of all metadevices and hot spare pools in the system. Additionally, the metadevice state database keeps track of the current state of metadevices and hot spare pools, and their components. Solaris Volume Manager automatically updates the metadevice state database when a configuration or state change occurs. A submirror failure is an example of a state change. Creating a new metadevice is an example of a configuration change.
.sp
.LP
The metadevice state database is actually a collection of multiple, replicated database copies. Each copy, referred to as a replica, is subject to strict consistency checking to ensure correctness.
.sp
.LP
Replicated databases have an inherent problem in determining which database has valid and correct data. To solve this problem, Volume Manager uses a \fImajority consensus algorithm\fR. This algorithm requires that a majority of the database replicas be available before any of them are declared valid. This algorithm strongly encourages the presence of at least three initial replicas, which you create. A consensus can then be reached as long as at least two of the three replicas are available. If there is only one replica and the system crashes, it is possible that all metadevice configuration data can be lost.
.sp
.LP
The majority consensus algorithm is conservative in the sense that it will fail if a majority consensus cannot be reached, even if one replica actually does contain the most up-to-date data. This approach guarantees that stale data will not be accidentally used, regardless of the failure scenario. The majority consensus algorithm accounts for the following: the system will stay running with exactly half or more replicas; the system will panic when less than half the replicas are available; the system will not reboot without one more than half the total replicas.
.sp
.LP
When used with no options, the \fBmetadb\fR command gives a short form of the status of the metadevice state database. Use \fBmetadb\fR \fB-i\fR for an explanation of the flags field in the output.
.sp
.LP
The initial state database is created using the \fBmetadb\fR command with both the \fB-a\fR and \fB-f\fR options, followed by the slice where the replica is to reside. The \fB-a\fR option specifies that a replica (in this case, the initial) state database should be created. The \fB-f\fR option forces the creation to occur, even though a state database does not exist. (The \fB-a\fR and \fB-f\fR options should be used together only when no state databases exist.)
.sp
.LP
Additional replicas beyond those initially created can be added to the system. They contain the same information as the existing replicas, and help to prevent the loss of the configuration information. Loss of the configuration makes operation of the metadevices impossible. To create additional replicas, use the \fBmetadb\fR \fB-a\fR command, followed by the name of the new slice(s) where the replicas will reside. All replicas that are located on the same slice must be created at the same time.
.sp
.LP
To delete all replicas that are located on the same slice, the \fBmetadb\fR \fB-d\fR command is used, followed by the slice name.
.sp
.LP
When used with the \fB-i\fR option, \fBmetadb\fR displays the status of the metadevice state databases. The status can change if a hardware failure occurs or when state databases have been added or deleted.
.sp
.LP
To fix a replica in an error state, delete the replica and add it back again.
.sp
.LP
The metadevice state database (\fBmddb\fR) also contains a list of the replica locations for this set (local or shared diskset).
.sp
.LP
The local set \fBmddb\fR can also contain host and drive information for each of the shared disksets of which this node is a member. Other than the diskset host and drive information stored in the local set \fBmddb\fR, the local and shared diskset \fBmddb\fRs are functionality identical.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmddb\fRs are written to during the resync of a mirror or during a component failure or configuration change. A configuration change or failure can also occur on a single replica (removal of a \fBmddb\fR or a failed disk) and this causes the other replicas to be updated with this failure information.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Root privileges are required for all of the following options except \fB-h\fR and \fB-i\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The following options can be used with the \fBmetadb\fR command. Not all the options are compatible on the same command line. Refer to the \fBSYNOPSIS\fR to see the supported use of the options.

.RS 4n
Attach a new database device. The \fB/kernel/drv/md.conf\fR file is automatically updated with the new information and the \fB/etc/lvm/mddb.cf\fR file is updated as well. An alternate way to create replicas is by defining them in the \fB/etc/lvm/md.tab\fR file and specifying the assigned name at the command line in the form, \fBmddb\fInn\fR\fR, where \fInn\fR is a two-digit number given to the replica definitions. Refer to the \fBmd.tab\fR(4) man page for instructions on setting up replicas in that file.

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBExample 1 \fRCreating Initial State Database Replicas
.sp
.LP
The following example creates the initial state database replicas on a new system.

.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fB-a\fR and \fB-f\fR options force the creation of the initial database and replicas. You could then create metadevices with these same slices, making efficient use of the system.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRAdding Two Replicas on Two New Disks

\fBExample 3 \fRDeleting Two Replicas
.sp
.LP
This example shows how to delete two replicas from the system. Assume that replicas have been set up on \fB/dev/dsk/c0t2d0s3\fR and \fB/dev/dsk/c1t1d0s3\fR.

Although you can delete all replicas, you should never do so while metadevices still exist. Removing all replicas causes existing metadevices to become inoperable.
