.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdns-sd\fR command is a network diagnostic tool, much like \fBping\fR(1M) or \fBtraceroute\fR(1M). However, unlike those tools, most of its functionality is not implemented in the \fBdns-sd\fR executable itself, but in library code that is available to any application. The library \fBAPI\fR that \fBdns-sd\fR uses is documented in \fB/usr/include/dns_sd.h\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdns-sd\fR command is primarily intended for interactive use. Because its command-line arguments and output format are subject to change, invoking it from a shell script can be unpredictable. Additionally, the asynchronous nature of \fBDNS\fR Service Discovery does not easily lend itself to script-oriented programming. This style of asynchronous interaction works best with applications that are either multi-threaded, or use a main event-handling loop to receive keystrokes, network data, and other asynchronous event notifications as they happen.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIname\fR \fItype\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIport\fR [\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR ...]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Register (advertise) a service in the specified domain with the given \fIname\fR and \fItype\fR as listening (on the current machine) on the specified \fIport\fR.
.sp
\fIname\fR can be any arbitrary unicode text, containing any legal unicode characters (including dots, spaces, slashes, colons, and so on without any restrictions), up to 63 \fBUTF-8\fR bytes long.
.sp
\fItype\fR must be of the form "_app-proto._tcp" or "_app-proto._udp", where "app-proto" is an application protocol name registered at \fBhttp://www.dns-sd.org\fR, under the service types (RFC 2782) link.
.sp
\fIdomain\fR is the domain in which to register the service. In current implementations, only the local multicast domain "local" is supported. In the future, registering will be supported in any arbitrary domain that has a working \fBDNS\fR Update server [\fBRFC\fR 2136]. The domain "." is a synonym for "pick a sensible default", which currently means "local".
.sp
\fIport\fR is a number from 0 to 65535, and is the \fBTCP\fR or \fBUDP\fR port number upon which the service is listening. Registering a service on port 0 allows an application to explicitly advertise the non-availability of a service.
.sp
Additional attributes of the service may optionally be described by \fIkey/value\fR pairs, which are stored in the advertised service's \fBDNS\fR \fBTXT\fR record. Allowable keys and values are listed with the service registration at \fBhttp://www.dns-sd.org\fR, under the service types (RFC 2782) link.

.RS 4n
Browse for instances of service \fItype\fR in \fIdomain\fR.
.sp
For valid types, see \fBhttp://www.dns-sd.org\fR, under the service types (RFC 2782) link. Omitting the domain name or using "." means "pick a sensible default."

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-L\fR \fIname\fR \fItype\fR \fIdomain\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Look up and display the information necessary to contact and use the named service. This information includes the hostname of the machine where that service is available, the port number on which the service is listening, and (if present) \fBTXT\fR record attributes describing properties of the service.
.sp
In a typical application, browsing happens rarely, while lookup (or "resolving") happens every time the service is used. For example, a user does not browse the network to pick a default printer that often, but once a default printer has been picked, that named service is resolved to its current IP address and port number every time the user presses Cmd-P to print.

Generic query for any resource record type and class. This option also reconfirms each result from the query. Reconfirming the record instructs \fBmdnsd\fR(1M) to verify the validity of the record. If the record is not valid \fBmdnsd\fR(1M) flushes the record from the daemon's cache and  also from other \fBmdnsd\fR(1M) caches on the network.

Register (advertise) a service in the specified domain with the given \fIname\fR and \fItype\fR listening on the specified port and accessible on another host.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAdvertising a printing service
.sp
.LP
The following command advertises the existence of \fBLPR\fR printing service on port 515 on this machine, so that it will be available to \fBDNS-SD\fR compatible printing clients:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
dns-sd -R "My Test" _printer._tcp. . 515 pdl=application/postscript
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For this registration to be useful, the LPR service should be available on port 515. Advertising a service that does not exist is not very useful.
.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRAdvertising a web page
.sp
.LP
The following command advertises a web page being served by an \fBHTTP\fR server on port 80 on this machine, so that it will appear on the Bonjour list in Safari and other DNS-SD compatible Web clients: 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
dns-sd -R "My Test" _http._tcp . 80 path=/path-to-page.html
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRFinding the advertised web pages on the local network
.sp
.LP
The following command finds the advertised web pages on the local network (the same list that Safari shows):

.sp
.in +2
.nf
dns-sd -B _http._tcp
.fi
.in -2
