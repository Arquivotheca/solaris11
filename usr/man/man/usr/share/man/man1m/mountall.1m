.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmountall\fR is used to mount file systems specified in a file system table. The file system table must be in \fBvfstab\fR(4) format. If no \fIfile_system_table\fR is specified, \fB/etc/vfstab\fR is used. If \(mi is specified as \fIfile_system_table\fR, \fBmountall\fR reads the file system table from the standard input. \fBmountall\fR mounts only those file systems with the \fBmount at boot\fR field set to \fByes\fR in the \fIfile_system_table\fR.
.sp
.LP
For each file system in the file system table, the following logic is executed: if there exists a file\fB/usr/lib/fs/\fIFSType\fR/fsckall\fR, where \fIFSType\fR is the type of the file system, save that file system in a list to be passed later, and all at once, as arguments to the \fB/usr/lib/fs/\fIFSType\fR/fsckall\fR script. The \fB/usr/lib/fs/\fIFSType\fR/fsckall\fR script checks all of the file systems in its argument list to determine whether they can be safely mounted. If no \fB/usr/lib/fs/\fIFSType\fR/fsckall\fR script exists for the \fIFSType\fR of the file system, the file system is individually checked using \fBfsck\fR(1M). If the file system does not appear mountable, it is fixed using \fBfsck\fR before the mount is attempted. File systems with a \(mi entry in the \fBfsckdev\fR field are mounted without first being checked.
.sp
.LP
\fBumountall\fR causes all mounted file systems in the current zone except \fBroot\fR, \fB/usr\fR, \fB/var\fR, \fB/var/adm\fR, \fB/var/run\fR, \fB/proc\fR, and \fB/dev/fd\fR to be unmounted. If the \fIFSType\fR is specified, \fBmountall\fR and \fBumountall\fR limit their actions to the \fIFSType\fR specified. There is no guarantee that \fBumountall\fR unmounts \fIbusy\fR file systems, even if the \fB-k\fR option is specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Specify the \fIFSType\fR of the file system to be mounted or unmounted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fIhost\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Unmount all file systems listed in \fB/etc/mnttab\fR that are remote-mounted from host.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Use the \fBfuser\fR \fB-k\fR \fImount-point\fR command. See the \fBfuser\fR(1M) for details. The \fB-k\fR option sends the \fBSIGKILL\fR signal to each process using the file. As this option spawns kills for each process, the kill messages might not show up immediately. There is no guarantee that \fBumountall\fR unmounts \fIbusy\fR file systems, even if the \fB-k\fR option is specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Limit the action to local file systems.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
List the actions that would be performed for the specified options, but do not actually execute these actions. Repeating the command without the \fB-n\fR option executes the listed actions, assuming that the \fB/etc/mnttab\fR file has not changed in the interval prior to repeating the command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Limit the action to remote file system types.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Do not perform the \fBumount\fR operation in parallel.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-Z\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Apply the action(s) only to the file systems  mounted in non-global zones. By default, \fBumountall\fR unmounts only file systems mounted in the current zone. Option \fB-Z\fR is ignored if used in a non-global zone.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
No messages are printed if the file systems are mountable and clean.
.sp
.LP
Error and warning messages come from \fBfsck\fR(1M) and \fBmount\fR(1M).
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
At this time, NFS is the only remote file system supported by the \fB-l\fR, \fB-r\fR, and \fB-h\fR options.
