.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBiostat\fR utility iteratively reports terminal, disk, and tape \fBI/O\fR activity, as well as \fBCPU\fR utilization. The first line of output is for all time since boot; each subsequent line is for the prior interval only.
.sp
.LP
To compute this information, the kernel maintains a number of counters. For each disk, the kernel counts reads, writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The kernel also takes hi-res time stamps at queue entry and exit points, which allows it to keep track of the residence time and cumulative residence-length product for each queue. Using these values, \fBiostat\fR produces highly accurate measures of throughput, utilization, queue lengths, transaction rates and service time. For terminals collectively, the kernel simply counts the number of input and output characters.
.sp
.LP
During execution of the kernel status command, the \fBstate\fR of the system can change. If relevant, a state change message is included in the \fBiostat\fR output, in one of the following forms:

The \fBsvc_t\fR output reports the overall \fBresponse\fR time, rather than the \fBservice\fR time, of a device. The overall time includes the time that transactions are in queue and the time that transactions are being serviced. The time spent in queue is shown with the \fB-x\fR option in the \fBwsvc_t\fR output column. The time spent servicing transactions is the true service time. Service time is also shown with the \fB-x\fR option and appears in the \fBasvc_t\fR output column of the same report.

By default, disks are identified by instance names such as \fBssd23\fR or \fBmd301\fR. Combining the \fB-n\fR option with the \fB-x\fR option causes disk names to display in the \fBcXtYdZsN\fR format which is more easily associated with physical hardware characteristics.

The sum of \fBCPU\fR utilization might vary slightly from 100 because of rounding errors in the production of a percentage figure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsvc_t\fR response time is not particularly significant when the \fBI/0\fR (\fBr/s\fR+\fBw/s\fR) rates are under 0.5 per second. Harmless spikes are fairly normal in such cases.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmpstat\fR utility reports the same \fBwt\fR, \fBusr\fR, and \fBsys\fR statistics. See \fBmpstat\fR(1M) for more information. 
.sp
.LP
When executed in a \fBzone\fR and if the pools facility is active, \fBiostat\fR(1M) will only provide information for those processors in the processor set of the pool to which the \fBzone\fR is bound.
