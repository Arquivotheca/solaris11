.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Point-in-Time Copy software is a point-in-time snapshot feature of the Solaris operating system.
.sp
.LP
A Point-in-Time Copy snapshot is an instantly-available, time-fixed, replicated view of a momentarily quiesced volume. Once a snapshot is taken, Point-in-Time Copy software allows immediate read/write access to both the master and shadow volume data.
.sp
.LP
Point-in-Time Copy software tracks the differences between the master and shadow volumes (caused by writes) from the moment that the snapshot was established. This capability allows applications accessing the master volume's data to move forward in time independently of applications accessing the shadow volume's data, and vice-versa.
.sp
.LP
The Point-in-Time Copy software's tracking of differences between the master and shadow volumes facilitates a fast resynchronization or a full copy at a later time. The volume resynchronization can occur from either shadow to master or master to shadow.
.sp
.LP
Instantly after the point-in-time is (re-)established (either when the CLI prompt returns or the next shell script command is read), the master volume can be remounted or the applications using them can be resumed. Also, the shadow volume can be mounted and immediately accessed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBiiadm\fR command line utility performs only one action per command invocation. Because of this, you cannot combine multiple options, except in combination with the following overall command modifiers:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If no action item is entered, \fBiiadm\fR displays the list of Point-in-Time Copy sets (non-suspended) currently configured. If more than one action item, or an incorrectly specified action item is entered, \fBiiadm\fR displays the specific error message to stderr, followed by a brief usage summary.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For the Point-in-Time Copy options ENABLE (\fB-e\fR), COPY (\fB-c\fR) and UPDATE (\fB-u\fR), there are two associated shadow volume selection qualifiers, \fB{ind|dep}\fR, that are used to specify the type of Point-in-Time Copy volume set to create.
.RE
.sp
.LP
An independent (\fBind\fR) snapshot causes Point-in-Time Copy software to perform a full volume copy operation from the master to the shadow. When the copy completes, the shadow volume data is identical to the master volume data at the moment that it was established. Create an independent shadow if you require two physical copies of the data. An independent shadow volume must be the same size or greater than the size of the master volume. Sun recommends that the master and shadow volumes be the same size for environments where resynchronization from shadow to master is a consideration.
.sp
.LP
A dependent (\fBdep\fR) snapshot causes Point-in-Time Copy software not to perform a full volume copy. The resulting shadow volume relies on the master volume for all unmodified data blocks, which are not copied until requested. Create a dependent shadow when you do not require two physical copies of the data. A dependent shadow volume can be either the same size or smaller than the master volume. A smaller shadow volume is called a \fBCompact Dependent Shadow Volume\fR, and is typically used when the amount of change that occurs to a Point-in-Time Copy volume set is small compared to the entire size of the master volume.
.sp
.LP
The following syntax allows you to create an exportable independent shadow volume in a Sun Cluster environment:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# iiadm -ne ind master shadow bitmap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
An issue arises when using a Compact Dependent Shadow Volume in that its size is established at the time that the Point-in-Time Copy volume set is enabled. If the amount of change to the entire volume set over the duration of its usage exceeds the space allocated for the shadow volume, the shadow volume is marked as out of space. It is possible to read from the shadow volume even after it is out of space, until a portion of the data for which there was no room is requested. Once that happens, the read fails and the shadow volume is marked offline.
.sp
.LP
To address this issue, Point-in-Time Copy supports the ability to associate an \fBoverflow\fR volume to an existing Point-in-Time Copy dependent volume set. Thus, if the size of the Compact Dependent Shadow Volume is too small, or an unscheduled amount of change occurs to the volume set, changed data can be redirected to the associated overflow volume. To facilitate efficient usage of this overflow volume, it can be associated with multiple Point-in-Time Copy volume sets on an as-needed basis.
.SS "Considerations"
.sp
.LP
Prior to invoking an Point-in-Time Copy \fBenable\fR, \fBcopy\fR or \fBupdate\fR operation, Point-in-Time Copy assures that the shadow volume is not mounted, to prevent a file system panic from occurring. Also, it is suggested that you either unmount or suspend (quiesce) all applications using the master volume, for only the instant when the point-in-time snapshot is taken. This assures that an atomically consistent point-in-time snapshot is taken.
.sp
.LP
It is suggested that, if the master volume was suspended rather than unmounted, the new point-in-time shadow volume's integrity be validated using volume validation utilities, such as \fBfsck\fR(1M). The reason is that Point-in-Time Copy has made a point-in-time copy of a \fBmounted\fR master volume to an \fBunmounted\fR shadow volume. During the mounting of the shadow volume, the file system detects that it is in the \fBmounted\fR state. Typically this state occurs only when a system crashes, so the file system attempts to validate the integrity of the volume assuming a system failure occurred, not an Point-in-Time Copy.
.SS "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
.sp
.LP
The \fBii_bitmap\fR variable in the \fB/usr/kernel/drv/ii.conf\fR configuration file determines the bitmap volume operational semantics as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Indicates that the bitmap is maintained in memory only or resume operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Indicates that the bitmap is maintained in memory and on disk. This is the default value.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If a system failure occurrs while using \fBii_bitmap=0\fR, the shadow volume might be inconsistent and fast resynchronization would not be possible.
.sp
.LP
If Point-in-Time Copy is used in conjunction with the Network Storage component Remote Mirror or in a Sun Cluster, set \fBii_bitmap=1\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBii_debug\fR variable in the \fB/usr/kernel/drv/ii.conf\fR configuration file determines the amount of information logging that is output to the system console \fB/dev/console\fR during Point-in-Time Copy processing.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBiiadm\fR utility supports the following options.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fB{ind|dep}\fR \fImaster_vol shadow_vol bitmap_vol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable Point-in-Time Copy for the specified master, shadow, and bitmap volumes.
.sp
The enable shadow set processing assures that the specified volumes are accessible, that the \fIshadow_vol\fR is not mounted, and that the \fIbitmap_vol\fR is correctly sized for the type of shadow set being created. Additionally, it assures that the volumes are under control of the SV driver ( if they are not, it puts them there), initializes the bitmap volume, and, if the volume set is an independent shadow set, a full copy operation is initiated.
.sp
On a successful enable, Point-in-Time Copy stores the specified \fImaster_vol\fR, \fIshadow_vol\fR and \fIbitmap_vol\fR names, plus the enabling type (\fBind\fR or \fBdep\fR), into the Point-in-Time Copy configuration store. The configuration store contains all currently configured Point-in-Time Copy Volume Sets and their associated configuration attributes. (See discussion above on independent and dependent shadow volume semantics.)
.sp
\fImaster_vol\fR is the volume from which a point-in-time snapshot is made.
.sp
\fIshadow_vol\fR is the volume that contains the point-in-time snapshot.
.sp
\fIbitmap_vol\fR is used for tracking differences between the shadow and master volumes. When Point-in-Time Copy shadow operations are suspended or resumed, the bitmap volume (maintained in kernel memory) can be stored in or retrieved from permanent storage. The storage associated with the bitmap volume should be as redundant as that of the shadow volume storage.
.sp
The \fIshadow_vol\fR name is the name that the Point-in-Time Copy Shadow Set is known by for all \fBiiadm\fR options requiring specification of a \fIvolume_set\fR name.

Disable the Point-in-Time Copy volume set associated with the specified \fIvolume_set\fR.
.sp
If Point-in-Time Copy was running in \fBindependent\fR mode as specified in the \fB-e\fR \fBind\fR options, above, the shadow volume data contains the same data as it did before it was disabled (assuming no writes have occurred). Users can access the master and shadow volumes, as they are now standalone point-in-time copies.
.sp
During the time that the full copy is active, an \fBindependent\fR volume operates as though it is a \fBdependent\fR volume. To assure that the volume is no longer in full copy mode, issue the following command to wait for the full copy to complete:
.sp

Update the shadow volume from the master.
.sp
Updates a point-in-time copy of the master volume to the shadow volume. \fIvolume_set\fR is the Point-in-Time Copy shadow set containing the master and shadow volumes. This option provides a fast resynchronization of the shadow volume, creating an incremental copy of the master. This update copies all 32KB segments flagged as different between the master and shadow volumes. It does not copy all master volume data, only changed data. While the data is being copied, the shadow is dependent upon the master volume.
.sp
Before using this option, momentarily quiesce the workload to the volumes; stop the host application from writing to the volumes. This ensures that the point-in-time data is consistent. You can visually check the status of this copy or update operation with \fBiiadm\fR \fB-i\fR \fIvolume_set\fR, or interactively (by means of a shell or script) with \fBiiadm\fR \fB-w\fR \fIvolume_set\fR, before using the target volume for any other operations.
.sp
This command supports PID (Process IDentifier) locking, by using the option \fB-p\fR, \fBiiadm\fR \fB-p\fR \fB-u\fR \fBs\fR. Enabling this option prevents other processes from taking a new point-in-time snapshot, thus invalidating prior point-in-time data.

Remove one or more existing Point-in-Time Copy \fIvolume_set(s)\fR from their currently associated \fIgroup_name\fR.

This Point-in-Time Copy option is a modifier that limits configuration operations to only those volumes belonging to a Sun Cluster Resource Group, or Disk Group.
.sp
In a Sun Cluster where the volume manager is Sun Cluster-aware, \fBiiadm\fR automatically obtains the correct Disk Group information, therefore this option is typically not required unless the volumes are part of an encompassing Resource Group.
.sp
In a Sun Cluster where the volumes are accessible on the local node only, the special \fIcluster_tag\fR of \fBlocal\fR is used to indicate volumes that are not part of a Sun Cluster Resource Group or Disk Group.
.sp
If "\fB-L\fR" is given as a the \fIcluster_tag\fR argument, then \fBiiadm\fR lists all cluster tags associated with Point-in-Time Copy.
.sp
This option is invalid when used on a Solaris system on which the Sun Cluster package has not been installed or configured.

After a volume has failed, Point-in-Time Copy places it offline. After replacing the volume, place it back online using this option. Associated dependent volumes in the Point-in-Time Copy volume set are also placed online. After the volume is placed online, this command also starts any necessary point-in-time volume updates.
