.SH NAME
pppd \- point to point protocol daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpppd\fR [\fItty_name\fR] [\fIspeed\fR] [\fIoptions\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The point-to-point protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point links. PPP is composed of three components: a facility for encapsulating datagrams over serial links, an extensible link control protocol (LCP), and a family of network control protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.
.sp
.LP
The encapsulation scheme is provided by driver code in the kernel. \fBpppd\fR provides the basic LCP authentication support and several NCPs for establishing and configuring the Internet Protocol (referred to as the IP Control Protocol or "IPCP") and IPv6 (IPV6CP).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following sections discuss the \fBpppd\fR options:
.SS "Options Files"
.sp
.LP
Options are taken from files and the command line. \fBpppd\fR reads options from the files \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR, \fB$HOME/.ppprc\fR and \fB/etc/ppp/options.\fR\fIttyname\fR (in that order) before processing the options on the command line. (Command-line options are scanned for the terminal name before the \fBoptions\fR.\fIttyname\fR file is read.) To form the name of the \fBoptions\fR.\fIttyname\fR file, the initial \fB/dev/\fR is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining forward slash characters (/) are replaced with dots. For example, with serial device \fB/dev/cua/a\fR, option file \fB/etc/ppp/options.cua.a\fR is read.
.sp
.LP
An options file is parsed into a series of words that are delimited by whitespace. Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the word in double-quotes ("). A backslash (\e) quotes the succeeding character. A hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the line. There is no restriction on using the \fBfile\fR or \fBcall\fR options within an options file.
.SS "Frequently Used Options"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB<tty_name>\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Communicate over the named device. The string \fB/dev/\fR is prepended if necessary. If no device name is given, or if the name of the terminal connected to the standard input is given, \fBpppd\fR uses that terminal and does not fork to put itself in the background. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB<speed>\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Set the baud rate to <\fBspeed\fR> (a decimal number). The default is to leave the baud rate unchanged. This option is normally needed for dial-out only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBasyncmap\fR \fB\fI<map>\fR\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Set the \fBasync\fR character map to \fI<map>\fR\&. The map describes which control characters cannot be successfully received over the serial line. \fBpppd\fR asks the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte escape sequence. The argument is a 32 bit hex number, with each bit representing a character to escape. Bit 0 (00000001) represents the character 0x00; bit 31 (80000000) represents the character 0x1f or ^_. If multiple \fBasyncmap\fR options are given, the values are \fBORed\fR together. If no \fBasyncmap\fR option is given, \fBpppd\fR attempts to negotiate a value of 0. If the peer agrees, this disables escaping of the standard control characters. Use the \fBdefault-asyncmap\fR option to disable negotiation and escape all control characters.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBauth\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network packets to be sent or received. This option is the default if the system has a default route. If the \fBauth\fR or the \fBnoauth\fR option is not specified, \fBpppd\fR allows the peer to use only those IP addresses to which the system does not already have a route.
.RE

\fB\fBcall\fR \fB\fIname\fR\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Read options from the file \fB/etc/ppp/peers/\fR\fIname\fR. This file may contain privileged options, including \fBnoauth\fR, even if \fBpppd\fR is not being run by root. The \fIname\fR string may not begin with a slash ("/") or include consecutive periods \fB("..")\fR as a pathname component.

Use the executable or shell command specified by \fIscript\fR to set up the serial line. This script would typically use the \fBchat\fR(1M) program to dial the modem and start the remote \fBPPP\fR session. A value for this option originating from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.

\fB\fBcrtscts\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Use hardware flow control, that is, RTS/CTS, to control the flow of data on the serial port. If the \fBcrtscts\fR, \fBnocrtscts\fR, \fBcdtrcts\fR or \fBnocdtrcts\fR option is not provided, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports lack a true RTS output and use this mode to implement unidirectional flow control. The serial port suspends transmission when requested by the modem by means of CTS but cannot request the modem to stop sending to the computer. This mode allows the use of DTR as a modem control line.

Run the executable or shell command specified by \fIscript\fR after \fBpppd\fR terminates the link. Typically, this script is used to command the modem to hang up if hardware modem control signals are not available. \fBdisconnect\fR is not run if the modem has already hung up. A value for this option originating from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.

The characters to be escaped are specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas. Note that almost any character can be specified for the \fBescape\fR option, unlike the \fBasyncmap\fR option which allows only control characters to be specified. Characters that cannot be escaped are those containing hex values 0x20 through 0x3f and 0x5e.

Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either one may be omitted, but the colon is required. The IP addresses are specified with a host name or in decimal dot notation, for example: \fB:10.1.2.3\fR. The default local address is the first IP address of the system unless the \fBnoipdefault\fR option is provided. The remote address is obtained from the peer if not specified in any option. Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required. If a local and/or remote IP address is specified with this option, \fBpppd\fR will not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP negotiation unless the \fBipcp-accept-local\fR and/or \fBipcp-accept-remote\fR options are given, respectively.

Request that the peer compress packets that it sends using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of \fInr\fR bits, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of \fInt\fR bits. If \fInt\fR is not specified, it defaults to the value given for \fInr\fR. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for \fInr\fR and \fInt\fR; larger values provide better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for \fInr\fR or \fInt\fR disables compression in the corresponding direction. Use \fBnobsdcomp\fR or \fBbsdcomp 0\fR to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely. If this option is read from a privileged source, a nonprivileged user may not specify a code size larger than the value from the privileged source.

If \fInt\fR is not specified, it defaults to the value given for \fInr\fR. If \fIe\fR is not specified, it defaults to 6. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for \fInr\fR and \fInt\fR; larger values provide better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. (Value 8 is not permitted due to a zlib bug.) Alternatively, a value of 0 for \fInr\fR or \fInt\fR disables compression in the corresponding direction. Use \fBnodeflate\fR or \fBdeflate 0\fR to disable \fBdeflate\fR compression entirely. (Note: \fBpppd\fR requests deflate compression in preference to BSD-Compress if the peer can do either.)

Initiate the link only on demand, that is, when data traffic is present. With this option, the remote IP address must be specified by the user on the command line or in an options file. \fBpppd\fR initially configures and enables the interface for IP traffic without connecting to the peer. When traffic is available, \fBpppd\fR connects to the peer and performs negotiation, authentication and other actions. When completed, \fBpppd\fR passes data packets across the link. The \fBdemand\fR option implies the \fBpersist\fR option. If this behavior is not desired, use the \fBnopersist\fR option after the \fBdemand\fR option. The \fBidle\fR and \fBholdoff\fR options can be used in conjunction with the \fBdemand\fR option.

The class identifier is one of "null," "local," "IP," "MAC," "magic," "phone," or a decimal integer. If present, the class-dependent value is separated from the identifier by a colon (":") or period (".") . This value may be a standard dotted-decimal IP address for class "IP," an optionally colon-or-dot separated hex Ethernet address for class "MAC" (must have 6 numbers), or an arbitrary string of bytes specified in hex with optional colon or dot separators between bytes.

.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The following sections discuss miscellaneous features of \fBpppd\fR:
.SS "Security"
.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR allows system administrators to provide legitimate users with PPP access to a server machine without fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it runs on. Access control is provided by restricting IP addresses the peer may use based on its authenticated identity (if any), and through restrictions on options a non-privileged user may use. Options that permit potentially insecure configurations are privileged. Privileged options are accepted only in files that are under the control of the system administrator or when \fBpppd\fR is being run by root.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpppd\fR allows an unauthenticated peer to use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a route to that IP address. For example, a system with a permanent connection to the wider Internet will normally have a default route, meaning all peers must authenticate themselves to set up a connection. On such a system, the \fBauth\fR option is the default. Conversely, a system with a PPP link that comprises the only connection to the Internet probably does not possess a default route, so the peer can use virtually any IP address without authenticating itself.
.sp
.LP
Security-sensitive options are privileged and cannot be accessed by a non-privileged user running \fBpppd\fR, either on the command line, in the user's \fB$HOME/.ppprc\fR file, or in an options file read using the \fBfile\fR option. Privileged options may be used in \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR file or in an options file read using the \fBcall\fR option. If \fBpppd\fR is run by the root user, privileged options can be used without restriction. If the \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR file does not exist, then only root may invoke \fBpppd\fR. The \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR file must be created (but may be empty) to allow ordinary non-root users to access \fBpppd\fR.
.sp
.LP
When opening the device, \fBpppd\fR uses the invoking user's user ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending if the device name was specified by the user or the system administrator. If the device name comes from a privileged source, that is, \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR or an options file read using the \fBcall\fR option, \fBpppd\fR uses full root privileges when opening the device. Thus, by creating an appropriate file under \fB/etc/ppp/peers\fR, the system administrator can allow users to establish a PPP connection via a device that they 	would not normally have access to. Otherwise \fBpppd\fR uses the invoking user's real UID when opening the device.
.SS "Authentication"
.sp
.LP
During the authentication process, one peer convinces the other of its identity by sending its name and some secret information to the other. During authentication, the first peer becomes the "client" and the second becomes the "server." Authentication names can (but are not required to) correspond to the peer's Internet hostnames.
.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR supports four authentication protocols: the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and three forms of the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). With the PAP protocol, the client sends its name and a cleartext password to the server to authenticate itself. With CHAP, the server initiates the authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client who must respond with its name and a hash value derived from the shared secret and the challenge.
.sp
.LP
The PPP protocol is symmetrical, meaning that each peer may be required to authenticate itself to the other. Different authentication protocols and names can be used for each exchange.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpppd\fR authenticates if requested and does not require authentication from the peer. However, \fBpppd\fR does not authenticate itself with a specific protocol if it has no secrets that can do so.
.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR stores authentication secrets in the \fB/etc/ppp/pap-secrets\fR (for PAP), and \fB/etc/ppp/chap-secrets\fR (for CHAP) files. Both files use the same format. \fBpppd\fR uses secrets files to authenticate itself to other systems and to authenticate other systems to itself.
.sp
.LP
Secrets files contain one secret per line. Secrets are specific to a particular combination of client and server and can only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that server. Each line in a secrets file has a minimum of three fields that contain the client and server names followed by the secret. Often, these three fields are followed by IP addresses that are used by clients to connect to a server.
.sp
.LP
A secrets file is parsed into words, with client name, server name and secrets fields allocated one word each. Embedded spaces or other special characters within a word must be quoted or escaped. Case is significant in all three fields.
.sp
.LP
A secret beginning with an at sign ("@") is followed by the name of a file containing the secret. An asterisk (*) as the client or server name matches any name. When choosing a match, \fBpppd\fR selects the one with the fewest wildcards. Succeeding words on a line are interpreted by \fBpppd\fR as acceptable IP addresses for that client. IP Addresses are disallowed if they appear in lines that contain only three words or lines whose first word begins with a hyphen ("-"). To allow any address, use "*". An address starting with an exclamation point ("!") indicates that the specified address is not acceptable. An address may be followed by "/" and a number \fIn\fR to indicate a whole subnet (all addresses that have the same value in the most significant \fIn\fR bits). In this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign ("+") to indicate that one address from the subnet is authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use. In this case, the host part of the address is set to the unit number, plus one.
.sp
.LP
When authenticating the peer, \fBpppd\fR chooses a secret with the peer's name in the first field of the secrets file and the name of the local system in the second field. The local system name defaults to the hostname, with the domain name appended if the \fBdomain\fR option is used. The default can be overridden with the \fBname\fR option unless the \fBusehostname\fR option is used.
.sp
.LP
When authenticating to the peer, \fBpppd\fR first determines the name it will use to identify itself to the peer. This name is specified with the \fBuser\fR option. If the \fBuser\fR option is not used, the name defaults to the host name of the local system. \fBpppd\fR then selects a secret from the secrets file by searching for an entry with a local name in the first field and the peer's name in the second field. \fBpppd\fR will know the name of the peer if standard CHAP authentication is used because the peer will have sent it in the Challenge packet. However, if MS-CHAP or PAP is being used, \fBpppd\fR must determine the peer's name from the options specified by the user. The user can specify the peer's name directly with the \fBremotename\fR option. Otherwise, if the remote IP address was specified by a name, rather than in numeric form, that name will be used as the peer's name. If that fails, \fBpppd\fR uses the null string as the peer's name. 
.sp
.LP
When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password	is compared with data in the secrets file. If the password and secret do not match, the password is encrypted using \fBcrypt()\fR and checked against the secret again. If the \fBpapcrypt\fR option is given, the first unencrypted comparison is omitted for better security, and entries must thus be in encrypted \fBcrypt\fR(3C) form.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBlogin\fR option is specified, the username and password are also checked against the system password database. This allows you to set up the \fBpap-secrets\fR file to enable PPP access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses available to users. Typically, when using the \fBlogin\fR option, the secret in \fB/etc/ppp/pap-secrets\fR would be "", which matches any password supplied by the peer. This makes having the same secret in two places unnecessary. When \fBlogin\fR is used, the \fBpam\fR option enables access control through \fBpam\fR(3PAM).
.sp
.LP
Authentication must be completed before IPCP (or other network protocol) can be started. If the peer is required to authenticate itself and fails, \fBpppd\fR closes LCP and terminates the link. If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote host, IPCP is closed. IP packets are sent or received only when IPCP is open.
.sp
.LP
To allow hosts that cannot authenticate themselves to connect 	and use one of a restricted set of IP addresses, add a line to the \fBpap-secrets\fR file specifying the empty string for the client name and secret.
.sp
.LP
Additional \fBpppd\fR options for a given peer may be specified by placing them at the end of the secrets entry, separated by two dashes (--). For example
.sp
.in +2
.nf
peername servername secret ip-address -- novj
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Routing"
.sp
.LP
When IPCP negotiation is complete, \fBpppd\fR informs the kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the PPP interface and creates a host route to the remote end of the link that enables peers to exchange IP packets. Communication with other machines generally requires further modification to routing tables and/or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables. In most cases the \fBdefaultroute\fR and/or \fBproxyarp\fR options are sufficient for this, but further intervention may be necessary. If further intervention is required, use the \fB/etc/ppp/ip-up\fR script or a routing protocol daemon.
.sp
.LP
To add a default route through the remote host, use the \fBdefaultroute\fR option. This option is typically used for "client" systems; that is, end-nodes that use the PPP link for access to the general Internet.
.sp
.LP
In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a server machine connected to a LAN, to allow other hosts to communicate with the remote host. \fBproxyarp\fR instructs \fBpppd\fR to look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host. That is, an interface supporting broadcast and ARP that is not a point-to-point or loopback interface and that is currently up. If found, \fBpppd\fR creates a permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host and the hardware address of the network interface.
.sp
.LP
When the \fBdemand\fR option is used, the interface IP addresses are already set at the time when IPCP comes up. If \fBpppd\fR cannot negotiate the same addresses it used to configure the interface, it changes the interface IP addresses to the negotiated addresses. This may disrupt existing connections. Using demand dialing with peers that perform dynamic IP address assignment is not recommended.
.SS "Scripts"
.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR invokes scripts at various stages during processing that are used to perform site-specific ancillary processing. These scripts may be shell scripts or executable programs. \fBpppd\fR does not wait for the scripts to finish. The scripts are executed as \fBroot\fR (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), enabling them to update routing tables, run privileged daemons, or perform other tasks. Be sure that the contents of these scripts do not compromise your system's security. \fBpppd\fR runs the scripts with standard input, output and error redirected to \fB/dev/null\fR, and with an environment that is empty except for some environment variables that give information about the link. The \fBpppd\fR environment variables are:

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing the \fBauth\fR Option
.sp
.LP
The following examples assume that the \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR file contains the \fBauth\fR option.

.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR is commonly used to dial out to an ISP. You can do this using the "\fBpppd call isp\fR" command where the \fB/etc/ppp/peers/isp\fR file is set up to contain a line similar to the following: 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
cua/a 19200 crtscts connect '/usr/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp' noauth
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For this example, \fBchat\fR(1M) is used to dial the ISP's modem and process any login sequence required. The \fB/etc/ppp/chat-isp\fR file is used by \fBchat\fR and could contain the following:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
ABORT "NO CARRIER" 
ABORT "NO DIALTONE" 
ABORT "ERROR" 
ABORT "NO ANSWER" 
ABORT "BUSY" 
ABORT "Username/Password Incorrect" 
"" "at" 
OK "at&f&d2&c1" 
OK "atdt2468135" 
"name:" "^Umyuserid" 
"word:" "\qmypassword" 
"ispts" "\q^Uppp" 
"~-^Uppp-~"
.fi
.in -2

.LP

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRUsing \fBpppd\fR with \fBproxyarp\fR
.sp
.LP
\fBpppd\fR can also provide a dial-in ppp service for users. If the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run \fBpppd\fR as shown in the following example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBpppd proxyarp\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRProviding a User with Access to PPP Facilities
.sp
.LP
To provide a user with access to the PPP facilities, allocate an IP address for the user's machine, create an entry in \fB/etc/ppp/pap-secrets\fR or \fB/etc/ppp/chap-secrets\fR. This enables the user's machine to authenticate itself. For example, to enable user "Joe" using machine "joespc" to dial in to machine "server" and use the IP address "joespc.my.net," add the following entry to the \fB/etc/ppp/pap-secrets\fR or \fB/etc/ppp/chap-secrets\fR files:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBjoespc	server	"joe's secret"	joespc.my.net\fR 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Alternatively, you can create another username, for example "ppp," whose login shell is \fB/usr/bin/pppd\fR and whose home directory is \fB/etc/ppp\fR. If you run \fBpppd\fR this way, add the options to the \fB/etc/ppp/.ppprc\fR file.

.sp
.LP
If your serial connection is complex, it may be useful to escape such control characters as XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using \fBasyncmap a0000\fR. If the path includes a telnet, escape ^] (\fBasyncmap 200a0000\fR). If the path includes a \fBrlogin\fR command, add \fBescape ff\fR option to the options, because \fBrlogin\fR removes the window-size-change sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the stream.

\fB\fBSIGINT, SIGTERM\fR \fR

Terminate the link, restore the serial device settings and exit.

\fB\fBSIGHUP\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Terminate the link, restore the serial device settings and close the serial device. If the \fBpersist\fR or \fBdemand\fR option is specified, \fBpppd\fR attempts to reopen the serial device and start another connection after the holdoff period. Otherwise \fBpppd\fR exits. If received during the holdoff period, \fBSIGHUP\fR causes \fBpppd\fR to end the holdoff period immediately.

Causes \fBpppd\fR to renegotiate compression. This is useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal decompression error. (Fatal decompression errors generally indicate a bug in an implementation.) 
.RE

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility \fBLOG_DAEMON\fR. To see error and debug messages, edit the \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR file to direct the messages to the desired output device or file, or use the \fBupdetach\fR or \fBlogfile\fR options.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdebug\fR option causes the contents of all LCP, PAP, CHAP or IPCP control packets sent or received to be logged. This is useful if PPP negotiation does not succeed or if authentication fails. 
.sp
.LP
Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a \fBSIGUSR1\fR signal, which acts as a toggle to the \fBpppd\fR process.
