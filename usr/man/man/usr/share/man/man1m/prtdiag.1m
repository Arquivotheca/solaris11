.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBprtdiag\fR displays system configuration and diagnostic information on \fBsun4u\fR, \fBsun4v\fR, and x86 systems.

The interface, output, and location in the directory hierarchy for \fBprtdiag\fR are uncommitted and subject to change in future releases.
.sp

\fBprtdiag\fR does not display diagnostic information and environmental status when executed on the Sun Enterprise 10000 server. See the \fB/var/opt/SUNWssp/adm/${SUNW_HOSTNAME}/messages\fR file on the system service processor (SSP) to obtain such information for this server.
