runacct \- run daily accounting
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fB/usr/lib/acct/runacct\fR [\fImmdd\fR [\fIstate\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrunacct\fR is the main daily accounting shell procedure. It is normally initiated using  \fBcron\fR. \fBrunacct\fR processes connect, fee, disk, and process accounting files. It also prepares summary files for \fBprdaily\fR or billing purposes. \fBrunacct\fR is distributed only to source code licensees.
.sp
.LP
\fBrunacct\fR takes care not to damage active accounting files or summary files in the event of errors. It records its progress by writing descriptive diagnostic messages into \fBactive\fR. When an error is detected, a message is written to \fB/dev/console\fR, mail (see \fBmail\fR(1)) is sent to \fBroot\fR and \fBadm\fR, and \fBrunacct\fR terminates. \fBrunacct\fR uses a series of lock files to protect against re-invocation. The files \fBlock\fR and \fBlock1\fR are used to prevent simultaneous invocation, and \fBlastdate\fR is used to prevent more than one invocation per day.
.sp
.LP
\fBrunacct\fR breaks its processing into separate, restartable \fIstates\fR using \fBstatefile\fR to remember the last \fIstate\fR completed. It accomplishes this by writing the \fIstate\fR name into \fBstatefile\fR. \fBrunacct\fR then looks in \fBstatefile\fR to see what it has done and to determine what to process next. \fIstates\fR are executed in the following order:

Clean up temporary files and exit. To restart \fBrunacct\fR after a failure,  first check the \fBactive\fR file for diagnostics, then fix any corrupted data files, such as \fBpacct\fR or \fBwtmpx\fR. The \fBlock\fR, \fBlock1\fR, and \fBlastdate\fR files must be removed  before \fBrunacct\fR can be restarted. The argument \fImmdd\fR is necessary if \fBrunacct\fR is being restarted. \fImmdd\fR specifies the month and day for which \fBrunacct\fR will rerun the accounting. The entry point for processing is based on the contents of \fB statefile\fR; to override this, include the desired \fIstate\fR on the command line to designate where processing should begin.

It is not recommended to restart \fBrunacct\fR in the \fBSETUP\fR \fIstate\fR. Run \fBSETUP\fR manually and restart using:

If \fBrunacct\fR failed in the \fBPROCESS\fR \fIstate,\fR remove the last \fBptacct\fR file because it will not be complete.

Do not invoke \fBrunacct\fR at the same time as \fBckpacct\fR, as there may be a conflict if both scripts attempt to execute \fBturnacct switch\fR simultaneously.
