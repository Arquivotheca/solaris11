.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipsecconf\fR utility configures the IPsec policy for a host or for one of its tunnels. Once the policy is configured, all outbound and inbound datagrams are subject to policy checks as they exit and enter the host or tunnel. For the host policy, if no entry is found, no policy checks will be completed, and all the traffic will pass through. For a tunnel, if no entry is found and there is at least one entry for the tunnel, the traffic will automatically drop. The difference in behavior is because of the assumptions about IPsec tunnels made in many implementations. Datagrams that are being forwarded will not be subjected to policy checks that are added using this command. See \fBifconfig\fR(1M) and \fBdladm\fR(1M) for information on how to protect forwarded packets. Depending upon the match of the policy entry, a specific action will be taken.
.sp
.LP
This command can be run only by superuser.
.sp
.LP
Each entry can protect traffic in either one direction (requiring a pair of entries) or by a single policy entry which installs the needed symmetric \fBsadb\fR rules.
.sp
.LP
When the command is issued without any arguments, the list of file policy entries loaded are shown. To display the (\fBspd p.e.\fRs) use the \fB-l\fR option. Both will display the index number for the entry. To specify a single tunnel's SPD, use the \fB-i\fR option in combination with \fB-l\fR. To specify all SPDs, both host and for all tunnels, use \fB-L\fR.
.sp
.LP
Note, since one file policy entry (\fBFPE\fR) can generate multiple SPD pol entries (\fBSPE\fRs), the list of FPEs may not show all the actual entries. However, it is still useful in determining what what rules have been added to get the spd into its current state.
.sp
.LP
You can use the \fB-d\fR option with the index to delete a given policy in the system. If the \fB-d\fR option removes an FPE entry that produces multiple SPEs, only then SPD with the same policy index as the FPE will be removed. This can produce a situation where there may be SPEs when there are no FPEs.
.sp
.LP
As with \fB-l\fR, \fB-d\fR can use the \fB-i\fR flag to indicate a tunnel. An alternate syntax is to specify a tunnel name, followed by a comma (\fB,\fR), followed by an index. For example, \fBip.tun0,1\fR.
.sp
.LP
With no options, the entries are displayed in the order that they were added, which is not necessarily the order in which the traffic match takes place.
.sp
.LP
To view the order in which the traffic match will take place, use the \fB-l\fR option. The rules are ordered such that all bypass rules are checked first, then ESP rules, then AH rules. After that, they are checked in the order entered.
.sp
.LP
Policy entries are not preserved across system restarts. Permanent policy entries should be added to \fB/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf\fR. This file is read by the following \fBsmf\fR(5) service:
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
\fBipsecconf\fR supports the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add the IPsec policy to the system as specified by each entry in the file. An IPsec configuration file contains one or more entries that specify the configuration. Once the policy is added, all outbound and inbound datagrams are subject to policy checks.
.sp
Entries in the files are described in the  section below. Examples can be found in the  section below.
.sp
Policy is latched for TCP/UDP sockets on which a \fBconnect\fR(3SOCKET) or \fBaccept\fR(3SOCKET) is issued. So, the addition of new policy entries may not affect such endpoints or sockets. However, the policy will be latched for a socket with an existing non-null policy. Thus, make sure that there are no preexisting connections that will be subject to checks by the new policy entries.
.sp
The feature of policy latching explained above may change in the future. It is not advisable to depend upon this feature.
.sp
The default behavior is to append new rules to the existing policy. If a new rule conflicts with an existing rule, an error is reported, the new rule will not be added.
.sp
To add a new rule that conflicts with an existing rule, the existing rule must be removed (see below) or the existing policy flushed. If the policy is flushed, IPsec will not protect any network traffic until a new policy is added.
.sp
The \fB-F\fR (flush) flag can be combined with \fB-a\fR to perform an atomic policy replacement; the existing policy will be replaced by the new policy described in the config file. By combining these two flags, there is not even a small window when the system is without a policy, which is the case when the flush and add commands are run sequentially.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check the syntax of the configuration file and report any errors without making any changes to the policy. This option is useful when debugging configurations and when \fBsmf\fR(5) reports a configuration error. See \fBSECURITY\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIindex\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Delete the host policy denoted by the index. The index is obtained by invoking \fBipsecconf\fR without any arguments, or with the \fB-l\fR option. See DESCRIPTION for more information. Once the entry is deleted, all outbound and inbound datagrams affected by this policy entry will not be subjected to policy checks. Be advised that with connections for which the policy has been latched, packets will continue to go out with the same policy, even if it has been deleted. It is advisable to use the \fB-l\fR option to find the correct policy index.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIname\fR,\fIindex\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Delete the policy entry denoted by \fIindex\fR on a tunnel denoted by \fIname\fR. Since tunnels affect traffic that might originate off-node, latching does not apply as it does in the host policy case. Equivalent to: \fB-d\fR \fIindex\fR \fB-i\fR \fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Listing of a single policy table, defaulting to the host policy. When \fBipsecconf\fR is invoked without any arguments, a complete list of policy entries with indexes added by the user since boot is displayed. The current table can differ from the previous one if, for example, a multi-homed entry was added or policy reordering occurred, or if a single rule entry generates two \fBspd\fR rules In the case of a multi-homed entry, all the addresses are listed explicitly. If a mask was not specified earlier but was instead inferred from the address, it will be explicitly listed here. This option is used to view policy entries in the correct order. The outbound and inbound policy entries are listed separately.

.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
Each policy entry contains three parts specified as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
{pattern} action {properties}
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
or
.sp
.in +2
.nf
{pattern} action {properties} ["or" action {properties}]*
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Every policy entry begins on a new line and can span multiple lines. If an entry exceeds the length of a line, you should split it only within a "braced" section or immediately before the first (left-hand) brace of a braced section. Avoid using the backslash character (\e). See EXAMPLES.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpattern\fR section, as shown in the syntax above, specifies the traffic pattern that should be matched against the outbound and inbound datagrams. If there is a match, a specific \fIaction\fR determined by the second argument will be taken, depending upon the \fIproperties\fR of the policy entry. 
.sp
.LP
If there is an \fBor\fR in the rule (multiple action-properties for a given pattern), a transmitter will use the first action-property pair that works, while a receiver will use any that are acceptable. 
.sp
.LP
\fIpattern\fR and \fIproperties\fR are name-value pairs where name and value are separated by a <space>, <tab> or <newline>. Multiple name-value pairs should be separated by <space>, <tab> or <newline>. The beginning and end of the pattern and properties are marked by \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR respectively. 
.sp
.LP
Files can contain multiple policy entries. An unspecified name-value pair in the \fIpattern\fR will be considered as a wildcard. Wildcard entries match any corresponding entry in the datagram. 
.sp
.LP
One thing to remember is that UDP port 500 is always bypassed regardless of any policy entries. This is a requirement for \fBin.iked\fR(1M) to work. 
.sp
.LP
File can be commented by using a \fB#\fR as the first character. Comments may be inserted either at the beginning or the end of a line.

.sp
.LP
The standard uses of \fBAH\fR and \fBESP\fR were what drove this ranking of "stronger". There are flaws with this. \fBESP \fR can be used either without authentication, which will allow cut-and-paste or replay attacks, or without encryption, which makes it equivalent or slightly weaker than \fBAH\fR. An administrator should take care to use \fBESP\fR properly. See \fBipsecesp\fR(7P) for more details.

If the new entry has \fBbypass\fR as action, \fBbypass\fR has the highest precedence. It can be added in any order, and the system will still match all the \fBbypass\fR entries before matching any other entries. This is useful for key management daemons which can use this feature to bypass IPsec as it protects its own traffic.

.LP
Entries with both \fBAH\fR (\fBauth_algs\fR present in the policy entry) and \fBESP\fR (\fBencr_auth_algs\fR or \fBencr_auth_algs\fR present in the policy entry) protection are ordered after all the entries with \fBAH\fR and \fBESP\fR and before any \fBAH\fR-only and \fBESP\fR-only entries.

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
If, for example, the policy file comes over the wire from an \fBNFS\fR mounted file system, an adversary can modify the data contained in the file, thus changing the policy configured on the machine to suit his needs. Administrators should be cautious about transmitting a copy of the policy file over a network.
.sp
.LP
To prevent non-privileged users from modifying the security policy, ensure that the configuration file is writable only by trusted users.
.sp
.LP
The configuration file is defined by a property of the \fBpolicy\fR \fBsmf\fR(5) service. The default configuration file, is \fB/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf\fR. This can be changed using the \fBsvcprop\fR(1) command. See \fBNOTES\fR for more details.
.sp
.LP
The policy description language supports the use of tokens that can be resolved by means of a name service, using functions such as \fBgethostbyname\fR(3NSL). While convenient, these functions are only secure as the name service the system is configured to use. Great care should be taken to secure the name service if it is used to resolve elements of the security policy.
.sp
.LP
If your source address is a host that can be looked up over the network and your naming system itself is compromised, then any names used will no longer be trustworthy.
.sp
.LP
If the name switch is configured to use a name service that is not local to the system, bypass policy entries might be required to prevent the policy from preventing communication to the name service. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
Policy is latched for \fBTCP/UDP\fR sockets on which a \fBconnect\fR(3SOCKET) or \fBaccept\fR(3SOCKET) has been issued. Adding new policy entries will not have any effect on them. This feature of latching may change in the future. It is not advisable to depend upon this feature.
.sp
.LP
The \fBipsecconf\fR command can only be run by a user who has sufficient privilege to open the \fBpf_key\fR(7P) socket. The appropriate privilege can be assigned to a user with the Network IPsec Management profile. See \fBprofiles\fR(1), \fBrbac\fR(5), \fBprof_attr\fR(4).

\fBExample 19 \fRUsing AES GMAC
.sp
.LP
The AES GMAC algorithm is a hash algorithm that provides message authentication. An Integrity Check Vector (ICV) is calculated and transmitted as part of the authenticated packet.

.sp
.LP
The AES GMAC algorithm can be used in ESP mode, in which case the packet data and the ESP header are authenticated. When used with IPsec ESP, AES GMAC can only be specified as an encryption algorithm, even though it does not provide any encryption.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsimple example using AES GMAC and 128 bit keys for ESP\fR
\fB{laddr 192.168.99.100 raddr 192.168.99.200} ipsec\fR
    \fB{encr_algs aes-none-gmac(128) sa shared}\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The above example is analogous to the following invalid example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
{laddr 192.168.99.100 raddr 192.168.99.200} ipsec
    {encr_algs null encr_auth_algs aes-gmac(128) sa shared}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When used with ESP, the \fBaes-none-gmac\fR algorithm takes the key length as an optional argument, the supported key lengths can be displayed using the \fBipsecalgs\fR(1M) command.

.sp
.LP
The AES GMAC algorithm can be used in AH mode, in which case the whole packet, including the IP header, is authenticated. When used with IPsec AH, AES GMAC can only be specified as an authentication algorithm.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsimple example using AES GMAC and 128 bit keys for AH\fR
\fB{laddr 192.168.99.100 raddr 192.168.99.200} ipsec\fR
    \fB{auth_algs aes-gmac128 sa shared}\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When used with AH, each key length has its own DOI number, the key length does not need to be specified as an argument.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
IPsec manual keys are managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5). The services listed below manage the components of IPsec. These services are delivered as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/ipsec/policy:default (enabled)
svc:/network/ipsec/ipsecalgs:default (enabled)
svc:/network/ipsec/manual-key:default (disabled)
svc:/network/ipsec/ike:default (disabled)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The manual-key service is delivered disabled. The system administrator must create manual IPsec Security Associations (SAs), as described in \fBipseckey\fR(1M), before enabling that service.
.sp
.LP
The policy service is delivered enabled, but without a configuration file, so that, as a starting condition, packets are not protected by IPsec. After you create the configuration file \fB/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf\fR, as described in this man page, and refresh the service (\fBsvcadm refresh\fR, see below), the policy contained in the configuration file is applied. If there is an error in this file, the service enters maintenance mode.
.sp
.LP
Services that are delivered disabled are delivered that way because the system administrator must create configuration files for those services before enabling them. See \fBike.config\fR(4) for the \fBike\fR service.
.sp
.LP
See \fBipsecalgs\fR(1M) for the \fBipsecalgs\fR service.
.sp
.LP
The correct administrative procedure is to create the configuration file for each service, then enable each service using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
If the configuration needs to be changed, edit the configuration file then refresh the service, as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBsvcadm refresh policy\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fBsmf\fR(5) framework will record any errors in the service-specific log file. Use any of the following commands to examine the \fBlogfile\fR property:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fBsvcs -l policy\fR
example# \fBsvcprop policy\fR
example# \fBsvccfg -s policy listprop\fR

The following property is defined for the \fBpolicy\fR service:
.sp
.in +2
.nf

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

This property can be modified using \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) by users who have been assigned the following authorization:
.sp
.in +2

.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
See \fBauths\fR(1), \fBuser_attr\fR(4), \fBrbac\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The service needs to be refreshed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) before the new property is effective. General non-modifiable properties can be viewed with the \fBsvcprop\fR(1) command.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvccfg -s ipsec/policy setprop config/config_file = /new/config_file\fR
# \fBsvcadm refresh policy\fR

.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, refreshing, and requesting restart can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). A user who has been assigned the authorization shown below can perform these actions:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
solaris.smf.manage.ipsec
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
The \fBipsecconf\fR command is designed to be managed by the \fBpolicy\fR \fBsmf\fR(5) service. While the \fBipsecconf\fR command can be run from the command line, this is discouraged. If the \fBipsecconf\fR command is to be run from the command line, the \fBpolicy\fR \fBsmf\fR(5) service should be disabled first. See \fBsvcadm\fR(1M).
