.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmpstat\fR command reports processor statistics in tabular form. Each row of the table represents the activity of one processor. The first table summarizes all activity since boot. Each subsequent table summarizes activity for the preceding interval. All values are rates listed as events per second unless otherwise noted.
.sp
.LP
During execution of the kernel status command, the \fBstate\fR of the kernel can change. If relevant, a state change message is included in the \fBmpstat\fR output, in one of the following forms:
.sp
.in +2

<<processor 3 moved from pset: -1 to: 1>>
<<pset destroyed: 1>>
<<pset created: 1>>
<<processors added: 1, 3>>
<<processors removed: 1, 3>>

\fB\fBCPU\fR or \fBSET\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n

Without the \fB-a\fR option, \fBmpstat\fR reports \fBCPU\fR statistics for a processor ID. With the \fB-a\fR option, \fBmpstat\fR reports \fBSET\fR statistics for a processor set ID.

\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBmpstat\fR to Generate User and System Operation Statistics
.sp
.LP
The following command generates processor statistics over a five-second interval in two reports. The command shows the processor set membership of each \fBCPU\fR. The default output is sorted by \fBCPU\fR number, aggregated by \fIprocessor set\fR, for user (\fBusr\fR) and system (\fBsys\fR) operations.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The sum of \fBCPU\fR utilization might vary slightly from 100 due to rounding errors in the production of a percentage figure.
.sp
.LP
The total time used for \fBCPU\fR processing is the sum of \fBusr\fR and \fBsys\fR output values, reported for user and system operations. The \fBidl\fR value reports the time that the \fBCPU\fR is idle for any reason other than pending disk I/O operations. 
.sp
.LP
Run the \fBiostat\fR command with the \fB-x\fR option to report I/O service times in \fBsvc_t\fR output. The \fBiostat\fR utility also reports the same \fBwt\fR, user (\fBus\fR), and system (\fBsy\fR) statistics. See \fBiostat\fR(1M) for more information.
.sp
.LP
When executing in a \fBzone\fR and if the pools facility is active, \fBmpstat\fR(1M) will only provide information for those processors which are a member of the processor set of the pool to which the \fBzone\fR is bound.
