.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpcinfo\fR makes an \fBRPC\fR call to an \fBRPC\fR server and reports what it finds.
.sp
.LP
In the first synopsis, \fBrpcinfo\fR lists all the registered \fBRPC\fR services with \fBrpcbind\fR on \fIhost\fR. If \fIhost\fR is not specified, the local host is the default. If \fB-s\fR is used, the information is displayed in a concise format.
.sp
.LP
In the second synopsis, \fBrpcinfo\fR lists all the \fBRPC\fR services registered with \fBrpcbind\fR, version 2. Note that the format of the information is different in the first and the second synopsis. This is because the second synopsis is an older protocol used to collect the information displayed (version 2 of the \fBrpcbind\fR protocol).
.sp
.LP
The third synopsis makes an \fBRPC\fR call to procedure 0 of \fIprognum\fR and \fIversnum\fR on the specified \fIhost\fR and reports whether a response was received. \fItransport\fR is the transport which has to be used for contacting the given service. The remote address of the service is obtained by making a call to the remote \fBrpcbind\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIprognum\fR argument is a number that represents an \fBRPC\fR program number (see \fBrpc\fR(4)).
.sp
.LP
If a \fIversnum\fR is specified, \fBrpcinfo\fR attempts to call that version of the specified \fIprognum\fR. Otherwise, \fBrpcinfo\fR attempts to find all the registered version numbers for the specified \fIprognum\fR by calling version 0, which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, \fBrpcinfo\fR attempts to obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number instead, and attempts to call each registered version. Note that the version number is required for \fB-b\fR and \fB-d\fR options.
.sp
.LP
The \fBEXAMPLES\fR section describe other ways of using \fBrpcinfo\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR\fI transport\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Specify the transport on which the service is required. If this option is not specified, \fBrpcinfo\fR uses the transport specified in the \fBNETPATH\fR environment variable, or if that is unset or \fINULL,\fR the transport in the \fBnetconfig\fR(4) database is used. This is a generic option, and can be used in conjunction with other options as shown in the \fBSYNOPSIS\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIserv_address\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Use \fIserv_address\fR as the (universal) address for the service on \fItransport\fR to \fBping\fR procedure 0 of the specified \fIprognum\fR and report whether a response was received. The \fB-T\fR option is required with the \fB-a\fR option. If \fIversnum\fR is not specified, \fBrpcinfo\fR tries to ping all available version numbers for that program number. This option avoids calls to remote \fBrpcbind\fR to find the address of the service. The \fIserv_address\fR is specified in universal address format of the given transport.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Make an \fBRPC\fR broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified \fIprognum\fR and \fIversnum\fR and report all hosts that respond. If \fItransport\fR is specified, it broadcasts its request only on the specified transport. If broadcasting is not supported by any transport, an error message is printed. Use of broadcasting should be limited because of the potential for adverse effect on other systems.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Delete registration for the \fBRPC\fR service of the specified \fIprognum\fR and \fIversnum\fR. If \fItransport\fR is specified, unregister the service on only that transport, otherwise unregister the service on all the transports on which it was registered. Only the owner of a service can delete a registration, except the superuser, who can delete any service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Display a list of entries with a given \fIprognum\fR and \fIversnum\fR on the specified \fIhost\fR. Entries are returned for all transports in the same protocol family as that used to contact the remote \fBrpcbind\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Display a table of statistics of \fBrpcbind\fR operations on the given \fIhost\fR. The table shows statistics for each version of \fBrpcbind\fR (versions 2, 3 and 4), giving the number of times each procedure was requested and successfully serviced, the number and type of remote call requests that were made, and information about \fBRPC\fR address lookups that were handled. This is useful for monitoring \fBRPC\fR activities on \fIhost\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fI portnum\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Use \fIportnum\fR as the port number for the \fB-t\fR and \fB-u\fR options instead of the port number given by \fBrpcbind\fR. Use of this option avoids a call to the remote \fBrpcbind\fR to find out the address of the service. This option is made obsolete by the \fB-a\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Probe \fBrpcbind\fR on \fIhost\fR using version 2 of the \fBrpcbind\fR protocol, and display a list of all registered \fBRPC\fR programs. If \fIhost\fR is not specified, it defaults to the local host. This option is not useful for IPv6; use \fB-s\fR (see below) instead. Note that version 2 of the \fBrpcbind\fR protocol was previously known as the portmapper protocol.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

Make an \fBRPC\fR call to procedure 0 of \fIprognum\fR on the specified \fIhost\fR using \fBTCP,\fR and report whether a response was received. This option is made obsolete by the \fB-T\fR option as shown in the third synopsis.
