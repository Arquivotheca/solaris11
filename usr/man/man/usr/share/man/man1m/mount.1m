.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmount\fR attaches a file system to the file system hierarchy at the \fImount_point\fR, which is the pathname of a directory. If \fImount_point\fR has any contents prior to the \fBmount\fR operation, these are hidden until the file system is unmounted.
.sp
.LP
\fBumount\fR unmounts a currently mounted file system, which may be specified either as a \fImount_point\fR or as \fIspecial\fR, the device on which the file system resides.
.sp
.LP
The table of currently mounted file systems can be found by examining the mounted file system information file. This is provided by a file system that is usually mounted on \fB/etc/mnttab\fR. The mounted file system information is described in \fBmnttab\fR(4). Mounting a file system adds an entry to the mount table; a \fBumount\fR removes an entry from the table.
.sp
.LP
When invoked with both the \fIspecial\fR and \fImount_point\fR arguments and the \fB-F\fR option, \fBmount\fR validates all arguments except for \fIspecial\fR and invokes the appropriate \fIFSType\fR-specific \fBmount\fR module. If invoked with no arguments, \fBmount\fR lists all the mounted file systems recorded in the mount table, \fB/etc/mnttab\fR. If invoked with a partial argument list (with only one of \fIspecial\fR or \fImount_point\fR, or with both \fIspecial\fR or \fImount_point\fR specified but not \fIFSType\fR), \fBmount\fR will search \fB/etc/vfstab\fR for an entry that will supply the missing arguments. If no entry is found, and the special argument starts with \fB/\fR, the default local file system type specified in \fB/etc/default/fs\fR will be used. Otherwise the default remote file system type will be used. The default remote file system type is determined by the first entry in the \fB/etc/dfs/fstypes\fR file. After filling in missing arguments, \fBmount\fR will invoke the \fIFSType\fR-specific \fBmount\fR module.
.sp
.LP
For file system types that support it, a file can be mounted directly as a file system by specifying the full path to the file as the special argument. In such a case, the \fBnosuid\fR option is enforced. If specific file system support for such loopback file mounts is not present, you can still use \fBlofiadm\fR(1M) to mount a file system image. In this case, no special options are enforced.
.sp
.LP
Only a user with sufficient privilege (at least \fBPRIV_SYS_MOUNT\fR) can mount or unmount file systems using \fBmount\fR and \fBumount\fR. However, any user can use \fBmount\fR to list mounted file systems and resources.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Used to specify the \fIFSType\fR on which to operate. The \fIFSType\fR must be specified or must be determinable from \fB/etc/vfstab\fR, or by consulting \fB/etc/default/fs\fR or \fB/etc/dfs/fstypes\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR [ \fImount_points\fR. . . ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Perform mount or umount operations in parallel, when possible.
.sp
If mount points are not specified, \fBmount\fR will mount all file systems whose \fB/etc/vfstab\fR "mount at boot" field is \fByes\fR. If mount points are specified, then \fB/etc/vfstab\fR "mount at boot" field will be ignored.
.sp
If mount points are specified, \fBumount\fR will only \fBumount\fR those mount points. If none is specified, then \fBumount\fR will attempt to \fBunmount\fR all file systems in \fB/etc/mnttab\fR, with the exception of certain system required file systems: \fB/\fR, \fB/usr\fR, \fB/var\fR, \fB/var/adm\fR, \fB/var/run\fR, \fB/proc\fR, \fB/dev/fd\fR and \fB/tmp\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Forcibly unmount a file system. 
.sp
Without this option, \fBumount\fR does not allow a file system to be unmounted if a file on the file system is busy. Using this option can cause data loss for open files; programs which access files after the file system has been unmounted will get an error (\fBEIO\fR).

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Echo the complete command line, but do not execute the command. \fBumount\fR generates a command line by using the options and arguments provided by the user and adding to them information derived from \fB/etc/mnttab\fR. This option should be used to verify and validate the command line.

\fB\fIgeneric_options\fR\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR

.sp .6

.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-g\fR\fR

.sp .6

Globally mount the file system. On a clustered system, this globally mounts the file system on all nodes of the cluster. On a non-clustered system this has no effect. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify \fIFSType\fR-specific options in a comma separated (without spaces) list of suboptions and keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by the \fIFSType\fR-specific module of the command. (See \fBmount_ufs\fR(1M).) When you use \fB-o\fR with a file system that has an entry in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR, any \fBmount\fR options entered for that file system in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR are ignored.
.sp
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdevices | nodevices\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow the opening of device-special files. The default is \fBdevices\fR.
.sp
If you use \fBnosuid\fR in conjunction with \fBdevices\fR, the behavior is equivalent to that of \fBnosuid\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBexec | noexec\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow executing programs in the file system. Allow or disallow \fBmmap\fR(2) with \fBPROT_EXEC\fR for files within the file system. The default is \fBexec\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBloop\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Ignored for compatibility.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnbmand | nonbmand\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow non-blocking mandatory locking semantics on this file system. Non-blocking mandatory locking is disallowed by default.
.sp
If the file system is mounted with the \fBnbmand\fR option, then applications can use the \fBfcntl\fR(2) interface to place non-blocking mandatory locks on files and the system enforces those semantics. If you enable this option, it can cause standards conformant applications to see unexpected errors. 
.sp
To avoid the possibility of obtaining mandatory locks on system files, do not use the \fBnbmand\fR option with the following file systems:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/
/usr
/etc
/var
/proc
/dev
/devices
/system/contract
/system/object
/etc/mnttab
/etc/dfs/sharetab
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Do not use the \fBremount\fR option to change the \fBnbmand\fR disposition of the file system. The \fBnbmand\fR option is mutually exclusive of the global option. See \fB-g\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBro | rw\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify read-only or read-write. The default is \fBrw\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsetuid | nosetuid\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow \fBsetuid\fR or \fBsetgid\fR execution. The default is \fBsetuid\fR. 
.sp
If you specify \fBsetuid\fR in conjunction with \fBnosuid\fR, the behavior is the same as \fBnosuid\fR. 
.sp
\fBnosuid\fR is equivalent to \fBnosetuid\fR and \fBnodevices\fR. When \fBsuid\fR or \fBnosuid\fR is combined with \fBsetuid\fR or \fBnosetuid\fR and \fBdevices\fR or \fBnodevices\fR, the most restrictive options take effect.
.sp
This option is highly recommended whenever the file system is shared by way of NFS with the \fBroot=\fR option. Without it, NFS clients could add \fBsetuid\fR programs to the server or create devices that could open security holes. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsuid | nosuid\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow \fBsetuid\fR or \fBsetgid\fR execution. The default is \fBsuid\fR. This option also allows or disallows opening any device-special entries that appear within the filesystem.
.sp
\fBnosuid\fR is equivalent to \fBnosetuid\fR and \fBnodevices\fR. When \fBsuid\fR or \fBnosuid\fR is combined with \fBsetuid\fR or \fBnosetuid\fR and \fBdevices\fR or \fBnodevices\fR, the most restrictive options take effect.
.sp
This option is highly recommended whenever the file system is shared using NFS with the \fBroot=\fIoption\fR\fR, because, without it, NFS clients could add \fBsetuid\fR programs to the server, or create devices that could open security holes.

\fB\fBrstchown\fR | \fBnorstchown\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allow or disallow restricted \fBchown\fR. If the file system is mounted with \fBrstchown\fR, the owner of the file is prevented from changing the owner ID  of the file. If the file system is mounted with \fBnorstchown\fR, the user can permit ownership changes for files they own. Only the super-user or a user with appropriate  privilege can arbitrarily change owner IDs.
