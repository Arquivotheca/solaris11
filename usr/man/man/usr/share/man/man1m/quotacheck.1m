.SH NAME
quotacheck \- ufs file system quota consistency checker
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBquotacheck\fR [\fB-fp\fR] [\fB-v\fR] \fIfilesystem\fR...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBquotacheck\fR \fB-a\fR [\fB-fpv\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBquotacheck\fR examines each mounted ufs file system, builds a table of current disk usage, and compares this table against the information stored in the file system's disk quota file. If any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated.
.sp
.LP
\fIfilesystem\fR is either a file system mount point or the block device  on which the file system resides.
.sp
.LP
\fBquotacheck\fR expects each file system to be checked to have a quota file named \fBquotas\fR in the root directory. If none is present, \fBquotacheck\fR will not check the file system.
.sp
.LP
\fBquotacheck\fR accesses the character special device in calculating the actual disk usage for each user. Thus, the file systems that are checked should be quiescent while \fBquotacheck\fR is running.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Check the file systems which \fB/etc/mnttab\fR indicates are ufs file systems.  These file systems must be read-write mounted  with disk quotas enabled, and have an \fBrq\fR entry in the \fBmntopts\fR field in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Force check on file systems with logging enabled. Use in combination with the \fB-p\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Check quotas of file systems in parallel. For file systems with logging enabled, no check is performed unless the \fB-f\fR option is also specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Indicate the calculated disk quotas for each user on a particular file system. \fBquotacheck\fR normally reports only those quotas modified.
