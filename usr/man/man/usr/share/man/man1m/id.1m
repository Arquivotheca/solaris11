.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If no \fIuser\fR operand is provided, the \fBid\fR utility writes the user and group \fBID\fRs and the corresponding user and group names of the invoking process to standard output. If the effective and real \fBID\fRs do not match, both are written. If multiple groups are supported by the underlying system, \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/id\fR also writes the supplementary group affiliations of the invoking process.
.sp
.LP
If a \fIuser\fR operand is provided and the process has the appropriate privileges, the user and group \fBID\fRs of the selected user are written. In this case, effective \fBID\fRs are assumed to be identical to real \fBID\fRs. If the selected user has more than one allowable group membership listed in the group database, \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/id\fR writes them in the same manner as the supplementary groups described in the preceding paragraph. 
.SS "Formats"
.sp
.LP
The following formats are used when the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR locale category specifies the "C" locale. In other locales, the strings \fBuid\fR, \fBgid\fR, \fBeuid\fR, \fBegid\fR, and \fBgroups\fR may be replaced with more appropriate strings corresponding to the locale.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"uid=%u(%s) gid=%u(%s)\en" <\fIreal user ID\fR>, <\fIuser-name\fR>,
    <\fIreal group ID\fR>, <\fIgroup-name\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the effective and real user \fBID\fRs do not match, the following are inserted immediately before the \fB\en\fR character in the previous format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
" euid=%u(%s)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIeffective user ID\fR>, <\fIeffective user-name\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the effective and real group \fBID\fRs do not match, the following is inserted directly before the \fB\en\fR character in the format string (and after any addition resulting from the effective and real user \fBID\fRs not matching):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
" egid=%u(%s)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIeffectivegroup-ID\fR>, <\fIeffectivegroupname\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the process has supplementary group affiliations or the selected user is allowed to belong to multiple groups, the first is added directly before the \fBNEWLINE\fR character in the format string:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
" groups=%u(%s)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIsupplementary group ID\fR>, <\fIsupplementary group name\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and the necessary number of the following added after that for any remaining supplementary group \fBID\fRs:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
",%u(%s)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and the necessary number of the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIsupplementary group ID\fR>, <\fIsupplementary group name\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If any of the user \fBID\fR, group \fBID\fR, effective user \fBID\fR, effective group \fBID\fR or supplementary/multiple group \fBID\fRs cannot be mapped by the system into printable user or group names, the corresponding (\fB%s\fR) and name argument is omitted from the corresponding format string.
.sp
.LP
When any of the options are specified, the output format is as described under OPTIONS.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported by both \fB/usr/bin/id\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/id\fR. The \fB-p\fR and \fB-a\fR options are invalid if specified with any of the \fB-G\fR, \fB-g\fR, or \fB-u\fR options. 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR

.RS 6n
.rt  
Reports additionally the current project membership of the invoking process. The project is reported using the            format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"projid=%u(%s)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

which is inserted prior to the \fB\n\fR character of the default format described in the \fBFormats\fR section. The arguments
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<\fIproject ID\fR>,<\fIproject name\fR>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

are appended to the end of the argument list.  If the project \fBID\fR cannot be mapped by the system into a printable project name, the corresponding \fB(%s)\fR and name argument is omitted from the corresponding format string.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Output produced by the \fB-G\fR option and by the default case could potentially produce very long lines on systems that support large numbers of supplementary groups.
