.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBnfsstat\fR displays statistical information about the \fBNFS\fR and \fBRPC\fR (Remote Procedure Call), interfaces to the kernel. It can also be used to reinitialize this information. If no options are given the default is as follows:
.sp
.LP
\fBnfsstat\fR \fB-csnra\fR
.sp
.LP
The default displays everything, but reinitializes nothing.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display \fBNFS_ACL\fR information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display client information. Only the client side \fBNFS\fR, \fBRPC\fR, and \fBNFS_ACL\fR information is printed. Can be combined with the \fB-n\fR, \fB-r\fR, and \fB-a\fR options to print client side \fBNFS\fR, \fBRPC\fR, and \fBNFS_ACL\fR information only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR [\fIpathname...\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display statistics for each \fBNFS\fR mounted file system. If \fIpathname\fR is not specified, displays statistics for all NFS mounted file systems. If \fIpathname\fR is specified, displays statistics for the NFS mounted file systems indicated by \fIpathname\fR.
.sp
This includes the server name and address, mount flags, current read and write sizes, the retransmission count, the attribute cache timeout values, failover information, and the timers used for dynamic retransmission. The dynamic retransmission timers are displayed only where dynamic retransmission is in use. By default, \fBNFS\fR mounts over the \fBTCP\fR protocols and \fBNFS\fR Version 3 mounts over either \fBTCP\fR or \fBUDP\fR do not use dynamic retransmission.
.sp
If you specify the \fB-m\fR option, this is the only option that \fBnfsstat\fR uses. If you specify other options with \fB-m\fR, you receive an error message alerting that the \fB-m\fR flag cannot be combined with other options.
