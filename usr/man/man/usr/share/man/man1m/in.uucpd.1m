.SH NAME
in.uucpd, uucpd \- UUCP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.uucpd\fR [\fB-n\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR is the server for supporting \fBUUCP\fR connections over networks.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR is invoked by \fBinetd\fR(1M) when a \fBUUCP\fR connection is established, that is, a connection to the port indicated in the "uucp" service specification, and executes the following protocol. See \fBservices\fR(4):
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The server prompts with \fBlogin:\fR. The \fBuucico\fR(1M) process at the other end must supply a username.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Unless the username refers to an account without a password, the server then prompts with \fBPassword:\fR. The \fBuucico\fR process at the other end must supply the password for that account.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If the username is not valid, or is valid but refers to an account that does not have \fB/usr/lib/uucp/uucico\fR as its login shell, or if the password is not the correct password for that account, the connection is dropped.  Otherwise, \fBuucico\fR is run, with the user \fBID\fR, group \fBID\fR, group set, and home directory for that account, with the environment variables \fBUSER\fR and \fBLOGNAME\fR set to the specified username, and with a \fB-u\fR flag specifying the username. Unless the \fB-n\fR flag is specified, entries are made in \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR, \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, and \fB/var/adm/lastlog\fR for the username. \fBin.uucpd\fR must be invoked by a user with appropriate privilege (usually root) in order to be able to verify that the password is correct.
.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management, and session management.  The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBin.uucpd\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for \fBuucp\fR using the UNIX authentication, account management, and session management module.

If there are no entries for the \fBuucp\fR service, then the entries for the "other" service will be used. If multiple authentication modules are listed, then the peer may be prompted for multiple passwords.
