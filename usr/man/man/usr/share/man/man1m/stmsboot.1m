stmsboot \- administration program for the Solaris I/O multipathing feature
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/stmsboot\fR [[\fB-D\fR (fp | mpt | mpt_sas | iscsi) ] \fB-d\fR | \fB-e\fR | \fB-u\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Solaris I/O multipathing feature is a multipathing solution for storage devices that is part of the Solaris operating environment. This feature was formerly known as Sun StorEdge Traffic Manager (STMS) or MPxIO.
.sp
.LP
The \fBstmsboot\fR program is an administrative command to manage enumeration of multipath-capable devices with Solaris I/O multipathing. Solaris I/O multipathing-enabled devices are enumerated under \fBscsi_vhci\fR(7D), providing multipathing capabilities. Solaris I/O multipathing-disabled devices are enumerated under the physical controller.
.sp
.LP
In the \fB/dev\fR and \fB/devices\fR trees, Solaris I/O multipathing-enabled devices receive new names that indicate that they are under Solaris I/O multipathing control. This means a device will have a different name from its original name (after enabling) when it is under Solaris I/O multipathing control. The \fBstmsboot\fR command automatically updates \fB/etc/vfstab\fR and dump configuration to reflect the device names changes when enabling or disabling Solaris I/O multipathing. One reboot is required for changes to take effect.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

Enables Solaris I/O multipathing on all supported multipath-capable controller ports, including \fBfp\fR(7D), \fBmpt\fR(7D), \fBmpt_sas\fR(7D), and \fBiscsi\fR(7D) port drivers. Multipath-capable ports include fibre channel (\fBfp\fR(7D)) controller ports and SAS (\fBmpt\fR(7D) or \fBmpt_sas\fR(7D)) controller ports. Following this enabling, you are prompted to reboot. During the reboot, \fBvfstab\fR and the dump configuration will be updated to reflect the device name changes. Specifying \fB-D\fR \fBmpt\fR, \fB-D\fR \fBmpt_sas\fR, or \fB-D\fR \fBfp\fR limits the enabling operation to ports attached using the specified driver.

.RE

.sp
.LP
Note that \fBmpt_sas\fR(7D) has MPxIO turned on by default. This means that when using the \fB-L\fR or \fB-l\fR option with \fB-D\fR \fBmpt_sas\fR, \fBstmsboot\fR does not display any non-multipathed and multipathed device names.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The primary function of \fBstmsboot\fR is to control the enabling and disabling of Solaris I/O multipathing on the host. The utility automatically updates \fBvfstab\fR(4) and \fBdumpadm\fR(1M) configuration to reflect device name changes. The system administrator is responsible for modifying application configuration (for example, backup software, DBMS, and so forth) to reflect updated device names.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-L\fR and \fB-l\fR options display the mapping between multipathed and non-multipathed device names. These options function only after changes to the Solaris I/O multipathing configuration have taken effect, that is, following the reboot after invoking \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-e\fR.
.sp
.LP
ZFS datasets, including ZFS root datasets, are correctly handled by \fBstmsboot\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Solaris I/O multipathing is not supported on all devices. After enabling Solaris I/O multipathing, only supported devices are placed under Solaris I/O multipathing control. Non-supported devices remain unchanged.
.sp
.LP
For Solaris releases prior to the current release, the \fB-e\fR and \fB-d\fR options replace \fBmpxio-disable\fR property entries with a global \fBmpxio-disable\fR entry in \fBfp.conf\fR.
.SS "Enabling Solaris I/O Multipathing on a Sun StorEdge Disk Array"
.sp
.LP
The following applies to Sun StoreEdge T3, 3910, 3960, 6120, and 6320 storage subsystems.
.sp
.LP
To place your Sun StorEdge disk subsystem under Solaris I/O multipathing control, in addition to enabling Solaris I/O multipathing, the \fBmp_support\fR of the subsystem must be set to \fBmpxio\fR mode. The preferred sequence is to change the subsystem's \fBmp_support\fR to \fBmpxio\fR mode, then run \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-e\fR. If Solaris I/O multipathing is already enabled but the subsystem's \fBmp_support\fR is not in \fBmpxio\fR mode, then change the \fBmp_support\fR to \fBmpxio\fR mode and run \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-u\fR.
.sp
.LP
Refer to the \fISun StorEdge Administrator's Guide\fR for your subsystem for more details.
.SS "Using \fBufsdump\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBufsdump\fR(1M) command records details of filesystem dumps in \fB/etc/dumpdates\fR (see \fBdumpdates\fR(4)). Among other items, the entries contain device names. An effect of the "active" \fBstmsboot\fR options (\fB-e\fR, \fB-d\fR, and \fB-u\fR) is to change the device name of a storage device.
.sp
.LP
Because \fBstmsboot\fR does not modify \fBdumpdates\fR, entries will refer to obsolete device names, that is, device names that were in effect before Solaris I/O multipathing configuration changes were performed. In this situation \fBufsdump\fR will behave as if no previous dump of the filesystem had been performed. A level 0 dump will be performed.
.SS "Procedure to Use \fBstmsboot\fR in Conjunction with Sun Cluster"
.sp
.LP
If possible, invoke \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-e\fR before installing Sun Cluster software. After executing \fBstmsboot\fR, install Sun Cluster software normally.
.sp
.LP
If Sun Cluster software is installed before executing \fBstmsboot\fR, follow this procedure:
.sp
.LP
On each machine in the cluster where Solaris I/O multipathing is required, execute:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBstmsboot -e\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...and allow the system to reboot.
.sp
.LP
When the system comes up, enter the following two commands:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
# \fB/usr/cluster/bin/scdidadm -C\fR
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
# \fB/usr/cluster/bin/scdidadm -r\fR
.sp
The preceding commands update \fBdid\fR mappings with new device names while preserving \fBdid\fR instance numbers for disks that are connected to multiple cluster nodes. \fBdid\fR instance numbers of the local disks might not be preserved. For this reason, the \fBdid\fR disk names for local disks might change.
.sp
The remaining steps are required only if local \fBdid\fR number  changes require editing of \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. If such editing is not required, run \fB/usr/cluster/bin/scgdevs\fR from each node in the cluster to complete the procedure.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP

Update \fB/etc/vfstab\fR to reflect any new \fBdid\fR disk names for your local disks.

.LP
To disable the Solaris multipathing feature, use \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-d\fR (instead of \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-e\fR), then follow the procedure above.
.sp
.LP
To view mappings between the old and new device names, run \fBstmsboot\fR \fB-L\fR. To view \fBdid\fR device name mappings, run \fB/usr/cluster/bin/scdidadm\fR \fB-L\fR.
.sp
.LP
With active-passive storage arrays, it is possible that while your host is rebooting the array controller could failover the path that a particular target is using. In this scenario, \fBfsck\fR(1M) will fail to open the physical path listed in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. The \fBsvc:/system/filesystem/local:default\fR SMF service will transition to a maintenance state as a result. To rectify this, consult the documentation for your storage array to failback the path. The \fBmpathadm\fR(1M) can assist with determining the active and passive path(s).
.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
.LP
On x86 platforms, the current Solaris release does not support disabling Solaris I/O multipathing of boot devices attached by means of fibre channel. Solaris I/O multipathing is always enabled for supported fibre channel-attached boot devices. Disabling Solaris I/O multipathing in this situation must be performed on a per-port basis. See \fBfp\fR(7D).
.sp
.LP
Executing \fBdevfsadm\fR \fB-C\fR removes obsolete device entries that \fBstmsboot\fR relies on. This will prevent correct operation of the \fB-d\fR option for boot devices (regardless of platform type) and the \fB-L\fR option.
