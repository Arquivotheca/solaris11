.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Secure Digital (SD) and MultiMediaCard (MMC) hardware specific library, \fB/usr/lib/cfgadm/sdcard.so.1\fR, provides the functionality for SD/MMC hot-plugging through the \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) command. The \fBcfgadm\fR command operates on attachment  points, which are locations in the system where hardware resources can be dynamically reconfigured.  See  \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) for information on attachment points.
.sp
.LP
Each SD/MMC slot is represented by an attachment point in the device tree. Card devices that are connected and configured in the system are shown as attachment point name extensions. The terms "attachment point" and "SD/MMC slot" are used interchangeably throughout this manpage.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points are named through  ap_ids. All SD/MMC attachment points consist of a string in the following form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sdcardX/[S][::dsk/cXtYd0]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Where: 
.sp
.LP
\fIX\fR is the SD/MMC controller number.
.sp
.LP
\fIS\fR is the slot number on the controller (0 to 8).
.sp
.LP
\fBdev/cXtYd0\fR identifies the inserted memory card.
.sp
.LP
\fIY\fR is a target number.
.sp
.LP
In general,  the device identifier is derived from the corresponding logical  link for the device in \fB/dev\fR. Because only one LUN (LUN 0) is supported by the SD/MMC device, the "d" component of the device string will always have number 0 (zero). For example, the logical \fIap_id\fR of slot 4 of SD/MMC controller 2 would be \fBsdcard2/4\fR. If the SD/MMC media card is inserted in this attachment point and the device is configured, the \fBap_id\fR might be \fBsdcard2/4::dsk/c2t0d0\fR.
.sp
.LP
The  c\fIX\fRt\fIY\fRd\fI0\fR string identifying a device has one-to-one correspondence to the device attachment point.
.sp
.LP
A simple listing of attachment points in the system includes all SD/MMC device slots and attached devices. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#cfgadm -l
Ap_Id                    Type       Receptacle   Occupant    Condition

 sata0/1::dev/c0t1d0     disk        connected    configured     ok
 sata0/2::dev/c0t2d0     cd-dvd      connected    configured     ok
 sata0/3                 sata-port   empty        unconfigured   ok
 usb0/1                  unknown     empty        unconfigured   ok
 usb0/2                  unknown     empty        unconfigured   ok

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgadm\fR command defines several types of operations besides  listing (\fB-l\fR). These operations include invoking configuration state changes (\fB-c\fR), invoking  hardware specific functions (\fB-x\fR),  and obtaining configuration administration help messages (\fB-h\fR).
.sp
.LP
\fB-c\fR: For SD/MMC slot attachment points, the following configuration state change operations are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconnect\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable (activate) the SD/MMC slot and establish  the communication with an attached device. This operation implies powering-on the slot if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdisconnect\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unconfigure the inserted  device if it is not already  unconfigured and disable (deactivate) the SD/MMC slot. A subsequent "connect" command enables SD/MMC slot operation but does not bring a device to the "configured" state.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following state change operations are supported for an SD/MMC card inserted in to the SD/MMC slot:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconfigure\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Configure new device for use by the operating system  if  it  is not already configured.  This command  also  implies connect operation, if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBunconfigure\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unconfigure the device inserted in the SD/MMC slot if it is not already unconfigured.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fB-f \fR: Not supported.
.sp
.LP
\fB-h\fR \fBap_id\fR: SD/MMC specific help can be obtained  by using the  help option with any SD/MMC attachment point. 
.sp
.LP
\fB-l\fR [-v]: The -l option works as  described  in  \fBcfgadm\fR(1M).  When paired  with the -v option, the "Information" field contains the following SD/MMC-specific information:
.br
.in +2
Mod: product model string
.in -2
.br
.in +2
Rev: product revision number (major.minor)
.in -2
.br
.in +2
Date: month and year of manufacture
.in -2
.br
.in +2
SN: product serial number (hexadecimal)
.in -2
.sp
.LP
\fB-o\fR hardware_options \(em No hardware specific options are currently defined.
.sp
.LP
\fB-s\fR listing_options: Attachment points of class SD/MMC can be listed  by  using the select suboption. See \fBcfgadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
\fB-t\fR \fBap_id\fR: Self-test functionality. Not supported by SD/MMC slots.
.sp
.LP
\fB-x\fR \fBhardware_function\fR: Perform hardware specific function. sdcard_reset_slot \fBap_id\fRindicates reset of the SD/MMC slot specified by \fBap_id\fR.  If an SD/MMC device is inserted in the slot, it is also reset.
.sp
.LP
\fB-v\fR: Execute in verbose mode.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
Example 1 - Configuring an SD/MMC card:
.sp
.LP
The following command configures a card attached to SD/MMC controller 0, slot 0. It should be issued only when there is a device inserted in the SD/MMC slot.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
       # cfgadm -c configure sdcard0/0
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Example 2 - Unconfiguring an SD/MMC card:
.sp
.LP
The following command unconfigures a card inserted in SD/MMC controller 0, slot 3:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
       # cfgadm -c unconfigure sdcard0/3
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Example 3 \(em Encountering a mounted file system while unconfiguring a disk:
.sp
.LP
The following command illustrates encountering a mounted file system while unconfiguring a disk:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
       # cfgadm -c unconfigure sdcard1/5::dsk/c01t35d0

 
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The system responds with the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
 cfgadm: Component system is busy, try again: failed to offline:
       /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,244e@1e/pci1095,3124@1/sd@5,0

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Under normal operation, SD/MMC media cards are automatically configured when a card is inserted. Most administrators do not find it necessary to use this command under normal use.
.sp
.LP
Removing an SD/MMC card without first unconfiguring it may result in data loss if the device is being written to when it's being removed. Devices that are mounted read-only can be safely removed at any time.
.sp
.LP
Devices that have filesystems other than \fBpcfs\fR(7FS) on them should always be explicitly unconfigured before removal.
