.SH NAME
rpc.rexd, rexd \- RPC-based remote execution server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/rpc.rexd\fR [\fB-s\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.rexd\fR is the Sun \fBRPC\fR server for remote program execution. This daemon is started by \fBinetd\fR(1M) whenever a remote execution request is made.
.sp
.LP
For non-interactive programs, the standard file descriptors are connected directly to \fBTCP\fR connections. Interactive programs involve pseudo-terminals, in a fashion that is similar to the login sessions provided by \fBrlogin\fR(1). This daemon may use \fBNFS\fR to mount file systems specified in the remote execution request.
.sp
.LP
There is a \fB10240\fR byte limit for arguments to be encoded and passed from the sending to the receiving system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following option is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Secure. When specified, requests must have valid \fBDES\fR credentials. If the request does not have a \fBDES\fR credential it is rejected. The default publickey credential is rejected. Only newer \fBon\fR(1) commands send \fBDES\fR credentials.
.sp
If access is denied with an authentication error, you may have to set your publickey with the \fBchkey\fR(1) command.
.sp
Specifying the \fB-s\fR option without presenting secure credentials will result in an error message: \fBUnix too weak auth (DesONly)!\fR

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.rexd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for account and session management.  The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBrpc.rexd\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with \fBrpc.rexd\fR entries for account and session management using the UNIX module.

If there are no entries for the \fBrpc.rexd\fR service, the entries for the "other" service will be used. \fBrpc.rexd\fR uses the \fBgetpwuid()\fR call to determine whether the given user is a legal user.
