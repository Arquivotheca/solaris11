.SH NAME
captoinfo \- convert a termcap description into a terminfo description
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcaptoinfo\fR [\fB-1\fR] [\fB-v\fR]... [\fB-V\fR] [\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBcaptoinfo\fR looks in \fIfilename\fR for  \fBtermcap\fR descriptions. For each one found, an equivalent  \fBterminfo\fR description is written to standard output, along with any comments found. A description which is expressed as relative to another description (as specified in the \fBtermcap\fR \fBtc = field\fR) is reduced to the minimum superset before being displayed.
.sp
.LP
If no  \fIfilename\fR is given, then the environment variable \fB\fR\fBTERM\fR\fBCAP \fR is used for the filename or entry. If \fB\fR\fBTERM\fR\fBCAP \fR is a full pathname to a file,  only the terminal whose name is specified in the environment variable \fBTERM\fR is extracted from that file. If the environment variable \fB\fR\fBTERM\fR\fBCAP \fR is not set, then the file \fB/usr/share/lib/termcap\fR is read.
