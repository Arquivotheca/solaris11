.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipfstat\fR command is part of a suite of commands associated with the Solaris IP Filter feature. See \fBipfilter\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The \fBipfstat\fR command examines \fB/dev/kmem\fR using the symbols \fB_fr_flags\fR, \fB_frstats\fR, \fB_filterin\fR, and \fB_filterout\fR. To run and work, it needs to be able to read both \fB/dev/kmem\fR and the kernel itself.
.sp
.LP
The default behavior of \fBipfstat\fR is to retrieve and display the statistics which have been accumulated over time as the kernel has put packets through the filter.
.sp
.LP
The role of \fBipfstat\fR is to display current kernel statistics gathered as a result of applying the filters in place (if any) to packets going in and out of the kernel. This is the default operation when no command line parameters are present. When supplied with either \fB-i\fR or \fB-o\fR, \fBipfstat\fR will retrieve and display the appropriate list of filter rules currently installed and in use by the kernel.
.sp
.LP
\fBipfstat\fR uses kernel device files to obtain information. The default permissions of these files require \fBipfstat\fR to be run as root for all operations.
.sp
.LP
The \fBipfstat\fR command supports the \fBkstat\fR(3KSTAT) kernel facility. Because of this support, as an alternative to \fBipfstat\fR, you can use \fBkstat\fR(1M). For example:
.sp
.LP
# kstat \(hym ipf
.sp
.LP
Using the \fBipfstat\fR \fB-t\fR option causes \fBipfstat\fR to enter the state top mode. In this mode the state table is displayed similarly to the way the Unix \fBtop\fR utility displays the process table. The \fB-C\fR, \fB-D\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-S\fR and \fB-T\fR command line options can be used to restrict the state entries that will be shown and to specify the frequency of display updates.
.sp
.LP
In state top mode, use the following keys to influence the displayed information:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Reverse the sorting criteria.
.RE

.sp
.LP
States can be sorted by protocol number, by number of IP packets, by number of bytes, and by time-to-live of the state entry. The default is to sort by the number of bytes. States are sorted in descending order, but you can use the \fBr\fR key to sort them in ascending order.
.sp
.LP
It is not possible to interactively change the source, destination, and protocol filters or the refresh frequency. This must be done from the command line.
.sp
.LP
The screen must have at least 80 columns for correct display. However, \fBipfstat\fR does not check the screen width.
.sp
.LP
Only the first \fIX\fR-5 entries that match the sort and filter criteria are displayed (where \fIX\fR is the number of rows on the display). There is no way to see additional entries.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Valid only in combination with \fB-t\fR. Display "closed" states as well in the top. Normally, a TCP connection is not displayed when it reaches the \fBCLOSE_WAIT\fR protocol state. With this option enabled, all state entries are displayed.

.rt  
Valid only in combination with \fB-t\fR. Limit the state top display to show only state entries whose destination IP address and port match the \fIaddrport\fR argument. The \fIaddrport\fR specification is of the form \fIipaddress\fR[,\fIport\fR]. The \fIipaddress\fR and \fIport\fR should be either numerical or the string \fBany\fR (specifying any IP address and any port, in that order). If the \fB-D\fR option is not specified, it defaults to \fB-D\fR \fBany,any\fR.
