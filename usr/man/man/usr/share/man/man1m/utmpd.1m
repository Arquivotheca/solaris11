.SH NAME
utmpd \- utmpx monitoring daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fButmpd\fR [\fB-debug\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fButmpd\fR daemon monitors the \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR file. See \fButmpx\fR(4) (and \fButmp\fR(4) for historical information).
.sp
.LP
\fButmpd\fR receives requests from \fBpututxline\fR(3C) by way of a named pipe. It maintains a table of processes and uses \fBpoll\fR(2) on \fB/proc\fR files to detect process termination. When \fButmpd\fR detects that a process has terminated, it checks that the process has removed its \fButmpx\fR entry from \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR. If the process' \fButmpx\fR entry has not been removed, \fButmpd\fR removes the entry. By periodically scanning the \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR file, \fButmpd\fR also monitors processes that are not in its table.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If the filesystem holding \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR is mounted with options which inhibit or defer access time updates, an unknown amount of error will be introduced into the \fButmp\fR \fBDOWN_TIME\fR record's timestamp in the event of an uncontrolled shutdown (for example, a crash or loss of power ). Controlled shutdowns will update the modify time of \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, which will be used on the next boot to determine when the previous shutdown ocurred, regardless of access time deferral or inhibition.
.sp
.LP
The \fButmpd\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/utmp:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
