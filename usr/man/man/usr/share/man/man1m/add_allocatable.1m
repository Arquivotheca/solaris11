.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBadd_allocatable\fR creates new entries for user allocatable devices that are to be managed by the device allocation mechanism. \fBadd_allocatable\fR can also be used to update existing entries of such devices.
.sp
.LP
\fBadd_allocatable\fR can also create and update entries for non-allocatable devices, such as printers, whose label range is managed by the device allocation mechanism.
.sp
.LP
\fBadd_allocatable\fR can be used in shell scripts, such as installation scripts for driver packages, to automate the administrative work of setting up a new device.
.sp
.LP
Use \fBlist_devices\fR(1) to see the names and types of allocatable devices, their attributes, and device paths.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Force an update of an already-existing entry with the specified information. \fBadd_allocatable\fR exits with an error if this option is not specified when an entry with the specified device name already exists.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RS 20n
.rt  
If this option is present, \fBadd_allocatable\fR updates the system-supplied default attributes of the device type specified with \fB-t\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR\fR

Adds or updates an entry for device that is specified by \fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItype\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIdevice-list\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Adds or updates device paths to the device that is specified with \fB-n\fR. Multiple paths in \fIdevice-list\fR must be separated by white spaces and the list must be quoted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIauthorization\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Adds or updates the authorization that is associated with either the device that is specified with \fB-n\fR or with devices of the type that is specified with \fB-t\fR. When more than one authorization is specified, the list must be separated by commas and must be quoted. When the device is not allocatable, \fIauthorization\fR is specified with an asterisk (*) and must be quoted. When the device is allocatable by any user, \fIauthorization\fR is specified with the at sign (@) and must be quoted. Default authorization is '@'.

\fB\fB-c\fR \fIclean\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies the \fBdevice_clean\fR(5) program \fIclean\fR to be used with the device that is specified with \fB-n\fR or with devices of the type that is specified with \fB-t\fR. The default clean program is \fB/bin/true\fR.

\fB\fBclass\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Specifies a logical  grouping of devices. For example, all Sun Ray\u\s-2TM\s+2\d devices of all device types is a logical grouping. The \fBclass\fR keyword has no default value.
