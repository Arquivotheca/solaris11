.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The command \fBifconfig\fR is used to assign an address to a network interface and to configure network interface parameters. Network interfaces configured by the \fBifconfig\fR command do not survive a reboot. The \fBipadm\fR(1M) command must be used to configure network interfaces persistently. If no option is specified, \fBifconfig\fR displays the current configuration for a network interface. If an address family is specified, \fBifconfig\fR reports only the details specific to that address family. Only privileged users may modify the configuration of a network interface. Options appearing within braces (\fB{\|}\fR) indicate that one of the options must be specified.
.SS "DHCP Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The forms of \fBifconfig\fR that use the \fBauto-dhcp\fR or \fBdhcp\fR arguments are used to control the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ("\fBDHCP\fR") configuration of the interface. In this mode, \fBifconfig\fR is used to control operation of \fBdhcpagent\fR(1M), the \fBDHCP\fR client daemon. Once an interface is placed under \fBDHCP\fR control by using the \fBstart\fR operand, \fBifconfig\fR should not, in normal operation, be used to modify the address or characteristics of the interface. If the address of an interface under \fBDHCP\fR is changed, \fBdhcpagent\fR will remove the interface from its control.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Make the interface available to every shared-IP zone on the system. The appropriate zone to which to deliver data is determined using the \fBtnzonecfg\fR database. This option is available only if the system is configured with the Solaris Trusted Extensions feature.
.sp
The \fBtnzonecfg\fR database is described in the \fBtnzonecfg(4)\fR man page, which is part of the \fISolaris Trusted Extensions Reference Manual\fR.

.na
\fB\fBarp\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol ("\fBARP\fR") in mapping between network level addresses and link level addresses (default). This is currently implemented for mapping between IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-arp\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable the use of the \fBARP\fR on a physical interface. ARP cannot be disabled on an IPMP IP interface.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBauth_algs\fR \fIauthentication algorithm\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
For a tunnel, enable IPsec \fBAH\fR with the authentication algorithm specified. The algorithm can be either a number or an algorithm name, including \fIany\fR to express no preference in algorithm. All IPsec tunnel properties must be specified on the same command line. To disable tunnel security, specify an \fBauth_alg\fR of \fBnone\fR.
.sp
It is now preferable to use the \fBipsecconf\fR(1M) command when configuring a tunnel's security properties. If \fBipsecconf\fR was used to set a tunnel's security properties, this keyword will not affect the tunnel.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBauto-dhcp\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use DHCP to automatically acquire an address for this interface. This option has a completely equivalent alias called \fBdhcp\fR. 
.sp
For IPv6, the interface specified must be the zeroth logical interface (the physical interface name), which has the link-local address.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBprimary\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Defines the interface as the \fBprimary\fR. The interface is defined as the preferred one for the delivery of client-wide configuration data. Only one interface can be the primary at any given time. If another interface is subsequently selected as the primary, it replaces the previous one. Nominating an interface as the primary one will not have much significance once the client work station has booted, as many applications will already have started and been configured with data read from the previous primary interface.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBwait \fIseconds\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBifconfig\fR command will wait until the operation either completes or for the interval specified, whichever is the sooner. If no wait interval is given, and the operation is one that cannot complete immediately, \fBifconfig\fR will wait 30 seconds for the requested operation to complete. The symbolic value \fBforever\fR may be used as well, with obvious meaning.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdrop\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remove the specified interface from \fBDHCP\fR control without notifying the DHCP server, and record the current lease for later use. Additionally, for IPv4, set the IP address to zero. For IPv6, unplumb all logical interfaces plumbed by \fBdhcpagent\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBextend\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Attempt to extend the lease on the interface's IP address. This is not required, as the agent will automatically extend the lease well before it expires.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBinform\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Obtain network configuration parameters from \fBDHCP\fR without obtaining a lease on \fBIP\fR addresses. This is useful in situations where an \fBIP\fR address is obtained through mechanisms other than \fBDHCP\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBping\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check whether the interface given is under \fBDHCP\fR control, which means that the interface is managed by the \fBDHCP\fR agent and is working properly. An exit status of \fB0\fR means success.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBrelease\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Relinquish the IP addresses on the interface by notifying the server and discard the current lease. For IPv4, set the IP address to zero. For IPv6, all logical interfaces plumbed by \fBdhcpagent\fR are unplumbed.
.RE

\fB\fBauto-revarp\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) to automatically acquire an address for this interface. This will fail if the interface does not support RARP; for example, IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand), and on IPv6 interfaces.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fBbroadcast\fR \fIaddress\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
For IPv4 only. Specify the address to use to represent broadcasts to the network. The default broadcast address is the address with a host part of all \fB1\fR's. A "\fB+\fR" (plus sign) given for the broadcast value causes the broadcast address to be reset to a default appropriate for the (possibly new) address and netmask. The arguments of \fBifconfig\fR are interpreted left to right. Therefore
.sp
.in +2
.nf

.sp

and
.sp

Marks the logical interface as preferred. This option is only valid for IPv6 addresses. Addresses assigned to preferred logical interfaces are preferred as source addresses over all other addresses configured on the system, unless the address is of an inappropriate scope relative to the destination address. Preferred addresses are used as source addresses regardless of which physical interface they are assigned to. For example, you can configure a preferred source address on the loopback interface and advertise reachability of this address by using a routing protocol.

\fB\fBdown\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Mark a logical interface as "down". (That is, turn off the \fBIFF_UP\fR bit.) When a logical interface is marked "down," the system does not attempt to use the address assigned to that interface as a source address for outbound packets and will not recognize inbound packets destined to that address as being addressed to this host. Additionally, when all logical interfaces on a given physical interface are "down," the physical interface itself is disabled.
.sp
When a logical interface is down, all routes that specify that interface as the output (using the \fB-ifp\fR option in the \fBroute\fR(1M) command or \fBRTA_IFP\fR in a \fBroute\fR(7P) socket) are removed from the forwarding table. Routes marked with \fBRTF_STATIC\fR are returned to the table if the interface is brought back up, while routes not marked with \fBRTF_STATIC\fR are simply deleted.
.sp
When all logical interfaces that could possibly be used to reach a particular gateway address are brought down (specified without the interface option as in the previous paragraph), the affected gateway routes are treated as though they had the \fBRTF_BLACKHOLE\fR flag set. All matching packets are discarded because the gateway is unreachable.

Set the tunnel encapsulation limit for the interface to n. This option applies to IPv4-in-IPv6 and IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels only, and it simply modifies the \fBencaplimit\fR link property of the underlying IPv6 tunnel link (see \fBdladm\fR(1M)). The tunnel encapsulation limit controls how many more tunnels a packet can enter before it leaves any tunnel, that is, the tunnel nesting level.

For IPv4 only. Specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into subnetworks.

If a "\fB+\fR" (plus sign) is given for the netmask value, the mask is looked up in the \fBnetmasks\fR(4) database. This lookup finds the longest matching netmask in the database by starting with the interface's IPv4 address as the key and iteratively masking off more and more low order bits of the address. This iterative lookup ensures that the \fBnetmasks\fR(4) database can be used to specify the netmasks when variable length subnetmasks are used within a network number.
.sp
If a pseudo host name/pseudo network name is supplied as the netmask value, netmask data may be located in the \fBhosts\fR or \fBnetworks\fR database. Names are looked up by first using \fBgethostbyname\fR(3NSL). If not found there, the names are looked up in \fBgetnetbyname\fR(3SOCKET).

.sp
When an application does not choose a non-zero source address using \fBbind\fR(3SOCKET), the system will select an appropriate source address based on the outbound interface and the address selection rules (see \fBipaddrsel\fR(1M)).
.sp
When \fBusesrc\fR is specified and the specified interface is selected in the forwarding table for output, the system looks first to the specified physical interface and its associated logical interfaces when selecting a source address. If no usable address is listed in the forwarding table, the ordinary selection rules apply. For example, if you enter:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBifconfig eri0 usesrc vni0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

\&...and \fBvni0\fR has address 10.0.0.1 assigned to it, the system will prefer 10.0.0.1 as the source address for any packets originated by local connections that are sent through \fBeri0\fR. Further examples are provided in the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section.
.sp
While you can specify any physical interface (or even loopback), be aware that you can also specify the virtual IP interface (see \fBvni\fR(7D)). The virtual IP interface is not associated with any physical hardware and is thus immune to hardware failures. You can specify any number of physical interfaces to use the source address hosted on a single virtual interface. This simplifies the configuration of routing-based multipathing. If one of the physical interfaces were to fail, communication would continue through one of the remaining, functioning physical interfaces. This scenario assumes that the reachability of the address hosted on the virtual interface is advertised in some manner, for example, through a routing protocol.
.sp
Because the \fBifconfig\fR \fBpreferred\fR option is applied to all interfaces, it is coarser-grained than the \fBusesrc\fR option. It will be overridden by \fBusesrc\fR and \fBsetsrc\fR (route subcommand), in that order.

.SH LOGICAL INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
Solaris \fBTCP/IP\fR allows multiple logical interfaces to be associated with a physical network interface. This allows a single machine to be assigned multiple \fBIP\fR addresses, even though it may have only one network interface. Physical network interfaces have names of the form \fIdriver-name physical-unit-number\fR, while logical interfaces have names of the form \fIdriver-name physical-unit-number\fR\fB:\fR\fIlogical-unit-number\fR. A physical interface is configured into the system using the \fBplumb\fR command. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBifconfig eri0 plumb\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Once a physical interface has been "plumbed", logical interfaces associated with the physical interface can be configured by separate \fB-plumb\fR or \fB-addif\fR options to the \fBifconfig\fR command. 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBifconfig eri0:1 plumb\fR
.fi

allocates a specific logical interface associated with the physical interface \fBeri0\fR. The command

.sp

.sp
.LP
allocates the next available logical unit number on the \fBeri0\fR physical interface and assigns an \fIaddress\fR and \fIprefix_length\fR.
.sp
.LP
A logical interface can be configured with parameters ( \fIaddress\fR,\fIprefix_length\fR, and so on) different from the physical interface with which it is associated. Logical interfaces that are associated with the same physical interface can be given different parameters as well. Each logical interface must be associated with an existing and "up" physical interface. So, for example, the logical interface \fBeri0:1\fR can only be configured after the physical interface \fBeri0\fR has been plumbed.
.sp
.LP
To delete a logical interface, use the \fBunplumb\fR or \fBremoveif\fR options. For example, 
.sp
.in +2

.SH IP MULTIPATHING GROUPS
.sp
.LP
Physical interfaces that share the same link-layer broadcast domain \fBmust\fR be collected into a single IP Multipathing (IPMP) group using the \fBgroup\fR subcommand. Each IPMP group has an associated IPMP IP interface, which can either be explicitly created (the preferred method) by using the \fBipmp\fR subcommand or implicitly created by \fBifconfig\fR in response to placing an IP interface into a new IPMP group. Implicitly-created IPMP interfaces will be named \fBipmp\fR\fIN\fR where \fIN\fR is the lowest integer that does not conflict with an existing IP interface name or IPMP group name.
.sp
.LP
Each IPMP IP interface is created with a matching IPMP group name, though it can be changed using the \fBgroup\fR subcommand. Each IPMP IP interface hosts a set of highly-available IP addresses. These addresses will remain reachable so long as at least one interface in the group is active, where "active" is defined as having at least one \fBUP\fR address and having \fBINACTIVE\fR, \fBFAILED\fR, and \fBOFFLINE\fR clear. IP addresses hosted on the IPMP IP interface may either be configured statically or configured through DHCP by means of the \fBdhcp\fR subcommand.
.sp
.LP
Interfaces assigned to the same IPMP group are treated as equivalent and monitored for failure by \fBin.mpathd\fR. Provided that active interfaces in the group remain, IP interface failures (and any subsequent repairs) are handled transparently to sockets-based applications. IPMP is also integrated with the Dynamic Reconfiguration framework (see \fBcfgadm\fR(1M)), which enables network adapters to be replaced in a way that is invisible to sockets-based applications.
.sp
.LP
The IP module automatically load-spreads all outbound traffic across all active interfaces in an IPMP group. Similarly, all \fBUP\fR addresses hosted on the IPMP IP interface will be distributed across the active interfaces to promote inbound load-spreading. The \fBipmpstat\fR(1M) utility allows many aspects of the IPMP subsystem to be observed, including the current binding of IP data addresses to IP interfaces.
.sp
.LP
When an interface is placed into an IPMP group, any \fBUP\fR logical interfaces are "migrated" to the IPMP IP interface for use by the group, unless:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the logical interface is marked \fBNOFAILOVER\fR;
.RE
.RS +4

.ie t \(bu

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the logical interface hosts an IPv4 0.0.0.0 address.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Likewise, once an interface is in a group, if changes are made to a logical interface such that it is \fBUP\fR and not exempted by one of the conditions above, it will also migrate to the associated IPMP IP interface. Logical interfaces never migrate back, even if the physical interface that contributed the address is removed from the group.
.sp
.LP
Each interface placed into an IPMP group may be optionally configured with a "test" address that \fBin.mpathd\fR will use for probe-based failure detection; see \fBin.mpathd\fR(1M). These addresses must be marked \fBNOFAILOVER\fR (using the \fB-failover\fR subcommand) prior to being marked \fBUP\fR. Test addresses may also be acquired through DHCP by means of the \fBdhcp\fR subcommand.

.SH CONFIGURING IPV6 INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
When an IPv6 physical interface is plumbed and configured "up" with \fBifconfig\fR, it is automatically assigned an IPv6 link-local address for which the last 64 bits are calculated from the \fBMAC\fR address of the interface.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBifconfig eri0 inet6 plumb up\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example shows that the link-local address has a prefix of \fBfe80::/10\fR.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBifconfig eri0 inet6\fR
ce0: flags=2000841<UP,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv6>

        inet6 fe80::a00:20ff:fe8e:f3ad/10
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Link-local addresses are only used for communication on the local subnet and are not visible to other subnets.
.sp
.LP
If an advertising IPv6 router exists on the link advertising prefixes, then the newly plumbed IPv6 interface will autoconfigure logical interface(s) depending on the prefix advertisements. For example, for the prefix advertisement \fB2001:0db8:3c4d:0:55::/64\fR, the autoconfigured interface will look like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
eri0:2: flags=2080841<UP,RUNNING,MULTICAST,ADDRCONF,IPv6>
          mtu 1500 index 2

.fi
.in -2
.sp

Even if there are no prefix advertisements on the link, you can still assign global addresses manually, for example:
.sp

.SS "Configuring IP-over-IP Tunnel Interfaces"
.sp
.LP
An IP tunnel is conceptually comprised of two parts: a virtual link between two or more IP nodes, and an IP interface above this link which allows the system to transmit and receive IP packets encapsulated by the underlying link.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdladm\fR(1M) command is used to configure tunnel links, and \fBifconfig\fR is used to configure IP interfaces over those tunnel links. An IPv4-over-IPv4 tunnel is created by plumbing an IPv4 interface over an IPv4 tunnel link. An IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel is created by plumbing an IPv6 interface over an IPv6 tunnel link, and so forth.
.sp
.LP
When IPv6 interfaces are plumbed over IP tunnel links, their IPv6 addresses are automatically set. For IPv4 and IPv6 tunnels, source and destination link-local addresses of the form \fBfe80::\fR\fIinterface-id\fR are configured. For IPv4 tunnels, the \fIinterface-id\fR is the IPv4 tunnel source or destination address. For IPv6 tunnels, the \fIinterface-id\fR is the last 64 bits of the IPv6 tunnel source or destination address. For example, for an IPv4 tunnel between 10.1.2.3 and 10.4.5.6, the IPv6 link-local source and destination addresses of the IPv6 interface would be \fBfe80::a01:203\fR and \fBfe80::a04:506\fR. For an IPv6 tunnel between \fB2000::1234:abcd\fR and \fB3000::5678:abcd\fR, the IPv6 link-local source and destination addresses of the interface would be \fBfe80::1234:abcd\fR and \fBfe80::5678:abcd\fR. These default link-local addresses can be overridden by specifying the addresses explicitly, as with any other point-to-point interface.
.sp
.LP
For 6to4 tunnels, a 6to4 global address of the form \fB2002:\fItsrc\fR::1/16\fR is configured. The \fItsrc\fR portion is the tunnel source IPv4 address. The prefix length of the 6to4 interface is automatically set to 16, as all 6to4 packets (destinations in the \fB2002::/16\fR range) are forwarded to the 6to4 tunnel interface. For example, for a 6to4 link with a tunnel source of 75.1.2.3, the IPv6 interface would have an address of \fB2002:4b01:203::1/16\fR.
.sp
.LP
Additional IPv6 addresses can be added using the \fBaddif\fR option or by plumbing additional logical interfaces.
.sp
.LP
For backward compatibility, the plumbing of tunnel IP interfaces with special names will implicitly result in the creation of tunnel links without invoking \fBdladm create-iptun\fR. These tunnel names are:

These tunnels are "implicit tunnels", denoted with the \fBi\fR flag in \fBdladm show-iptun\fR output. The tunnel links over which these special IP interfaces are plumbed are automatically created, and they are automatically deleted when the last reference is released (that is, when the last IP interface is unplumbed).
.sp
.LP
The \fBtsrc\fR, \fBtdst\fR, \fBencaplim\fR, and \fBhoplimit\fR options to \fBifconfig\fR are obsolete and maintained only for backward compatibility. They are equivalent to their \fBdladm\fR(1M) counterparts.
.SS "Display of Tunnel Security Settings"
.sp
.LP
The \fBifconfig\fR output for IP tunnel interfaces indicates whether IPsec policy is configured for the underlying IP tunnel link. For example, a line of the following form will be displayed if IPsec policy is present:
