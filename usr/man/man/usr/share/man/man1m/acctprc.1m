.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBacctprc\fR reads the standard input and converts it to total accounting records (see the \fBtacct\fR record in \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD)). \fBacctprc\fR divides CPU time into prime time and non-prime time and determines mean memory size (in memory segment units). \fBacctprc\fR then summarizes the \fBtacct\fR records, according to user IDs, and adds login names corresponding to the user IDs. The summarized records are then written to the standard output. \fBacctprc1\fR reads input in the form described by \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD), adds login names corresponding to user \fBIDs,\fR then writes for each process an \fBASCII\fR line giving user \fBID,\fR login name, prime \fBCPU\fR time (tics), non-prime \fBCPU\fR time (tics), and mean memory size (in memory segment units). If \fIctmp\fR is given, it should contain a list of login sessions sorted by user \fBID\fR and login name. If this file is not supplied, it obtains login names from the password file, just as \fBacctprc\fR does. The information in \fIctmp\fR helps it distinguish between different login names that share the same user \fBID.\fR

From the standard input, \fBacctprc2\fR reads records in the form written by \fBacctprc1\fR, summarizes them according to user \fBID\fR and name, then writes the sorted summaries to the standard output as total accounting records.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Although it is possible for \fBacctprc1\fR to distinguish among login names that share user \fBIDs\fR for commands run from a command line, it is difficult for \fBacctprc1\fR to make this distinction for commands invoked in other ways. A command run from \fBcron\fR(1M) is an example of where \fBacctprc1\fR might have difficulty. A more precise conversion can be done using the \fBacctwtmp\fR program in \fBacct\fR(1M). \fBacctprc\fR does not distinguish between users with identical user IDs.

During a single invocation of any given command, the \fBacctprc\fR, \fBacctprc1\fR, and \fBacctprc2\fR commands can process a maximum of

If at some point the actual number of any one of these items exceeds the maximum, the command will not succeed.
