.SH NAME
luxadm \- administer Sun Fire 880 storage subsystem and FC_AL devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBluxadm\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... \fIenclosure\fR 
     [,\fIdev\fR] | \fIpathname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBluxadm\fR program is an administrative command that manages the \fBSENA\fR, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, and individual Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (\fBFC_AL\fR) devices. \fBluxadm\fR performs a variety of control and query tasks depending on the command line arguments and options used.
.sp
.LP
The command line must contain a subcommand. The command line may also contain options, usually at least one enclosure name or pathname, and other parameters depending on the subcommand. You need specify only as many characters as are required to uniquely identify a subcommand.
.sp
.LP
Specify the device that a subcommand interacts with by entering a pathname. For the \fBSENA\fR subsystem, a disk device or enclosure services controller may instead be specified by entering the World Wide Name (\fBWWN\fR) for the device or a port to the device. The device may also be specified by entering the name of the \fBSENA\fR enclosure, and an optional identifier for the particular device in the enclosure. The individual \fBFC_AL\fR devices may be specified by entering the \fBWWN\fR for the device or a port to the device.
.SS "Pathname"
.sp
.LP
Specify the device or controller by either a complete physical pathname or a complete logical pathname.
.sp
.LP
For \fBSENA,\fR a typical physical pathname for a device is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,socal@1,0/sf@0,0/ssd@w2200002037000f96,
         0:a,raw
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For all \fBSENA IBs\fR (Interface Boards) and Sun Fire 880 SES device controllers on the system, a logical link to the physical paths is kept in the directory \fB/dev/es\fR. An example of a logical link is \fB/dev/es/ses0\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBWWN\fR may be used in place of the pathname to select an \fBFC_AL\fR device, \fBSENA\fR subsystem IB, or Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem. The \fBWWN\fR is a unique 16 hexadecimal digit value that specifies either the port used to access the device or the device itself. A typical \fBWWN\fR value is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
2200002037000f96
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
See NOTES for more information on the \fBWWN\fR formats.
.sp
.LP
For a disk in a Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, a typical physical pathname is: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/devices/pci@8,600000/SUNW,qlc@2/fp@0,0/ssd@w2100002037a6303c,0:a
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and a typical logical pathname is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/dev/rdsk/c2t8d0s2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
For individual FC_AL devices, a typical physical pathname is: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/devices/sbus@3.0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@0,0/ssd@w2200002037049fc3,0:a,raw
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp

and a typical logical pathname is:
.sp

.nf

.fi
.in -2

.SS "Enclosure"
.sp
.LP
For \fBSENA,\fR a device may be identified by its enclosure name and slotname:
.br
.in +2
\fIbox_name\fR[\fB,f\fR\fIslot_number\fR]
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fIbox_name\fR[\fB,r\fR\fIslot_number\fR]
.in -2
.sp
.LP
\fIbox_name\fR is the name of the \fBSENA\fR enclosure, as specified by the \fBenclosure_name\fR subcommand. When used without the optional \fIslot_number\fR parameter, the \fIbox_name\fR identifies the \fBSENA\fR subsystem \fBIB.\fR
.sp
.LP
\fBf\fR or \fBr\fR specifies the front or rear slots in the \fBSENA\fR enclosure.
.sp
.LP
\fIslot_number\fR specifies the slot number of the device in the \fBSENA\fR enclosure, \fB0-6\fR or \fB0-10\fR.
.sp
.LP
For a Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, a device may also be identified by its enclosure name and slot name. However, there is only one set of disks:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIbox_name\fR[,\fIsslot_number\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fIbox_name\fR is the name of the Sun Fire 880 enclosure, as specified by the \fBenclosure_name\fR subcommand. When used without the optional \fIslot_number\fR parameter, \fIbox_name\fR identifies the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem enclosure services device. Use \fIs\fR to specify the disk slot number in the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, \fB0\fR - \fB11\fR.
.sp
.LP
See \fBdisks\fR(1M) and \fBdevlinks\fR(1M) for additional information on logical names for disks and subsystems.

For the \fBSENA\fR, if more than one enclosure has been specified, concurrent hot insertions on multiple busses can be performed. With no arguments to the subcommand, entire enclosures or individual \fBFC_AL\fR drives can be inserted. For the \fBSENA\fR or the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, this subcommand guides the user interactively through the hot insertion steps of a new device or chain of devices. If a list of disks was entered it will ask the user to verify the list of devices to be inserted is correct, at which point the user can continue or quit.

You must be careful not to quiesce a bus that contains the root or the \fB/usr\fR filesystems or any swap data. If you do quiesce such a bus a deadlock can result, requiring a system reboot.
