\fBlogadm\fR [\fB-\fIoptions\fR\fR] \fIlogname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBlogadm\fR is a general log rotation tool that is suitable for running from \fBcron\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Without arguments, \fBlogadm\fR reads the \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR file, and for every entry found in that file checks the corresponding log file to see if it should be rotated. Typically this check is done each morning by an entry in the root's \fBcrontab\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIlogname\fR argument is specified, \fBlogadm\fR renames the corresponding log file by adding a suffix so that the most recent log file ends with \fB\&.0\fR (that is, \fIlogfile\fR\fB\&.0\fR), the next most recent ends with \fB\&.1\fR (that is, \fIlogfile\fR\fB\&.1\fR), and so forth. By default, ten versions of old log files are kept (that is, \fIlogfile\fR\fB\&.0\fR through \fIlogfile\fR\fB\&.9\fR). At the point when what would be the eleventh file is logged, \fBlogadm\fR automatically deletes the oldest version to keep the count of files at ten.
.sp
.LP
\fBlogadm\fR takes a number of \fIoptions\fR. You can specify these options on the command line or in the \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR file. The \fBlogadm\fR command searches \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR for lines of the form \fIlogname\fR \fIoptions\fR 
.sp

\fB\fIlogname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Identifies an entry in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR. This can be a name or the pathname of the log file. If you specify a log file, rather than a name, for this field, it must be a fully qualified pathname.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Identifies command line options exactly as they would be entered on the command line. This allows commonly used log rotation policies to be stored in the \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR file. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR. 
.sp
If \fIoptions\fR are specified both in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR and on the command line, those in the \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR file are applied first. Therefore, the command line options override those in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR. 
.sp
Log file names specified in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR may contain filename substitution characters such as \fB*\fR and \fB?\fR, that are supported by \fBcsh\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.LP
Two options control when a log file is rotated. They are: \fB-s\fR size \fB-p\fR period.
.sp
.LP
When using more than one of these options at a time, there is an implied \fBand\fR between them. This means that all conditions must be met before the log is rotated.
.sp
.LP
If neither of these two options are specified, the default conditions for rotating a log file are: \fB\fR\fB-s\fR \fB1b\fR \fB-p\fR \fB1w\fR, which means the log file is only rotated if the size is non-zero and if at least 1 week has passed since the last time it was rotated.
.sp
.LP
By specifying \fB\fR\fB-p\fR \fBnever\fR as a rotation condition, any other rotation conditions are ignored and \fBlogadm\fR moves on to the expiration of old log files. By specifying \fB\fR\fB-p\fR \fBnow\fR as a rotation condition, a log rotation is forced.
.sp
.LP
Unless specified by the \fB-o\fR, \fB-g\fR, or \fB-m\fR options, \fBlogadm\fR replaces the log file (after renaming it) by creating an empty file whose owner, group ID, and permissions match the original file. 
.sp
.LP
Three options control when old log files are expired: \fB-A\fR age \fB-C\fR count \fB-S\fR size. These options expire the oldest log files until a particular condition or conditions are met. For example, the combination \fB\fR\fB-C\fR \fB5\fR and the \fB\fR\fB-S\fR \fB10m\fR options expires old log files until there are no more than 5 of the \fBand\fR their combined disk usage is no more than 10 megabytes. If none of these options are specified, the default expiration is \fB\fR\fB-C\fR \fB10\fR which keeps ten old log files. If no files are to be expired, use \fB\fR\fB-C\fR \fB0\fR to prevent expiration by default.
.sp
.LP
\fBlogadm\fR stores timestamps in the file \fB/var/logadm/timestamps\fR. For users of previous versions of \fBlogadm\fR, the utility automatically moves timestamps from \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR, their previous repository, to \fB/var/logadm/timestamps\fR.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\fB-a\fR \fIpost_command\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Execute the \fIpost_command\fR after renaming the log file. \fIpost_command\fR is passed to \fBsh\fR \fB-c\fR.
.sp
Specify \fIpost_command\fR as a valid shell command. Use quotes to protect spaces or shell metacharacters in \fIpost_command\fR. 
.sp
This option can be used to restart a daemon that is writing to the file. When rotating multiple logs with one \fBlogadm\fR command, \fIpost_command\fR is executed only once after all the logs are rotated, not once per rotated log.

.sp
Specify \fIpre_command\fR as a valid shell command. Use quotes to protect spaces or shell metacharacters in the \fIpre_command\fR. 
.sp
This option can be used to stop a daemon that is writing to the file. When rotating multiple logs with one \fBlogadm\fR command, \fIpre_command\fR is executed only once before all the logs are rotated, not once per rotated log.
.RE

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Delete the oldest versions until there are not more than \fIcount\fR files left.
.sp
If no expire options (\fB-A\fR, \fB-C\fR, or \fB-S\fR) are specified, \fB\fR\fB-C\fR \fB10\fR is the default. To prevent the default expire rule from being added automatically, specify \fB\fR\fB-C\fR \fB0\fR .

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Send error messages by email to \fImail_addr\fR. 
.sp
As \fBlogadm\fR is typically run from \fBcron\fR(1M), error messages are captured by \fBcron\fR and mailed to the owner of the \fBcrontab\fR.
.sp
This option is useful if you want the mail regarding error messages to go to another address instead. If no errors are encountered, no mail message is generated.

\fB\fB-E\fR \fIcmd\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Execute \fIcmd\fR to expire the file, rather than deleting the old log file to expire it.
.sp
\fIcmd\fR is passed it to \fBsh\fR \fB-c\fR. The file is considered expired after \fIcmd\fR completes. If the old log file is not removed or renamed by the \fIcmd\fR, \fBlogadm\fR considers it for expiration the next time that it runs on the specified log file. If present, the keyword \fB$file\fR is expanded in the specified \fIcmd\fRto the name of the file being expired.
.sp
This option is useful for tasks such as mailing old log files to administrators, or copying old log files to long term storage.

Similarly, the keyword \fB$nfile\fR is expanded to the new name of the log file. The \fB$nfile\fR keyword is only available with commands provided with the \fB-M\fR option. After the command completes, the log file is replaced by the rotate file. The default \fIcmd\fR is "\fB/bin/mv\fR \fB$file\fR\fB\fR\fB$nfile\fR".

Print the actions that the \fBlogadm\fR command will perform without actually performing them.
.sp
This option is useful for checking arguments before making any changes to the system.
.sp
It is important to remember, however, that since log rotating actions are only printed with this option, \fBlogadm\fR might not find files that need expiring, but if run without the \fB-n\fR \fBlogadm\fR might create a file that needs expiring by performing the log rotating actions. Therefore, if you see no files being expired with the \fB-n\fR option, files still might be expired without it.

This option is useful for processing log file contents after rotating the log. \fIcmd\fR is executed by passing it to \fBsh\fR \fB-c\fR. When rotating multiple logs with one logadm command, the command supplied with \fB-R\fR is executed once every time a log is rotated.

To actually have the dollar sign character in the file name, use \fB$$\fR. Any percent sequences allowed by \fBstrftime\fR(3C) are also allowed, for example, \fB%d\fR expands to the day of the month. To actually have a percent sign character in the file name, use \fB%%\fR. Both dollar-sign keywords and percent sequences can appear anywhere in the template. If the template results in a pathname with non-existent directories, they are created as necessary when rotating the log file.
.sp
If no \fB-t\fR option is specified, the default template is \fB$file.$n\fR. Actual \fBrotation\fR of log files, where each version is shifted up until it expires is done using the \fB$n\fR keyword.

This option is useful if another program fiddles with the old log file names, like a \fBcron\fR job to compress them over time. The pattern is in the form of a pathname with special characters such as \fB*\fR and \fB?\fR as supported by \fBcsh\fR(1) filename substitution.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
 % logadm -w apache -p 1m -C 24\e
     -t '/var/apache/old-logs/$basename.%Y-%m'\e
     -a '/usr/apache/bin/apachectl graceful'\e
     '/var/apache/logs/*{access,error}_log'
.fi
.in -2

This example also illustrates that the entry name supplied with the \fB-w\fR option doesn't have to match the log file name. In this example, the entry name is \fBapache\fR and once the line has been run, the entry in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR can be forced to run by executing the following command: 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
% logadm -p now apache
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Because the expression matching the apache log file names was enclosed in quotes, the expression is stored in \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR, rather than the list of files that it expands to. This means that each time \fBlogadm\fR runs from \fBcron\fR it expands that expression and checks all the log files in the resulting list to see if they need rotating. 

.sp
.LP
The following command is an example without the quotes around the log name expression. The shell expands the last argument into a list of log files that exist at the time the command is entered, and writes an entry to \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR that rotates the files.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
logadm -w apache /var/apache/logs/*_log
.fi
.in -2

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When \fBlogadm\fR applies expire conditions (supplied by the \fB-A\fR, \fB-C\fR, and \fB-S\fR options), it deletes files, the oldest first, until the conditions are satisfied. If the template used for naming the old logs contained \fB$n\fR or \fB$N\fR, \fBlogadm\fR picks the highest value of \fB$n\fR or \fB$N\fR found in the old log file names first. If the template used is something else, \fBlogadm\fR uses the modification time to determine which files to expire first. This may not be the expected behavior if an old log file has been modified since it was rotated.
.sp
.LP
Depending on log file sizes and number of log files, log file rotations can be very time-consuming.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBlogadm\fR works in \fBUTC\fR. Therefore, all entries written to the \fB/etc/logadm.conf\fR file (see \fBlogadm.conf\fR(4)) will have a \fBUTC\fR timestamp. Users can use the \fB-l\fR option to set \fBlogadm\fR to local time.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-f\fR and \fB-F\fR options can specify the same file, in which case \fBlogadm\fR reverts to the same behavior as in prior releases. That is, timestamps are written to the configuration file.
