.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBconsadm\fR selects the hardware \fIdevice\fR or devices to be used as auxiliary console devices, or displays the current device. Only superusers are allowed to make or display auxiliary console device selections.
.sp
.LP
Auxiliary console devices receive copies of \fBconsole\fR messages, and can be used as the console during \fBsingle user\fR mode. In particular, they receive kernel messages and messages directed to \fB/dev/sysmsg\fR. On Solaris x86 based systems they can also be used for interaction with the bootstrap.
.sp
.LP
By default, selecting a display device to be used as an auxiliary console device selects that device for the duration the system remains up. If the administrator needs the selection to persist across reboots the \fB-p\fR option can be specified.
.sp
.LP
\fBconsadm\fR runs a daemon in the background, monitoring auxiliary console devices. Any devices that are disconnected (hang up, lose carrier) are removed from the auxiliary console device list, though not from the persistent list. While auxiliary console devices may have been removed from the device list receiving copies of \fBconsole\fR messages, those messages will always continue to be displayed by the default console device.
.sp
.LP
The daemon will not run if it finds there are not any auxiliary devices configured to monitor. Likewise, after the last auxiliary console is removed, the daemon will shut itself down. Therefore the daemon persists for only as long as auxiliary console devices remain active.
.sp
.LP
See \fBeeprom\fR(1M) for instructions on assigning an auxiliary console device as the system console.
