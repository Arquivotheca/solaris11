.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgchk\fR checks the accuracy of installed files or, by using the \fB-l\fR option, displays information about package files. \fBpkgchk\fR checks the integrity of directory structures and files. Discrepancies are written to standard error along with a detailed explanation of the problem.
.sp
.LP
The first synopsis defined above is used to list or check the contents and/or attributes of objects that are currently installed on the system, or in the indicated \fBpkgmap\fR. Package names may be listed on the command line, or by default, the entire contents of a machine will be checked.
.sp
.LP
The second synopsis is used to list or check the contents of a package which has been spooled on the specified device, but not installed. Note that attributes cannot be checked for spooled packages.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Audit the file attributes only and do not check file contents. Default is to check both.

.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the device on which a spooled package resides. \fIdevice\fR can be a directory path name or the identifiers for tape or removable medium (for example, \fB/var/tmp\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-e\fR \fIenvfile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Request that the package information file named as \fIenvfile\fR be used to resolve parameters noted in the specified \fBpkgmap\fR file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Correct file attributes if possible. If used with the \fB-x\fR option, this option removes hidden files. When \fBpkgchk\fR is invoked with this option, it creates directories, named pipes, links, and special devices if they do not already exist. If the \fB-d\fR option calls out an uninstalled package, the \fB-f\fR option will only take effect if the package is in directory (not stream) format. All file attributes will be set to agree with the entries in the \fBpkgmap\fR file except that setuid, setgid, and sticky bits will not be set in the mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-i\fR \fIfile\fR | \fB-\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Read a list of path names from \fIfile\fR or from stdin (\fB-\fR) and compare this list against the installation software database or the indicated \fBpkgmap\fR file. Path names that are not contained in \fIfile\fR or stdin are not checked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
List information on the selected files that make up a package. This option is not compatible with the \fB-a\fR, \fB-c\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-g\fR, and \fB-v\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fBpkgmap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check the package against the package map file, \fBpkgmap\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Instruct \fBpkgchk\fR not to use the \fB$\fR\fIroot_path\fR\fB/etc/vfstab\fR file for determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Do not check volatile or editable files' contents. This should be used for most post-installation checking. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-p\fR \fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check the accuracy only of the path name or path names listed. \fIpath\fR can be one or more path names separated by commas (or by whitespace, if the list is quoted).
.sp
To specify a \fIpath\fR that includes a comma, you must use the \fB-i\fR option, described above. See EXAMPLES.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-P\fR \fIpartial-path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Check the accuracy of only the partial path name or path names listed. \fIpartial-path\fR can be one or more partial path names separated by commas (or by whitespace, if the list is quoted). This option can be used instead of \fB-p\fR and is not compatible with the other option. This option matches any path name that contains the string contained in the partial path. See the note about paths that contain commas in the description of \fB-p\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-q\fR\fR

Quiet mode. Do not give messages about missing files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Define the full name of a directory to use as the \fIroot_path\fR. All files, including package system information files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified \fIroot_path\fR. The \fIroot_path\fR may be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example, \fB/export/root/client1\fR).
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a datastream of  up to 4 GB.
