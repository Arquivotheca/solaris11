.SH NAME
automount \- install automatic mount points
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/automount\fR [\fB-t\fR \fIduration\fR] [\fB-v\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBautomount\fR utility installs \fBautofs\fR mount points and associates an automount map with each mount point. It starts the \fBautomountd\fR(1M) daemon if it finds any non-trivial entries in either local or distributed automount maps and if the daemon is not already running. The \fBautofs\fR file system monitors attempts to access directories within it and notifies the \fBautomountd\fR(1M) daemon. The daemon uses the map to locate a file system, which it then mounts at the point of reference within the \fBautofs\fR file system. A map can be assigned to an \fBautofs\fR mount using an entry in the \fB/etc/auto_master\fR map or a direct map.
.sp
.LP
If the file system is not accessed within an appropriate interval (\fB10\fR minutes by default), the \fBautomountd\fR daemon unmounts the file system.
.sp
.LP
The file \fB/etc/auto_master\fR determines the locations of all \fBautofs\fR mount points. By default, this file contains three entries:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# Master map for automounter
#
+auto_master
/net          -hosts    -nosuid
/home         auto_home
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB+auto_master\fR entry is a reference to an external \fBNIS\fR master map. If one exists, then its entries are read as if they occurred in place of the \fB+auto_master\fR entry. The remaining entries in the master file specify a directory on which an \fBautofs\fR mount will be made followed by the automounter map to be associated with it. Optional mount options may be supplied as an optional third field in the each entry. These options are used for any entries in the map that do not specify mount options explicitly. The \fBautomount\fR command is usually run without arguments. It compares the entries \fB/etc/auto_master\fR with the current list of \fBautofs\fR mounts in \fB/etc/mnttab\fR and adds, removes or updates \fBautofs\fR mounts to bring the \fB/etc/mnttab\fR up to date with the \fB/etc/auto_master\fR. At boot time it installs all \fBautofs\fR mounts from the master map. Subsequently, it may be run to install \fBautofs\fR mounts for new entries in the master map or the direct map, or to perform unmounts for entries that have been removed from these maps.
.SS "SMF Management"
.sp
.LP
The \fBautomount\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/system/filesystem/autofs:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
Startup autofs SMF parameters for \fBautomount\fR can be manipulated using \fBsharectl\fR(1M). Refer to \fBsharectl\fR(1M) for instructions for viewing and updating these parameters. Supported parameters are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBtimeout\fR=\fInum\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a duration, in seconds, that a file system is to remain mounted when not in use. The default value is \fB600\fR (10 minutes). Equivalent to the \fB-t\fR option in \fBautomount\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBautomount_verbose\fR=\fBTRUE\fR | \fBFALSE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Verbose mode. Causes you to be notified of non-critical events, suchs as \fBautofs\fR mounts and unmounts. The default value is \fBFALSE\fR. Equivalent to the \fB-v\fR option in \fBautomount\fR.

.SS "Automount with Oracle Solaris Trusted Extensions"
.sp
.LP
If a system is configured with Oracle Solaris Trusted Extensions, users have home directories at each label within their clearance. Therefore a home directory needs to be available in each corresponding labeled zone. Instead of using the \fBauto_home\fR map, a special map is automatically generated, using the zone's name as a suffix. By default the map contains the single entry:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
-fstype=lofs   :/export/home/&
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When a home directory is referenced and the name does not match any other keys in the zone's \fBauto_home_\fR\fIzonename\fR map, it will match this loopback mount specification. If this loopback match occurs and the name corresponds to a valid user whose home directory does not exist in the zone, the directory is automatically created on behalf of the user.
.sp
.LP
It is also possible to share home directories in a zone, in read-only mode, with higher-level zones, using NFS. In this case, the higher-level zone needs to have an automap entry for each lower-level zone that is to be imported. A typical map entry for the public zone, to be interpreted in the internal zone, would be called \fBauto_home_public\fR, and would look like this:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
+auto_home_public

\fIpublic-zone-IP-address\fR:/export/home/&
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This automap entry would then be included in \fB/etc/auto_master\fR, as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/zone/public/home      auto_home_public      -nobrowse
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Users in higher-level zones can use the \fBupdatehome\fR(1) utility to synchronize specific startup files using their minimum labeled zone as the source.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.SH USAGE
.SS "Map Entry Format"
.sp
.LP
A simple map entry (mapping) takes the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
key [ -\fImount-options\fR ] \fIlocation\fR .\|.\|.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fBkey\fR is the full pathname of the directory to mount when used in a direct map, or the simple name of a subdirectory in an indirect map. \fImount-options\fR is a comma-separated list of \fBmount\fR options, and \fIlocation\fR specifies a file system from which the directory may be mounted. In the case of a simple \fBNFS\fR mount, the options that can be used are as specified in \fBmount_nfs\fR(1M), and \fIlocation\fR takes the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIhost\fR\fB:\|\fR\fIpathname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fIhost\fR is the name of the host from which to mount the file system, and \fIpathname\fR is the absolute pathname of the directory to mount.
.sp
.LP
Options to other file systems are documented on the other \fBmount_*\fR reference manual pages, for example, \fBmount_nfs\fR(1M).
.SS "Replicated File Systems"
.sp
.LP
Multiple \fIlocation\fR fields can be specified for replicated \fBNFS\fR file systems, in which case \fBautomount\fR and the kernel will each try to use that information to increase availability. If the read-only flag is set in the map entry, \fBautomountd\fR mounts a list of locations that the kernel may use, sorted by several criteria. Only locations available at mount time will be mounted, and thus be available to the kernel. When a server does not respond, the kernel will switch to an alternate server. The sort ordering of \fBautomount\fR is used to determine how the next server is chosen. If the read-only flag is not set, \fBautomount\fR will mount the best single location, chosen by the same sort ordering, and new servers will only be chosen when an unmount has been possible, and a remount is done. Servers on the same local subnet are given the strongest preference, and servers on the local net are given the second strongest preference. Among servers equally far away, response times will determine the order if no weighting factors (see below) are used.
.sp
.LP
If the list includes server locations using both the \fBNFS\fR Version 2 Protocol and the \fBNFS\fR Version 3 Protocol, \fBautomount\fR will choose only a subset of the server locations on the list, so that all entries will be the same protocol. It will choose servers with the \fBNFS\fR Version 3 Protocol so long as an \fBNFS\fR Version 2 Protocol server on a local subnet will not be ignored. See the \fI\fR for additional details.
.sp
.LP
If each \fIlocation\fR in the list shares the same \fIpathname\fR then a single \fIlocation\fR may be used with a comma-separated list of hostnames:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBhostname\fR\fB,\fR\fBhostname\fR\|.\|.\|.\|\fB:\fR\|\fIpathname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Requests for a server may be weighted, with the weighting factor appended to the server name as an integer in parentheses. Servers without a weighting are assumed to have a value of zero (most likely to be selected). Progressively higher values decrease the chance of being selected. In the example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBman\fR -ro \fBalpha,bravo,charlie(1),delta(4)\|:\|/usr/man\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
hosts \fBalpha\fR and \fBbravo\fR have the highest priority; host \fBdelta\fR has the lowest.
.sp
.LP
Server proximity takes priority in the selection process. In the example above, if the server \fBdelta\fR is on the same network segment as the client, but the others are on different network segments, then \fBdelta\fR will be selected; the weighting value is ignored. The weighting has effect only when selecting between servers with the same network proximity. The automounter always selects the localhost over other servers on the same network segment, regardless of weighting.
.sp
.LP
In cases where each server has a different export point, the weighting can still be applied. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
man -ro alpha:/usr/man  bravo,charlie(1):/usr/share/man  
     delta(3):/export/man
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A mapping can be continued across input lines by escaping the \fBNEWLINE\fR with a backslash (\e) Comments begin with a number sign (\fB#\fR) and end at the subsequent NEWLINE.
.SS "Map Key Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The ampersand (\fB&\fR) character is expanded to the value of the \fBkey\fR field for the entry in which it occurs. In this case:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBjane\fR \fBsparcserver\|:\|/home/&\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
the \fB&\fR expands to \fBjane\fR.
.SS "Wildcard Key"
.sp
.LP
The asterisk (\fB*\fR) character, when supplied as the \fBkey\fR field, is recognized as the catch-all entry. Such an entry will match any key not previously matched. For instance, if the following entry appeared in the indirect map for \fB/config\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
*         &\|:\|/export/config/&
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
this would allow automatic mounts in \fB/config\fR of any remote file system whose location could be specified as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
hostname\|:\|/export/config/hostname
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that the wildcard key does not work in conjunction with the \fB-browse\fR option.
.SS "Variable Substitution"
.sp
.LP
Client specific variables can be used within an \fBautomount\fR map. For instance, if \fB$HOST\fR appeared within a map, \fBautomount\fR would expand it to its current value for the client's host name. Supported variables are:
.sp

.LP
If a reference needs to be protected from affixed characters, you can surround the variable name with curly braces (\fB\|{\|}\|\fR).
.SS "Multiple Mounts"
.sp
.LP
A multiple mount entry takes the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
key [\fI-mount-options\fR] [\|[\fImountpoint\fR] [\fI-mount-options\fR] \fIlocation\fR.\|.\|.\|]\|.\|.\|.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The initial \fB/\fR[\fImountpoint\fR\|] is optional for the first mount and mandatory for all subsequent mounts. The optional \fImountpoint\fR is taken as a pathname relative to the directory named by \fBkey\fR. If \fImountpoint\fR is omitted in the first occurrence, a \fImountpoint\fR of \fB/\fR (root) is implied.
.sp
.LP
Given an entry in the indirect map for \fB/src\fR
.sp
.in +2
.nf
beta     -ro\e
  /           svr1,svr2:/export/src/beta  \e
  /1.0        svr1,svr2:/export/src/beta/1.0  \e
  /1.0/man    svr1,svr2:/export/src/beta/1.0/man
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
All offsets must exist on the server under \fBbeta\fR. \fBautomount\fR will automatically mount \fB/src/beta\fR, \fB/src/beta/1.0\fR, and \fB/src/beta/1.0/man\fR, as needed, from either \fBsvr1\fR or \fBsvr2\fR, whichever host is nearest and responds first.
.SS "Other File System Types"
.sp
.LP
The automounter assumes \fBNFS\fR mounts as a default file system type. Other file system types can be described using the \fBfstype\fR mount option. Other mount options specific to this file system type can be combined with the \fBfstype\fR option. The location field must contain information specific to the file system type. If the location field begins with a slash, a colon character must be prepended, for instance, to mount a CD file system:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBcdrom -fstype=hsfs,ro   :\|/dev/sr0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
or to perform an \fBautofs\fR mount:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBsrc\fR \fB-fstype\fR\fB=autofs    auto_src\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Use this procedure only if you are not using Volume Manager.
.sp
.LP
See the \fBNOTES\fR section for information on option inheritance.
.SS "Indirect Maps"
.sp
.LP
An indirect map allows you to specify mappings for the subdirectories you wish to mount under the \fBdirectory\fR indicated on the command line. In an indirect map, each \fBkey\fR consists of a simple name that refers to one or more file systems that are to be mounted as needed.
.SS "Direct Maps"
.sp
.LP
Entries in a direct map are associated directly with \fBautofs\fR mount points. Each \fIkey\fR is the full pathname of an \fBautofs\fR mount point. The direct map as a whole is not associated with any single directory.
.sp
.LP
Direct maps are distinguished from indirect maps by the \fB/-\fR key. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# Master map for automounter
#
+auto_master
/net            -hosts          -nosuid,nobrowse
/home           auto_home       -nobrowse
/-              auto_direct
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Included Maps"
.sp
.LP
The contents of another map can be included within a map with an entry of the form
.sp
.in +2
.nf
+\fImapname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If \fImapname\fR begins with a slash, it is assumed to be the pathname of a local file. Otherwise, the location of the map is determined by the policy of the name service switch according to the entry for the automounter in \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR, such as
.sp
.in +2
.nf
automount: files nis
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the name service is \fBfiles\fR, then the name is assumed to be that of a local file in \fB/etc\fR. If the key being searched for is not found in the included map, the search continues with the next entry.
.SS "Special Maps"
.sp
.LP
There are three special maps available: \fB-hosts\fR, \fB-fedfs\fR and \fB-null\fR. The \fB-hosts\fR map is used with the \fB/net\fR directory and assumes that the map key is the hostname of an NFS server. The \fBautomountd\fR daemon dynamically constructs a map entry from the server's list of exported file systems. References to a directory under \fB/net/hermes\fR will refer to the corresponding directory relative to \fBhermes\fR root.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-fedfs\fR map is used with the \fB/nfs4\fR directory and assumes that the map key is the DNS domain for which the domain root filesystem is needed. The \fBautomountd\fR daemon looks up the domain root servers with a query equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBnslookup -q=srv _nfs4._domainroot._tcp.\fIdomain\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...and mounts \fIserver-list\fR\fB:/.domainroot-\fR\fIdomain\fR at \fB/nfs4/\fR\fIdomain\fR.
.sp
.LP
This supports the pending IETF standard documented in:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/\e
draft-ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-dns-srv-namespace/
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-null\fR map cancels a previous map for the directory indicated. This is most useful in the \fB/etc/auto_master\fR for cancelling entries that would otherwise be inherited from the \fB+auto_master\fR include entry. To be effective, the \fB-null\fR entries must be inserted before the included map entry.
.SS "Executable Maps"
.sp
.LP
Local maps that have the execute bit set in their file permissions will be executed by the automounter and provided with a key to be looked up as an argument. The executable map is expected to return the content of an automounter map entry on its stdout or no output if the entry cannot be determined. A direct map cannot be made executable.
.SS "Configuration and the auto_master Map"
.sp
.LP
When initiated without arguments, \fBautomount\fR consults the master map for a list of \fBautofs\fR mount points and their maps. It mounts any \fBautofs\fR mounts that are not already mounted, and unmounts \fBautofs\fR mounts that have been removed from the master map or direct map.
.sp
.LP
The master map is assumed to be called \fBauto_master\fR and its location is determined by the name service switch policy. Normally the master map is located initially as a local file \fB/etc/auto_master\fR.
.SS "Browsing"
.sp
.LP
The \fBautomount\fR daemon supports browsability of indirect maps. This allows all of the potential mount points to be visible, whether or not they are mounted. The \fB-nobrowse\fR option can be added to any indirect \fBautofs\fR map to disable browsing. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/net     -hosts      -nosuid,nobrowse
/home    auto_home
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this case, any \fIhostnames\fR would only be visible in \fB/net\fR after they are mounted, but all potential mount points would be visible under \fB/home\fR. The \fB-browse\fR option enables browsability of \fBautofs\fR file systems. This is the default for all indirect maps.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-browse\fR option does not work in conjunction with the wildcard key.
.SS "Restricting Mount Maps"
.sp
.LP
Options specified for a map are used as the default options for all the entries in that map. They are ignored when map entries specify their own mount options.
.sp
.LP
In some cases, however, it is desirable to force \fBnosuid\fR, \fBnodevices\fR, \fBnosetuid\fR, or \fBnoexec\fR for a complete mount map and its submounts. This can be done by specifying the additional mount option, \fB-restrict\fR. 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
 /home     auto_home       -restrict,nosuid,hard
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-restrict\fR option forces the inheritance of all the restrictive options \fBnosuid\fR, \fBnodevices\fR, \fBnosetuid\fR, and \fBnoexec\fR as well as the restrict option itself. In this particular example, the \fBnosuid\fR and \fBrestrict\fR option are inherited but the \fBhard\fR option is not. The \fBrestrict\fR option also prevents the execution of "executable maps" and is enforced for auto mounts established by programs with fewer than all privileges available in their zone.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBautofs\fR mount points must not be hierarchically related. \fBautomount\fR does not allow an \fBautofs\fR mount point to be created within another \fBautofs\fR mount.
.sp
.LP
Since each direct map entry results in a new \fBautofs\fR mount such maps should be kept short.
.sp
.LP
Entries in both direct and indirect maps can be modified at any time. The new information is used when \fBautomountd\fR next uses the map entry to do a mount.
.sp
.LP
New entries added to a master map or direct map will not be useful until the automount command is run to install them as new \fBautofs\fR mount points. New entries added to an indirect map may be used immediately.
.sp
.LP
As of the Solaris 2.6 release, a listing (see \fBls\fR(1)) of the \fBautofs\fR directory associated with an indirect map shows all potential mountable entries. The attributes associated with the potential mountable entries are temporary. The real file system attributes will only be shown once the file system has been mounted.
.sp
.LP
Default mount options can be assigned to an entire map when specified as an optional third field in the master map. These options apply only to map entries that have no mount options. Note that map entities with options override the default options, as at this time, the options do not concatenate. The concatenation feature is planned for a future release.
.sp
.LP
When operating on a map that invokes an NFS mount, the default number of retries for the automounter is 0, that is, a single mount attempt, with no retries. Note that this is significantly different from the default (10000) for the \fBmount_nfs\fR(1M) utility.
.sp
.LP
The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains the same.
