.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBtmpfs\fR is a memory based file system which uses kernel resources relating to the \fBVM\fR system and page cache as a file system.
.sp
.LP
\fBmount\fR attaches a \fBtmpfs\fR file system to the file system hierarchy at the pathname location \fImount_point\fR, which must already exist. If \fImount_point\fR has any contents prior to the \fBmount\fR operation, these remain hidden until the file system is once again unmounted. The attributes (mode, owner, and group) of the root of the \fBtmpfs\fR filesystem are inherited from the underlying \fImount_point\fR, provided that those attributes are determinable. If not, the root's attributes are set to their default values.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspecial\fR argument is usually specified as \fBswap\fR but is in fact disregarded and assumed to be the virtual memory resources within the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIspecific_options\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Specify \fBtmpfs\fR file system specific options in a comma-separated list with no intervening spaces. If invalid options are specified, a warning  message is printed and the invalid options are ignored. The following options are available: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBsize=\fIsz\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
The \fIsz\fR argument controls the size of this particular \fBtmpfs\fR file system. If the argument is has a `k' suffix, the number will be interpreted as a number of kilobytes. An `m' suffix will be interpreted as a number of megabytes. No suffix is interpreted as bytes. In all cases, the actual size of the file system is the number of bytes specified, rounded up to the physical pagesize of the system.

Overlay  mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file system inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount will fail, producing the error\f(CWdevice busy\fR.

.SH NOTES

.LP
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.
