.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBinstallf\fR informs the system that a pathname not listed in the \fBpkgmap\fR(4) file is being created or modified. It should be invoked before any file modifications have occurred.
.sp
.LP
When the second synopsis is used, the pathname descriptions will be read from standard input. These descriptions are the same as would be given in the first synopsis but the information is given in the form of a list. The descriptions should be in the form:
.sp
.LP
\fIpathname\fR [ \fIftype\fR [\| \fImajor\fR \fIminor\fR ] [ \fImode\fR \fIowner\fR \fIgroup\fR ]\|]
.sp
.LP
After all files have been appropriately created and/or modified, \fBinstallf\fR should be invoked with the \fB-f\fR synopsis to indicate that installation is final. Links will be created at this time and, if attribute information for a pathname was not specified during the original invocation of \fBinstallf\fR, or was not already stored on the system, the current attribute values for the pathname will be stored. Otherwise, \fBinstallf\fR verifies that attribute values match those given on the command line, making corrections as necessary. In all cases, the current content information is calculated and stored appropriately.
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a datastream of  up to 4 GB.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

Class to which installed objects should be associated. Default class is \fBnone\fR.

.sp

\fB\fB-f\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Instruct \fBinstallf\fR not to use the \fB$\fR\fIroot_path\fR\fB/etc/vfstab\fR file for determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Define the full path name of a directory to use as the \fIroot_path\fR. All files, including package system information files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified \fIroot_path\fR. The \fIroot_path\fR can be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example, \fB/export/root/client1\fR).
.sp
\fBinstallf\fR inherits the value of the \fBPKG_INSTALL_ROOT\fR environment variable. (See ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, below.) If \fBPKG_INSTALL_ROOT\fR is set, such as when the \fB-R\fR option is used with \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) or \fBpkgrm\fR(1M), there is no need to use the \fBinstallf\fR \fB-R\fR option.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).

\fBExample 1 \fRBasic Usage

The following example shows the use of \fBinstallf\fR, invoked from an optional pre-install or post-install script:

.sp

installf $PKGINST /dev/xt d 755 root sys ||
	exit 2

        echo /dev/xt$i$j=/dev/xt/$i$j
    done
    i=`expr $i + 1`
    [ $i \(mile 9 ] && i="0$i" #add leading zero
done | installf $PKGINST \(mi || exit 2
# finalized installation, create links
installf \fB-f\fR $PKGINST || exit 2

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
\fBinstallf\fR inherits the value of the following environment variable. This variable is set when \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) or \fBpkgrm\fR(1M) is invoked with the \fB-R\fR option.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPKG_INSTALL_ROOT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
If present, defines the full path name of a directory to use as the system's \fBPKG_INSTALL_ROOT\fR path. All product and package information files are then looked for in the directory tree, starting with the specified \fBPKG_INSTALL_ROOT\fR path. If not present, the default system path of \fB/\fR is used.

The \fBinstallf\fR command will create directories, named pipes and special devices on the original invocation. Links are created when \fBinstallf\fR is invoked with the \fB-f\fR option to indicate installation is complete.
.sp
.LP
Links should be specified as \fIpath1\fR\fB=\fR\fIpath2.\fR \fIpath1\fR indicates the destination and \fIpath2\fR indicates the source file.
.sp
.LP
Files installed with \fBinstallf\fR will be placed in the class \fBnone\fR, unless a class is defined with the command. Subsequently, they will be removed when the associated package is deleted. If this file should not be deleted at the same time as the package, be certain to assign it to a class which is ignored at removal time. If special action is required for the file before removal, a class must be defined with the command and an appropriate class action script delivered with the package.
.sp
.LP
When classes are used, \fBinstallf\fR must be used in one of the following forms:
.sp
