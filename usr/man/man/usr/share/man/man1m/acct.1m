.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Accounting software is structured as a set of tools (consisting of both C programs and shell procedures) that can be used to build accounting systems. \fBacctsh\fR(1M) describes the set of shell procedures built on top of the C programs.
.sp
.LP
Connect time accounting is handled by various programs that write records into \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, as described in \fButmpx\fR(4). The programs described in \fBacctcon\fR(1M) convert this file into session and charging records, which are then summarized by \fBacctmerg\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Process accounting is performed by the system kernel. Upon termination of a process, one record per process is written to a file (normally \fB/var/adm/pacct\fR). The programs in \fBacctprc\fR(1M) summarize this data for charging purposes; \fBacctcms\fR(1M) is used to summarize command usage. Current process data may be examined using \fBacctcom\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
Process accounting records and connect time accounting records (or any accounting records in the \fBtacct\fR format described in \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD)) can be merged and summarized into total accounting records by \fBacctmerg\fR (see \fBtacct\fR format in \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD)). \fBprtacct\fR (see \fBacctsh\fR(1M)) is used to format any or all accounting records.
.sp
.LP
\fBacctdisk\fR reads lines that contain user \fBID\fR, login name, and number of disk blocks and converts them to total accounting records that can be merged with other accounting records. \fBacctdisk\fR returns an error if the input file is corrupt or improperly formatted.
.sp
.LP
\fBacctdusg\fR reads its standard input (usually from \fBfind\fR \fB/\fR \fB-\fR\fBprint\fR) and computes disk resource consumption (including indirect blocks) by login.
.sp
.LP
\fBaccton\fR without arguments turns process accounting off. If \fIfilename\fR is given, it must be the name of an existing file, to which the kernel appends process accounting records (see \fBacct\fR(2) and \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD)).
.sp
.LP
\fBacctwtmp\fR writes a \fButmpx\fR(4) record to \fIfilename\fR. The record contains the current time and a string of characters that describe the \fIreason\fR. A record type of \fBACCOUNTING\fR is assigned (see \fButmpx\fR(4)) \fIreason\fR must be a string of 11 or fewer characters, numbers, \fB$\fR, or spaces. For example, the following are suggestions for use in reboot and shutdown procedures, respectively: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
acctwtmp "acctg on" /var/adm/wtmpx
acctwtmp "acctg off" /var/adm/wtmpx
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For each user currently logged on, \fBclosewtmp\fR puts a false \fBDEAD_PROCESS\fR record in the \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR file. \fBrunacct\fR (see \fBrunacct\fR(1M)) uses this false \fBDEAD_PROCESS\fR record so that the connect accounting procedures can track the time used by users logged on before \fBrunacct\fR was invoked.
.sp
.LP
For each user currently logged on, \fBrunacct\fR uses \fButmp2wtmp\fR to create an entry in the file \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, created by \fBrunacct\fR. Entries in \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR enable subsequent invocations of \fBrunacct\fR to account for connect times of users currently logged in.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Places in \fIfilename\fR records consisting of those filenames for which \fBacctdusg\fR charges no one (a potential source for finding users trying to avoid disk charges).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Specifies a password file, \fIfilename\fR. This option is not needed if the password file is \fB/etc/passwd\fR.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
If any of the \fBLC_*\fR variables (\fBLC_TYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_NUMERIC\fR, and \fBLC_MONETARY\fR) (see \fBenviron\fR(5)) are not set in the environment, the operational behavior of \fBacct\fR for each corresponding locale category is determined by the value of the \fBLANG\fR environment variable. If \fBLC_ALL\fR is set, its contents are used to override both the \fBLANG\fR and the other \fBLC_*\fR variables. If none of the above variables are set in the environment, the "C" (U.S. style) locale determines how \fBacct\fR behaves.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLC_CTYPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Determines how \fBacct\fR handles characters. When \fBLC_CTYPE\fR is set to a valid value, \fBacct\fR can display and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale. \fBacct\fR can display and handle Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters where any  character can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes wide. \fBacct\fR can also handle EUC characters of 1, 2, or more column widths. In the "C" locale, only characters from ISO 8859-1 are valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLC_TIME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Determines how \fBacct\fR handles date and time formats. In the "C" locale, date and time handling follows the U.S. rules.
