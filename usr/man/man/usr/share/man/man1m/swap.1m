.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBswap\fR utility provides a method of adding, deleting, and monitoring the system swap areas used by the memory manager.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIswapname\fR [\fIswaplow\fR] [\fIswaplen\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add the specified swap area. This option can only be used by the superuser or by one who has assumed the Primary Administrator role. \fIswapname\fR is the name of the swap area or regular file. For example, on system running a UFS root file system, specify a slice, such as \fB/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1\fR, or a regular file for a swap area. On a system running a ZFS file system, specify a ZFS volume, such as \fB/dev/zvol/dsk/rpool/swap\fR, for a swap area. Using a regular file for swap is not supported on a ZFS file system. In addition, you cannot use the same ZFS volume for both the swap area and a dump device when the system is running a ZFS root file system.
.sp
\fIswaplow\fR is the offset in 512-byte blocks into the file where the swap area should begin. \fIswaplen\fR is the desired length of the swap area in 512-byte blocks. The value of \fIswaplen\fR can not be less than \fB16\fR. For example, if \fIn\fR blocks are specified, then (\fIn\fR-1) blocks would be the actual swap length. \fIswaplen\fR must be at least one page in length. The size of a page of memory can be determined by using the \fBpagesize\fR command. See \fBpagesize\fR(1). Since the first page of a swap file is automatically skipped, and a swap file needs to be at least one page in length, the minimum size should be a multiple of 2 pagesize bytes. The size of a page of memory is machine-dependent.
.sp
\fIswaplow\fR + \fIswaplen\fR must be less than or equal to the size of the swap file. If \fIswaplen\fR is not specified, an area will be added starting at \fIswaplow\fR and extending to the end of the designated file. If neither \fIswaplow\fR nor \fIswaplen\fR are specified, the whole file will be used except for the first page. Swap areas are normally added automatically during system startup by the \fB/usr/sbin/swapadd\fR script. This script adds all swap areas which have been specified in the \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file; for the syntax of these specifications, see \fBvfstab\fR(4).
.sp
You can encrypt a ZFS volume used as a swap device by specifying the \fBencrypted\fR option in \fBvfstab\fR(4) and specifying the \fBencryption\fR property for the ZFS volume. See \fBzfs\fR(1M).
.sp
To use an \fBNFS\fR or local file system \fIswapname\fR, you should first create a file using \fBmkfile\fR(1M). A local file system swap file can now be added to the running system by just running the \fBswap\fR \fB-a\fR command. For \fBNFS\fR mounted swap files, the server needs to export the file. Do this by performing the following steps:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Add the following line to \fB/etc/dfs/dfstab\fR: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
share -F nfs -o \e
rw=\fIclientname\fR,root=\fIclientname path-to-swap-file\fR
.fi
.in -2

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Run \fBshareall\fR(1M).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Have the client add the following line to \fB/etc/vfstab\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIserver\fR:\fIpath-to-swap-file\fR -  \fIlocal-path-to-swap-file\fR nfs \e
     -\|-\|- \fIlocal-path-to-swap-file\fR -\|- swap -\|-\|-
.fi
.in -2

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
Have the client run \fBmount\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# mount \fIlocal-path-to-swap-file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
The client can then run \fBswap\fR \fB-a\fR to add the swap space:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# swap -a \fIlocal-path-to-swap-file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

\fB\fB-d\fR \fIswapname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Delete the specified swap area. This option can only be used by the super-user. \fIswapname\fR is the name of the swap file: for example, \fB/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1\fR or a regular file. \fIswaplow\fR is the offset in 512-byte blocks into the swap area to be deleted. If \fIswaplow\fR is not specified, the area will be deleted starting at the second page. When the command completes, swap blocks can no longer be allocated from this area and all swap blocks previously in use in this swap area have been moved to other swap areas.

The list does not include swap space in the form of physical memory because this space is not associated with a particular swap area.
.sp
If \fBswap\fR \fB-l\fR is run while \fIswapname\fR is in the process of being deleted (by \fBswap\fR\fB-d\fR), the string \fBINDEL\fR will appear in a sixth column of the swap stats.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
On the 32-bit operating system, only the first 2 Gbytes -1 are used for swap devices greater than or equal to 2 Gbytes in size. On the 64-bit operating system, a block device larger than 2 Gbytes can be fully utilized for swap up to 2^63 \(mi1 bytes.
