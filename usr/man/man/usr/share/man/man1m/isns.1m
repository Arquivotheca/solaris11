.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

\fB/usr/sbin/isns\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides consolidated discovery services for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) devices in an IP network.  iSNS uses a client/server mechanism: servers store configuration  information for clients, and provide that information upon a client's request. IETF RFC  4171 describes the protocols between the server and client.
.sp
.LP
This man page provides a summary of the Solaris iSNS server implementation. The current implementation does not support iFCP devices.
.sp
.LP
Solaris iSNS server is implemented as the daemon \fBisns\fR, which binds to the well -known port 3205 to service client requests. The daemon is started by the service management facility (\fBsmf\fR(5)), using the fault management resource identifier (FMRI):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/isns_server
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Use \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) to enable \fBisns\fR. Enabling the service means that it starts and runs automatically whenever the operating system is booted. The state of service can be displayed with the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
The service properties listed below can be managed using \fBsvccfg\fR(1M). The default value is assigned per RFC 4171 and implementation choice.

After changing a property value, you must use \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) \fBrefresh\fR to enable \fBisns\fR to recognize the new value. If you change the \fBdata_store_location\fR property, you must enter a \fBsvcadm restart\fR command for the change to take effect.

.LP
RFC 4171 defines the default discovery domain, the default domain set, and the "Default DD/DDS" setting with the intent of managing clients that have not been assigned to any user-defined discovery domain. The server adopts the following behaviors with respect to the default discovery domain and domain set:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An unassigned client is added to the default discovery domain. A newly registered client or a client that was removed from its last discovery domain membership is considered to be an unassigned client.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When a client gets assigned to a user-defined discovery domain, the server will remove the client from the default discovery domain.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The default discovery domain set is allowed to be administratively activated or deactivated in order to let the administrator control discovery among clients in the default discovery domain.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
It is not allowed to administratively add a client to the default discovery domain, nor to administratively add a user-defined discovery domain to the default discovery domain set.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu

The default state of the Default discovery domain set is inactive.

The \fBisns\fR server supports certain \fBrbac\fR(5) authorizations that allow you to administer \fBisns\fR activity. These authorizations include the following \fBauth_attr\fR(4) privileges:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsolaris.isnsmgr.write\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Required to create a discovery domain or domain set, to enable/disable a discovery domain set and to change grouping of iSNS  clients in a discovery domain or grouping of discovery domains in a discovery domain set.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
It is strongly recommended that you restart the server (\fBsvcadm restart\fR) after a service property is changed. This allows the server to apply a uniform setting for existing and new clients.
.sp
.LP
A control node, as described in RFC 4171, is not required to administer the server. Control node operations can be achieved through the \fBisnsadm\fR(1M) command interface on the local host. For example, \fBisnsadm\fR enables you to create a discovery domain and a discovery domain set and to add a member to it, in order to create discovery domain and discovery domain set associations.
