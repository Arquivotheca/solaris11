.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrcapadm\fR

.LP
.nf
\fBrcapadm\fR [ [\fB-n\fR] \fB-E\fR | \fB-D\fR] 
     [\fB-i\fR \fIinterval=value\fR,...,\fIinterval=value\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIpercent\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrcapadm\fR command allows a user with the privileges described below to configure various attributes of the resource capping daemon. If used without arguments, \fBrcapadm\fR displays the current status of the resource capping daemon if it has been configured. See \fBrcapd\fR(1M) for more information. 
.sp
.LP
In the current release of the Solaris operating environment, \fBrcapadm\fR is available to users with all privileges and to users who have the Process Management profile in their list of profiles. The System Administrator role includes the Process Management profile.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIpercent\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the minimum physical memory utilization for memory cap enforcement. Caps will not be enforced until the physical memory available to processes is low. The \fIpercent\fR value should be in the range 0 to 100. The minimum (and default) value is \fB0\fR, which means that memory caps are always enforced.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disable the resource capping daemon so that it will not be started when the system is booted. Also stop the resource capping daemon now, if the \fB-n\fR option is not specified and it is currently running.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable the resource capping daemon so that it will be started each time the system is booted. Also start the resource capping daemon now, if the \fB-n\fR option is not specified and it is not currently running.

\fB\fB-i\fR \fIinterval=value\fR,...,\fIinterval=value\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set intervals for various periodic operations performed by \fBrcapd\fR. All intervals are specified in seconds. You can set the following intervals:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBscan\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The interval at which \fBrcapd\fR scans for new processes. The default scan interval is every 15 seconds. The minimum value is 1 second.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsample\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The interval of process resident set size sampling. The default sample interval is every 5 seconds. The minimum value is 1 second.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBreport\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The interval at which various paging statistics are updated by \fBrcapd\fR, in seconds. These statistics can be viewed by using \fBrcapstat\fR(1SRM). The default reporting interval is every 5 seconds. When the interval is set to \fB0\fR, statistics will not be updated.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
Paging refers to the act of relocating portions of memory, called pages, to or from physical memory. \fBrcapd\fR pages out the most infrequently used pages.
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBconfig\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The reconfiguration interval, in seconds. At each reconfiguration event, \fBrcapd\fR checks its configuration file for updates, and scans the project databases for new project caps. The default reconfiguration interval is every 60 seconds. The minimum interval is \fB0\fR. When the interval is set to \fB0\fR, no periodic reconfiguration occurs, although the running daemon can still be reconfigured by sending it \fBSIGHUP\fR.

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImaxvalue\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Used in conjunction with the \fB-z\fR option. Specifies a value for \fBrcap.max-rss\fR, a dynamically-set cap on the usage of physical memory for the zone specified by \fB-z\fR. You can apply a scale (\fBK\fR, \fBM\fR, \fBG\fR, \fBT\fR) to the value you specify. \fBK\fR means kilobyte; \fBM\fR, megabyte; \fBG\fR, gigabyte; and \fBT\fR, terabyte. For example, \fB100M\fR is 100 megabytes.
.sp
To remove an existing cap, specify \fB0M\fR.

.RS 4n
Do not affect the running state of the resource capping daemon when enabling or disabling it.

\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzonename\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Used in conjunction with the \fB-m\fR option. Specifies the zone for which you are dynamically specifying a cap on physical memory usage (using \fB-m\fR).
.RE

.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
To set a persistent cap on memory usage within a zone, use \fBzonecfg\fR(1M).

\fBExample 2 \fRSpecifying a Resource Cap for a Zone
.sp
