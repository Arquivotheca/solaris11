.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBbart\fR(1M) is a tool that performs a file-level check of the software contents of a system.
.sp
.LP
You can also specify the files to track and the types of discrepancies to flag by means of a rules file, \fBbart_rules\fR. See \fBbart_rules\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
The \fBbart\fR utility performs two basic functions:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbart create\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
The manifest generator tool takes a file-level \fBsnapshot\fR of a system. The output is a catalog of file attributes referred to as a \fBmanifest\fR. See \fBbart_manifest\fR(4).
.sp
You can specify that the list of files be cataloged in three ways. Use \fBbart create\fR with no options, specify the files by name on the command line, or create a rules file with directives that specify which the files to monitor. See \fBbart_rules\fR(4).
.sp
By default, the manifest generator catalogs all attributes of all files in the root (\fB/\fR) file system. File systems mounted on the root file system are cataloged only if they are of the same type as the root file system.
.sp
For example, \fB/\fR, \fB/usr\fR, and \fB/opt\fR are separate UFS file systems. \fB/usr\fR and \fB/opt\fR are mounted on \fB/\fR. Therefore, all three file systems are cataloged. However, \fB/tmp\fR, also mounted on \fB/\fR, is not cataloged because it is a TMPFS file system. Mounted CD-ROMs are not cataloged since they are HSFS file systems.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbart compare\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
The report tool compares two manifests. The output is a list of per-file attribute discrepancies. These discrepancies are the differences between two manifests: a control manifest and a test manifest. 
.sp
A discrepancy is a change to any attribute for a given file cataloged by both manifests. A new file or a deleted file in a manifest is reported as a discrepancy.
.sp
The reporting mechanism provides two types of output: verbose and programmatic. Verbose output is localized and presented on multiple lines, while programmatic output is more easily parsable by other programs. See \fBOUTPUT\fR.
.sp
By default, the report tool generates verbose output where all discrepancies are reported except for modified directory timestamps (\fBdirmtime\fR attribute).
.sp
To ensure consistent and accurate comparison results, \fIcontrol-manifest\fR and \fItest-manifest\fR must be built with the same rules file.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Use the rules file to ignore specified files or subtrees when you generate a manifest or compare two manifests. Users can compare manifests from different perspectives by re-running the \fBbart compare\fR command with different rules files.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIattribute\fR ...\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify the file attributes to be ignored globally. Specify attributes as a comma separated list. 
.sp
This option produces the same behavior as supplying the file attributes to a global \fBIGNORE\fR keyword in the rules file. See \fBbart_rules\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-I\fR [\fIfile_name\fR...]\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify the input list of files. The file list can be specified at the command line or read from standard input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Prevent computation of content signatures for all regular files in the file list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Display manifest comparison output in ``programmatic mode,'' which is suitable for programmatic parsing. The output is not localized.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIrules_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Use \fIrules_file\fR to specify which files and directories to catalog, and to define which file attribute discrepancies to flag. If \fIrules_file\fR is \fB-\fR, then the rules are read from standard input. See \fBbart_rules\fR(4) for the definition of the syntax.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot_directory\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify the root directory for the manifest. All paths specified by the rules, and all paths reported in the manifest, are relative to \fIroot_directory\fR.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR [ \fIhash\fR ]\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify the cryptographic digest algorithm to use for the hash of the file contents: \fBmd5\fR, \fBsha1\fR, \fBsha256\fR, \fBsha512\fR are the currently supported values. If \fB-a\fR is not specified, \fBsha256\fR is used and a Version 1.1 manifest is created that indicates which hash algorithm is used. If \fBmd5\fR is specified then a Version 1.0 manifest is created.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
bart allows quoting of operands. This is particularly important for white-space appearing in subtree and subtree modifier specifications.
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcontrol-manifest\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specify the manifest created by \fBbart create\fR on the control system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItest-manifest\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specify the manifest created by \fBbart create\fR on the test system.
.RE

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
.LP
The \fBbart create\fR and \fBbart compare\fR commands write output to standard output, and write error messages to standard error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbart create\fR command generates a system manifest. See \fBbart_manifest\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
When the \fBbart compare\fR command compares two system manifests, it generates a list of file differences. By default, the comparison output is localized. However, if the \fB-p\fR option is specified, the output is generated in a form that is suitable for programmatic manipulation.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The file attributes of certain system libraries can be temporarily altered by the system as it boots. To avoid triggering false warnings, you should compare manifests only if they were both created with the system in the same state; that is, if both were created in single-user or both in multi-user.
