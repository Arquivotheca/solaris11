.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsck\fR utility audits and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions on file systems. A file system to be checked may be specified by giving the name of the block or character \fIspecial\fR device or by giving the name of its mount point if a matching entry exists in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspecial\fR parameter represents the character special device, for example, \fB/dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s7\fR, on which the file system resides. The character special device, not the block special device should be used. The \fBfsck\fR utility will not work if the block device is mounted, unless the file system is error-locked.
.sp
.LP
If no \fIspecial\fR device is specified, all \fBufs\fR file systems specified in the \fBvfstab\fR with a \fBfsckdev\fR entry will be checked. If the \fB-p\fR (``preen'') option is specified, \fBufs\fR file systems with an \fBfsckpass\fR number greater than \fB1\fR are checked in parallel. See \fBfsck\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
In the case of correcting serious inconsistencies, by default, \fBfsck\fR asks for confirmation before making a repair and waits for the operator to respond either \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. If the operator does not have write permission on the file system, \fBfsck\fR will default to a \fB-n\fR (no corrections) action. See \fBfsck\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Repairing some file system inconsistencies can result in loss of data. The amount and severity of data loss can be determined from the diagnostic output.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsck\fR utility automatically corrects innocuous inconsistencies such as unreferenced inodes, too-large link counts in inodes, missing blocks in the free list, blocks appearing in the free list and also in files, or incorrect counts in the super block. It displays a message for each inconsistency corrected that identifies the nature of the correction on the file system which took place. After successfully correcting a file system, \fBfsck\fR prints the number of files on that file system, the number of used and free blocks, and the percentage of fragmentation.

.LP
Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are, with the operator's concurrence, reconnected by placing them in the \fBlost+found\fR directory. The name assigned is the inode number. If the \fBlost+found\fR directory does not exist, it is created. If there is insufficient space in the \fBlost+found\fR directory, its size is increased.
.sp
.LP
An attempt to mount a \fBufs\fR file system with the \fB\fR\fB-o\fR\fB nolargefiles\fR option will fail if the file system has ever contained a large file (a file whose size is greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte). Invoking \fBfsck\fR resets the file system state if no large files are present in the file system. A successful mount of the file system after invoking \fBfsck\fR indicates the absence of large files in the file system. An unsuccessful mount attempt indicates the presence of at least one large file. See \fBmount_ufs\fR(1M).
.SH OPTIONS

The \fIgeneric-options\fR consist of the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Check but do not repair. This option checks that the file system is suitable for mounting, returning the appropriate exit status. If the file system is ready for mounting, \fBfsck\fR displays a message such as: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na

.ad
.sp .6

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The operating system buffers file system data. Running \fBfsck\fR on a mounted file system can cause the operating system's buffers to become out of date with respect to the disk. For this reason, the file system should be \fIunmounted\fR when \fBfsck\fR is used. If this is not possible, care should be taken that the system is quiescent and that it is rebooted immediately after \fBfsck\fR is run. Quite often, however, this will not be sufficient. A panic will probably occur if running \fBfsck\fR on a file system modifies the file system.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
It is usually faster to check the character special device than the block special device.
.sp
.LP
Running \fBfsck\fR on file systems larger than 2 Gb fails if the user chooses to use the block interface to the device:
