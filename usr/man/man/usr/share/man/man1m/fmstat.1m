.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfmstat\fR utility can be used by administrators and service personnel to report statistics associated with the Solaris Fault Manager, \fBfmd\fR(1M) and its associated set of modules. The Fault Manager runs in the background on each Solaris system. It receives telemetry information relating to problems detected by the system software, diagnoses these problems, and initiates proactive self-healing activities such as disabling faulty components.
.sp
.LP
You can use \fBfmstat\fR to view statistics for diagnosis engines and agents that are currently participating in fault management. The documentation for \fBfmd\fR(1M), \fBfmadm\fR(1M), and \fBfmdump\fR(1M) describes more about tools to observe fault management activities. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR option is present or the \fB-t\fR option is present, \fBfmstat\fR reports any statistics kept by the specified fault management module. The module list can be obtained using \fBfmadm config\fR. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR option is not present, \fBfmstat\fR reports the following statistics for each of its client modules: 
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBmodule\fR\fR

The \fBfmstat\fR utility requires the user to posses the \fBSYS_ADMIN\fR privilege. Refer to the \fISystem Administration Guide: Security Services\fR for more information about how to configure Solaris privileges.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Print all statistics for a module, including those kept on its behalf by \fBfmd\fR. If the \fB-a\fR option is not present, only those statistics kept by the module are reported. If the \fB-a\fR option is used without the \fB-m\fR \fImodule\fR, a set of global statistics associated with \fBfmd\fR are displayed. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fBu\fR | \fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Display a time stamp.
.sp
Specify \fBu\fR for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See \fBtime\fR(2). Specify \fBd\fR for standard date format. See \fBdate\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImodule\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Print a report on the statistics associated with the specified fault management module, instead of the default statistics report. Modules can publish an arbitrary set of statistics to help Sun service the fault management software itself. The module statistics constitute a Private interface. See \fBattributes\fR(5) for information on Sun's rules for Private interfaces. Scripts should not be written that depend upon the values of fault management module statistics as they can change without notice.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Print a report on Soft Error Rate Discrimination (SERD) engines associated with the module instead of the default module statistics report. A SERD engine is a construct used by fault management software to determine if a statistical threshold measured as \fIN\fR events in some time \fIT\fR has been exceeded. The \fB-s\fR option can only be used in combination with the \fB-m\fR option. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Print a report on the statistics associated with each fault management event transport. Each fault management module can provide the implementation of one or more event transports. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Print a table of the authority information associated with each fault management event transport. If the \fB-m\fR option is present, only transports associated with the specified module are displayed. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Omit statistics with a zero value from the report associated with the specified fault management module. The \fB-z\fR option can only be used in combination with the \fB-m\fR option. 
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP

.na
\fB\fIinterval\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Print a new report every \fIinterval\fR seconds.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If no \fIinterval\fR and no \fIcount\fR are specified, a single report is printed and \fBfmstat\fR exits. If an \fIinterval\fR is specified but no \fIcount\fR is specified, \fBfmstat\fR prints reports every \fIinterval\fR seconds indefinitely until the command is interrupted.
.SH EXIT STATUS
