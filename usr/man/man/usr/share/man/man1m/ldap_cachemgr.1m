.SH NAME
ldap_cachemgr \- LDAP daemon to manage client configuration for LDAP based Network Information Service lookups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/ldap/ldap_cachemgr\fR [\fB-l\fR \fIlog-file\fR] [\fB-g\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR daemon is a process that provides an up-to-date configuration cache for LDAP naming services. It is started during multi-user boot.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR utility provides caching for all parameters as specified and used by the LDAP naming service clients. The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR utility uses the cache files which are originally created by executing the \fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility, as cold start files. Updates to the cache files take place dynamically if profiles are used to configure the client. See the \fBinit\fR option to \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR utility helps improve the performance of the clients that are using LDAP as the Naming service repository. In order for the LDAP naming services to function properly, the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR daemon must be running. \fBldap_cachemgr\fR also improves system security by making the configuration files readable by superuser only.
.sp
.LP
The cache maintained by this daemon is shared by all the processes that access LDAP Naming information. All processes access this cache through a door call. On startup, \fBldap_cachemgr\fR initializes the cache from the cache files. See \fBldapclient\fR(1M). Thus, the cache survives machine reboots.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldap_cachemgr\fR daemon also acts as its own administration tool. If an instance of \fBldap_cachemgr\fR is already running, commands are passed transparently to the running version.
