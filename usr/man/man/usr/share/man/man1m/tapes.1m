.SH NAME
tapes \- creates /dev entries for tape drives attached to the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/tapes\fR [\fB-r\fR \fIroot_dir\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdevfsadm\fR(1M) is now the preferred command for \fB/dev\fR and \fB/devices\fR and should be used instead of \fBtapes\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBtapes\fR creates symbolic links in the \fB/dev/rmt\fR directory to the actual tape device special files under the \fB/devices\fR directory tree. \fBtapes\fR searches the kernel device tree to see what tape devices are attached to the system. For each equipped tape drive, the following steps are performed:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The \fB/dev/rmt\fR directory is searched for a \fB/dev/rmt/\fR\fIn\fR entry that is a symbolic link to the \fB/devices\fR special node of the current tape drive. If one is found, this determines the logical controller number of the tape drive.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
The rest of the special devices associated with the drive are checked, and incorrect symbolic links are removed and necessary ones added.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
If none are found, a new logical controller number is assigned (the lowest-unused number), and new symbolic links are created for all the special devices associated with the drive.
.RE
.sp
.LP
\fBtapes\fR does not remove links to non-existent devices; these must be removed by hand.
.sp
.LP
\fBtapes\fR is run each time a reconfiguration-boot is performed, or when \fBadd_drv\fR(1M) is executed.
.SS "Notice to Driver Writers"
.sp
.LP
\fBtapes\fR(1M) considers all devices with the node type \fBDDI_NT_TAPE\fR to be tape devices; these devices must have their minor name created with a specific format. The minor name encodes operational modes for the tape device and consists of an \fBASCII\fR string of the form [ \fBl\fR,\fBm\fR,\fBh\fR,\fBc\fR,\fBu\fR ][ \fBb\fR ][ \fBn\fR ].
.sp
.LP
The first character set is used to specify the tape density of the device, and are named low (\fBl\fR), medium (\fBm\fR), high (\fBh\fR), compressed (\fBc\fR), and ultra (\fBu\fR). These specifiers only express a relative density; it is up to the driver to assign specific meanings as needed. For example, 9 track tape devices interpret these as actual bits-per-inch densities, where \fBl\fR means 800 \fBBPI,\fR \fBm\fR means 1600 \fBBPI ,\fR and \fBh\fR means 6250 \fBBPI,\fR whereas 4mm \fBDAT\fR tapes defines \fBl\fR as standard format, and \fBm\fR, \fB h\fR, \fBc\fR and \fBu\fR as compressed format. Drivers may choose to implement any or all of these format types.
.sp
.LP
During normal tape operation (non-\fBBSD\fR behavior), once an \fBEOF\fR mark has been reached, subsequent reads from the tape device return an error. An explicit IOCTL must be issued to space over the \fBEOF\fR mark before the next file can be read. \fBb\fR instructs the device to observe \fBBSD\fR behavior, where reading at \fBEOF\fR will cause the tape device to automatically space over the \fBEOF\fR mark and begin reading from the next file.
.sp
.LP
\fBn\fR or no-rewind-on-close instructs the driver to not rewind to the beginning of tape when the device is closed. Normal behavior for tape devices is to reposition to BOT when closing. See \fBmtio\fR(7I).
.sp
.LP
The minor number for tape devices should be created by encoding the device's instance number using the tape macro \fBMTMINOR\fR and ORing in the proper combination of density, \fBBSD\fR behavior, and no-rewind flags. See \fBmtio\fR(7I).
.sp
.LP
To prevent \fBtapes\fR from attempting to automatically generate links for a device, drivers must specify a private node type and refrain from using the node type string \fBDDI_NT_TAPE\fR when calling\fBddi_create_minor_node\fR(9F).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIroot_dir\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Causes \fBtapes\fR to presume that the \fB/dev/rmt\fR directory tree is found under \fIroot_dir\fR, not directly under \fB/\fR.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
If \fBtapes\fR finds entries of a particular logical controller linked to different physical controllers, it prints an error message and exits without making any changes to the \fB/dev\fR directory, since it cannot determine which of the two alternative logical to physical mappings is correct. The links should be manually corrected or removed before another reconfiguration boot is performed.
.SH EXAMPLES

Installing the \fBxktape\fR driver on a Sun Fire 4800, with the driver controlling a \fBSCSI\fR tape (target 4 attached to an \fBisp\fR(7D) \fBSCSI HBA)\fR and performing a reconfiguration-boot creates the following special files in \fB/devices\fR.
