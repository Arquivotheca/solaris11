.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBkadmind\fR runs on the master key distribution center (\fBKDC\fR), which stores the principal and policy databases. \fBkadmind\fR accepts remote requests to administer the information in these databases. Remote requests are sent, for example, by \fBkpasswd\fR(1), \fBgkadmin\fR(1M), and \fBkadmin\fR(1M) commands, all of which are clients of \fBkadmind\fR. When you install a \fBKDC\fR, \fBkadmind\fR is set up in the \fBinit\fR scripts to start automatically when the \fBKDC\fR is rebooted.
.sp
.LP
\fBkadmind\fR requires a number of configuration files to be set up for it to work: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/etc/krb5/kdc.conf\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBKDC\fR configuration file contains configuration information for the \fBKDC\fR and the Kerberos administration system. \fBkadmind\fR understands a number of configuration variables (called relations) in this file, some of which are mandatory and some of which are optional. In particular, \fBkadmind\fR uses the \fBacl_file\fR, \fBdict_file\fR, \fBadmin_keytab\fR, and \fBkadmind_port\fR relations in the [\fIrealms\fR] section. Refer to the \fBkdc.conf\fR(4) man page for information regarding the format of the \fBKDC\fR configuration file.

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/etc/krb5/kadm5.keytab\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fBkadmind\fR requires a \fBkeytab\fR (key table) containing correct entries for the \fBkadmin\fR/\fIfqdn\fR, \fBkadmin\fR/\fBchangepw\fR and \fBkadmin\fR/\fBchangepw\fR principals for every realm that \fBkadmind\fR answers requests. The \fBkeytab\fR can be created with the \fBkadmin.local\fR(1M) or \fBkdb5_util\fR(1M) command. The location of the keytab is determined by the \fBadmin_keytab\fR relation in the \fBkdc.conf\fR(4) file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/etc/krb5/kadm5.acl\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fBkadmind\fR uses an \fBACL\fR (access control list) to determine which principals are allowed to perform Kerberos administration actions. The path of the \fBACL\fR file is determined by the \fBacl_file\fR relation in the \fBkdc.conf\fR file. See \fBkdc.conf\fR(4). For information regarding the format of the \fBACL\fR file, refer to \fBkadm5.acl\fR(4).
.sp
The \fBkadmind\fR daemon will need to be restarted to reread the \fBkadm5.acl\fR file after it has been modified. You can do this, as root, with the following command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# svcadm restart svc:/network/security/kadmin:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
After \fBkadmind\fR begins running, it puts itself in the background and disassociates itself from its controlling terminal.
.sp
.LP
\fBkadmind\fR can be configured for incremental database propagation. Incremental propagation allows slave KDC servers to receive principal and policy updates incrementally instead of receiving full dumps of the database. These settings can be changed in the \fBkdc.conf\fR(4) file:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsunw_dbprop_enable = [true | false]\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable or disable incremental database propagation. Default is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsunw_dbprop_master_ulogsize = N\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum amount of log entries available for incremental propagation to the slave KDC servers. The maximum value that this can be is 2500 entries. Default value is 1000 entries.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBkiprop/\fR\fI<hostname>\fR\fB@\fR\fI<REALM>\fR principal must exist in the master's \fBkadm5.keytab\fR file to enable the slave to authenticate incremental propagation from the master. In the principal syntax above, \fI<hostname>\fR is the master KDC's host name and \fI<REALM>\fR is the realm in which the master KDC resides.
.sp
.LP
Kerberos client machines can automatically migrate Unix users to the default Kerberos realm specified in the local \fBkrb5.conf\fR(4), if the user does not have a valid kerberos account already. You achieve this by using the \fBpam_krb5_migrate\fR(5) service module for the service in question. The Kerberos service principal used by the client machine attempting the migration needs to be validated using the \fBu\fR privilege in \fBkadm5.acl\fR(4). When using the \fBu\fR privilege, \fBkadmind\fR validates user passwords using PAM, specifically using a \fBPAM_SERVICE\fR name of \fBk5migrate\fR by calling \fBpam_authenticate\fR(3PAM) and \fBpam_acct_mgmt\fR(3PAM).
.sp
.LP
A suitable PAM stack configuration example for \fBk5migrate\fR would look like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
k5migrate        auth    required        pam_unix_auth.so.1
k5migrate        account required        pam_unix_account.so.1

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-nofork\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies that \fBkadmind\fR does not put itself in the background and does not disassociate itself from the terminal. In normal operation, you should use the default behavior, which is to allow the daemon to put itself in the background. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies that the master database password should be retrieved from the keyboard rather than from the stash file. When using \fB-m\fR, the \fBkadmind\fR daemon receives the password prior to putting itself in the background. If used in combination with the \fB-d\fR option, you must explicitly place the daemon in the background.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-port\fR \fIport-number\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the port on which the \fBkadmind\fR daemon listens for connections. The default is controlled by the \fBkadmind_port\fR relation in the \fBkdc.conf\fR(4) file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIpid_file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the file to which the PID of \fBkadmind\fR process should be written to after it starts up. This can be used to identify whether \fBkadmind\fR is still running and to allow \fBinit\fR scripts to stop the correct process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIrealm\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the default realm that \fBkadmind\fR serves. If \fIrealm\fR is not specified, the default \fIrealm\fR of the host is used. \fBkadmind\fR answers requests for any realm that exists in the local \fBKDC\fR database and for which the appropriate principals are in its \fBkeytab\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The Kerberos administration daemon (\fBkadmind\fR) is now compliant with the change-password standard mentioned in RFC 3244, which means it can now handle change-password requests from non-Solaris Kerberos clients.
.sp
.LP
The \fBkadmind\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/security/kadmin
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-d\fR and \fB-p\fR arguments are made obsolete with the \fB-nofork\fR and \fB-port\fR arguments, respectively. The \fB-d\fR and \fB-p\fR arguments might be removed in a future release of the Solaris operating system.
