.SH NAME
metadevadm \- update metadevice information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/metadevadm\fR [\fB-h\fR] [\fB-n\fR] [ [\fB-l\fR]\fB-r\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fIsetname\fR] 
     [\fB-u\fR \fIdisk_specifier\fR] [\fB-v\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmetadevadm\fR command facilitates the administration of device ID entries in Solaris Volume Manager. Use this command when the pathname stored in the metadevice state database no longer correctly addresses the device or when a disk drive has had its device ID changed.
.sp
.LP
This command requires root privileges.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Provide a help display.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify that \fBmetadevadm\fR log to \fBsyslog\fR(3C). \fBmetadevadm\fR logs to the \fBDAEMON\fR facility at the \fBERR\fR level by default. See \fBsyslog.conf\fR(4) for additional information on changing logging levels. 
.sp
Use this option anytime. It is most useful in startup scripts and less useful interactively.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Emulate the effect of a command, without making any changes to the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Recompute the pathname and disk specifier (including slice) associated with all devices in the metadevice state database if the device supports device IDs. If a device does not support device IDs or the device is not available, then no action is taken for that device. 
.sp
Use this option when the disk has been moved or readdressed. 
.sp
This option is run automatically at boot time to detect device ID changes and update the state database.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIsetname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify the name of the disk set on which \fBmetadevadm\fR works. This option causes the command to perform its administrative function within the specified disk set. Without this option, the command performs its function on devices in the local disk set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fB\fIdisk_specifier\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Obtain the device ID associated with the \fIdisk_specifier\fR (for example, \fBc1t2d0\fR) of a device and update the metadevice state database. If the device ID has not changed this option does nothing. Use this option when a disk drive has had its device ID changed during a firmware upgrade or due to changing the controller of a storage subsystem.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Execute in verbose mode. This option has no effect when used with \fB-u\fR. Verbose is the default.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUpdating Device ID of Disk
.sp
.LP
The following example updates the device \fBc2t3d0\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -u c2t3d0
Updating SLVM device relocation information for c2t3d0.
Old device reloc information: id19280192391293123012012010012012091398
New device reloc information: id19380192391293123012012010012012091398
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example is a variation of the preceding, using the full pathname.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -u /dev/dsk/c2t3d0
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example uses the \fB-n\fR option, which means that the command is emulated, but does not take effect. Note that when the \fB-v\fR option is used with \fB-u\fR, \fB-v\fR has no effect (verbose is the default).

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -u -v -n c2t3d0
Updating SLVM device relocation information for c2t3d0.
Old device reloc information: id19280192391293123012012010012012091398
New device reloc information: id19380192391293123012012010012012091398

\fBExample 2 \fRRecomputing Pathnames
.sp
.LP
In the following example, all device names are valid.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -r
Disk movement detected.
Updating device names in SLVM.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In the following example, once again device names are valid.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -r -v
Disk movement detected.
Updating device names in SLVM.
c0t0d0s0 changed to c0t0d1s0 from device relocation information

.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In the following example, \fBmetadevadm\fR detects an invalid device name.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metadevadm -r
Invalid device relocation information detected in SLVM.
Please check status of following disk(s):
