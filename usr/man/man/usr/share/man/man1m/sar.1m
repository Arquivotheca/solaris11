.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
System activity data can be accessed at the special request of a user (see \fBsar\fR(1)) and automatically, on a routine basis, as described here. The operating system contains several counters that are incremented as various system actions occur. These include counters for \fBCPU\fR utilization, buffer usage, disk and tape \fBI/O\fR activity, \fBTTY\fR device activity, switching and system-call activity, file-access, queue activity, inter-process communications, and paging. For more general system statistics, use \fBiostat\fR(1M), \fBsar\fR(1), or \fBvmstat\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
\fBsadc\fR and two shell procedures, \fBsa1\fR and \fBsa2\fR, are used to sample, save, and process this data.
.sp
.LP
\fBsadc\fR, the data collector, samples system data \fIn\fR times, with an interval of \fIt\fR seconds between samples, and writes in binary format to \fIofile\fR or to standard output. The sampling interval \fIt\fR should be greater than 5 seconds; otherwise, the activity of \fBsadc\fR itself may affect the sample. If \fIt\fR and \fIn\fR are omitted, a special record is written. This facility can be used at system boot time, when booting to a multi-user state, to mark the time at which the counters restart from zero. For example, when accounting is enabled, the \fBsvc:/system/sar:default\fR service writes the restart mark to the daily data file using the command entry: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
su sys -c "/usr/lib/sa/sadc /var/adm/sa/sa`date +%d`"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The shell script \fBsa1\fR, a variant of \fBsadc\fR, is used to collect and store data in the binary file \fB/var/adm/sa/sa\fR\fIdd,\fR where \fBdd\fR is the current day. The arguments \fIt\fR and \fIn\fR cause records to be written \fIn\fR times at an interval of \fIt\fR seconds, or once if omitted. The following entries in \fB/var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys\fR will produce records every 20 minutes during working hours and hourly otherwise:
.sp

.LP
The shell script \fBsa2\fR, a variant of \fBsar\fR, writes a daily report in the file \fB/var/adm/sa/sar\fR\fIdd.\fR See the \fBOPTIONS\fR section in \fBsar\fR(1) for an explanation of the various options. The following entry in \fB/var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys\fR will report important activities hourly during the working day:
