.SH NAME
in.rexecd, rexecd \- remote execution server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBin.rexecd\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rexecd\fR is the server for the \fBrexec\fR(3SOCKET) routine.  The server provides remote execution facilities with authentication based on user names and passwords. It is invoked automatically as needed by \fBinetd\fR(1M), and then executes the following protocol:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The server reads characters from the socket up to a null (\fB\e0\fR) byte.  The resultant string is interpreted as an \fBASCII\fR number, base 10.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
If the number received in step 1 is non-zero, it is interpreted as the port number of a secondary stream to be used for the \fBstderr\fR. A second connection is then created to the specified port on the client's machine.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
A null terminated password of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
A null terminated command to be passed to a shell is retrieved on the initial socket.  The length of the command is limited by the upper bound on the size of the system's argument list.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
6.
\fBrexecd\fR then validates the user as is done at login time and, if the authentication was successful, changes to the user's home directory, and establishes the user and group protections of the user. If any of these steps fail the connection is aborted and a diagnostic message is returned.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
7.
A null byte is returned on the connection associated with the \fBstderr\fR and the command line is passed to the normal login shell of the user.  The shell inherits the network connections established by \fBrexecd\fR.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
All diagnostic messages are returned on the connection associated with the \fBstderr\fR, after which any network connections are closed. An error is indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1 (0 is returned in step 7 above upon successful completion of all the steps prior to the command execution).
