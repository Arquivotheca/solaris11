.SH NAME
ypinit \- set up NIS client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/ypinit\fR [\fB-c\fR] [\fB-m\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fImaster_server\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBypinit\fR can be used to set up an \fBNIS\fR client system. You must be the superuser to run this command. This script need not be used at all if \fBypbind\fR(1M) is started with the \fB-broadcast\fR option (it is invoked with this option from the \fBsvc:/network/nis/client:default service\fR).
.sp
.LP
Normally, \fBypinit\fR is run only once after installing the system. It may be run whenever a new \fBNIS\fR server is added to the network or an existing one is decommissioned.
.sp
.LP
\fBypinit\fR prompts for a list of \fBNIS\fR servers to bind the client to; this list should be ordered from the closest to the furthest server. It is recommended that you list each of these NIS servers by name and numeric IP address in \fB/etc/hosts\fR. Though the practice is not recommended, NIS allows you to list servers by numeric address only, bypassing \fB/etc/hosts\fR. In such a configuration, \fBypwhich\fR(1) returns a numeric address instead of a name.
.sp
.LP
\fBypinit\fR stores the list of servers to which a client can bind in the file \fB/var/yp/binding/\fIdomain\fR/ypservers\fR. This file is used by \fBypbind\fR when run without the \fB-broadcast\fR option.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBNIS client\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/nis/client:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
\fBypinit\fR sets up the list of \fBNIS\fR servers only for the current domain on the system when it is run, that is, the domain returned by the \fBSI_SRPC_DOMAIN\fR command to \fBsysinfo\fR(2). Care should be taken to ensure that this is the same as the desired domain for \fBNIS\fR client processes.
