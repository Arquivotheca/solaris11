.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgrm\fR will remove a previously installed or partially installed package from the system. A check is made to determine if any other packages depend on the one being removed. If a dependency exists, the action taken is defined in the \fBadmin\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The default state for the command is in interactive mode, meaning that prompt messages are given during processing to allow the administrator to confirm the actions being taken. Non-interactive mode can be requested with the \fB-n\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-s\fR option can be used to specify the directory from which spooled packages should be removed.
.sp
.LP
Certain unbundled and third-party packages are no longer entirely compatible with the latest version of \fBpkgrm\fR. These packages require user interaction throughout the removal and not just at the very beginning.
.sp
.LP
To remove these older packages (released prior to Solaris 2.4), set the following environment variable:\fBNONABI_SCRIPTS=TRUE\fR \fBpkgrm\fR permits keyboard interaction throughout the removal as long as this environment variable is set. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIadmin\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Use the installation administration file, \fBadmin\fR, in place of the default \fBadmin\fR file. \fBpkgrm\fR first looks in the current working directory for the administration file. If the specified administration file is not in the current working directory, \fBpkgrm\fR looks in the \fB/var/sadm/install/admin\fR directory for the administration file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remove the package files from the client's file system, absolutely. If a file is shared with other packages, the default behavior is to not remove the file from the client's file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Instruct \fBpkgrm\fR not to use the \fB$\fR\fIroot_path\fR\fB/etc/vfstab\fR file for determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Non-interactive mode. If there is a need for interaction, the command will exit. 
.sp
Use of this option requires that at least one package instance be named upon invocation of the command. Certain conditions must exist for a package to be removed non-interactively or a non-restrictive \fBadmin\fR file needs to be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot_path\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Defines the full path name of a directory to use as the \fIroot_path\fR. All files, including package system information files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified \fIroot_path\fR.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the \fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIspool\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remove the specified package(s) from the directory \fIspool\fR. The default directory for spooled packages is \fB/var/sadm/pkg\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Trace all of the scripts that get executed by \fBpkgrm\fR, located in the \fIpkginst\fR\fB/install\fR directory. This option is used for debugging the procedural and non-procedural scripts.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-V\fR \fIfs_file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify an alternative \fIfs_file\fR to map the client's file systems. Used in situations where the \fB$\fR\fIroot_path\fR\fB/etc/vfstab\fR file is non-existent or unreliable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-Y\fR \fIcategory\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remove packages based on the value of the \fBCATEGORY\fR parameter stored in the installed or spooled package's \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. No package with the \fBCATEGORY\fR value of \fBsystem\fR can removed from the file system with this option.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpkginst\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the package to be removed. The format \fIpkginst\fR\fB\&.*\fR can be used to remove all instances of a package.
.sp
The asterisk character (\fB*\fR) is a special character to some shells and may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, "\fB*\fR" must be surrounded by single quotes (\fB\&'\fR) or preceded by a backslash (\e).
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRRemoving All Instances of \fBSUNWjunk\fR from \fBclient1\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example removes all instances of \fBSUNWjunk\fR from \fBclient1\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% pkgrm \fB-R\fR /export/root/client1 SUNWjunk*
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Note the caveat on the use of the \fB-R\fR option in the description of that option, above.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a datastream of  up to 4 GB.
