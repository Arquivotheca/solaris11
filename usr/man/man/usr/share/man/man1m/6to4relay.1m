.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB6to4relay\fR command is used to configure 6to4 relay router communication. Relay router communication support is enabled by setting the value of a variable that stores an IPv4 address within the \fBtun\fR module. This variable is global to all tunnels and defines the policy for communication with relay routers. By default, the address is set to \fBINADDR_ANY\fR (\fB0.0.0.0\fR), and the kernel interprets the value to indicate that support for relay router communication is disabled. Otherwise, support is enabled, and the specified address is used as the IPv4 destination address when packets destined for native IPv6 (non-6to4) hosts are sent through the 6to4 tunnel interface. The \fB6to4relay\fR command uses a project private ioctl to set the variable.
.sp
.LP
\fB6to4relay\fR used without any options outputs the current, in-kernel, configuration status. Use the \fB-a\fR option to send packets to a specific relay router's \fBunicast\fR address instead of the default \fBanycast\fR address. The address specified with the \fB-a\fR option does not specify the policy for receiving traffic from relay routers. The source relay router on a received packet is non-deterministic, since a different relay router may be chosen for each sending native IPv6 end-point.
.sp
.LP
Configuration changes made by using the \fB6to4relay\fR are not persistent across reboot. The changes will persist in the kernel only until you take the tunnel down
.SH OPTIONS

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Enable support for relay router. Use \fB-a\fR \fIaddr\fR if it is specified. Otherwise, use the default \fBanycast\fR address, 192.88.99.1.

.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIaddr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt
