.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfssnap\fR command queries, creates, or deletes a temporary snapshot of a \fBUFS\fR file system. A snapshot is a point-in-time image of a file system that provides a stable and unchanging device interface for backups.
.sp
.LP
When creating a file system snapshot, you must specify the file system to be captured and the backing-store file. The backing-store file(s) are where the snapshot subsystem saves old file system data before it is overwritten. Beyond the first backing-store file, \fBfssnap\fR automatically creates additional backing-store files on an as-needed basis.
.sp
.LP
The number and size of the backing store files varies with the amount of activity in the file system. The destination path must have enough free space to hold the backing-store file(s). This location must be different from the file system that is being captured in a snapshot. The backing-store file(s) can reside on any type of file system, including another \fBUFS\fR file system or an \fBNFS\fR-mounted file system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Deletes the snapshot associated with the given file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays the state of one or all \fBUFS\fR snapshots. If a mount-point or device is not specified, a list of all snapshots on the system is displayed. When a mount-point or device is specified, detailed information is provided for the specified file system snapshot by default.
.sp
Use the \fB-o\fR options with the \fB-i\fR option to specify what snapshot information is displayed. Since this feature is provided primarily for use in scripts and on the command line, no labels are displayed for the data. Sizes are all in bytes, and the output is not internationalized or localized. The information is displayed on one line per option. Unrecognized options display a single \fB?\fR on the line. One line per option guarantees that there are the same number of lines as options specified and there is a one-to-one correspondence between an output line and an option.
.sp
The following \fB-o\fR options display specific information for a given snapshot. See the EXAMPLES section for examples of how to use these options.

\fB\fB-o\fR \fIspecific-options\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Without \fB-d\fR or \fB-i\fR, the default action is to create a snapshot. Specify the following options when creating a snapshot. All of these options are discretionary, except for the backing-store file, which is required.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbacking-store=\fR\fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Uses \fIpath\fR in the creation of the backing-store file(s). \fIpath\fR must not reside on the file system that is being captured in a snapshot and must not be the name of an existing file. If \fIpath\fR is a directory, then a backing-store file is created within it using a name that is generated automatically. If \fIpath\fR is not a directory and does not already exist, then a backing-store file with that name is created. If more than one backing-store file is required, \fBfssnap\fR creates subsequent files automatically. The second and subsequent files have the same name as the first file, with suffixes of \fB\&.2\fR, \fB\&.3\fR, and so forth.
.sp
This option can be abbreviated as \fBbf=\fR\fIpath\fR or \fBbs=\fR\fIpath\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBunlink\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unlinks the backing-store file after the snapshot is created. This option specifies that the backing-store file does not need to be removed manually when the snapshot is deleted. This might make administration more difficult since the file is not visible in the file system. If this option is not specified, the backing-store files should be removed manually after the snapshot is deleted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBchunksize=\fR\fIn\fR [\fBk\fR,\fBm\fR,\fBg\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Uses \fIn\fR for the chunk size. Chunk size is the granularity of the data that is sent to the backing store. 
.sp
Specify \fBchunksize\fR in the following units: \fBk\fR for kilobytes, \fBm\fR for megabytes, or \fBg\fR for gigabytes. By default, chunk size is four times the block size of the file system (typically \fB32k\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBmaxsize=\fR\fIn\fR[\fBk\fR,\fBm\fR,\fBg\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Does not allow the sum of the sizes of the backing-store file(s) to exceed \fIn\fR, where \fIn\fR is the unit specified.  The snapshot is deleted automatically when the sum of the sizes of the backing-store file(s) exceeds \fBmaxsize\fR.
.sp
Specify \fBmaxsize\fR in the following units: \fBk\fR for kilobytes, \fBm\fR for megabytes, or \fBg\fR for gigabytes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBraw\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays to standard output the name of the raw device instead of the block device when a snapshot is created. The block device is printed by default (when \fBraw\fR is not specified). This option makes it easier to embed \fBfssnap\fR commands in the command line for commands that require the raw device instead. Both devices are always created. This option affects only the output.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCreating a Snapshot of a File System
.sp
.LP
The following example creates a snapshot of a file system. The block special device created for the snapshot is \fB/dev/fssnap/0\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# fssnap -F ufs -o backing-store=/var/tmp /export/home
/dev/fssnap/0
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRBacking Up a File System Snapshot Without Having To Unmount the File System
.sp
.LP
The following example backs up a file system snapshot without having to unmount the file system. Since \fBufsdump\fR requires the path to a raw device, the \fBraw\fR option is used. The \fB/export/home\fR file system snapshot is removed in the second command.  

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# ufsdump 0uf /dev/rmt/0 `fssnap -F ufs 
      -o raw,bs=/export/snap /export/home`
\fI<output from ufsdump>\fR
# fssnap -F ufs -d /export/home
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRBacking Up a File System
.sp
.LP
When backing up a file system, do not let the backing-store file(s) exceed \fB400\fR \fBMbytes\fR. The second command removes the \fB/export/home\fR file system snapshot. 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# ufsdump 0uf /dev/rmt/0 `fssnap -F ufs
      -o maxsize=400m,backing-store=/export/snap,raw 
      /export/home` 
# fssnap -F ufs -d /export/home 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRPerforming an Incremental Dump of a Snapshot
.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBufsdump\fR to back up a snapshot of \fB/var\fR. Note the use of the \fBN\fR option to \fBufsdump\fR, which writes the name of the device being dumped, rather than the name of the snapshot device, to \fB/etc/dumpdates\fR file. See \fBufsdump\fR(1M) for details on the \fBN\fR flag.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# ufsdump lfNu /dev/rmt/0 /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s2 `fssnap -F ufs 
-o raw,bs=/export/scratch,unlink /var`
.fi
.in -2
.sp

1  /export/home
\fI<output continues>\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 6 \fRMounting a File System Snapshot
.sp
.LP
The following example creates a file system snapshot. After you create a file system snapshot, mount it on \fB/tmp/mount\fR for temporary read-only access.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# fssnap -F ufs -o backing-store=/nfs/server/scratch /export/home
/dev/fssnap/1

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfssnap\fR device files should be treated like a regular disk block or character device.
.sp
.LP
The association between a file system and the snapshot is lost when the snapshot is deleted or the system reboots. Snapshot persistence across reboots is not currently supported.
.sp
.LP
To avoid unnecessary performance impacts, perform the snapshot and system backup when the system is least active.
.sp
.LP
It is not possible to perform a snapshot of a file system if any of  the following conditions are true:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The file system is in use by system accounting
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The file system is used as backing store by an application that uses \fBmlock\fR(3C) to lock its pages. Typically, these are real time applications, such as \fBntpd\fR (delivered in the \fBSUNWntpu\fR package).
.RE
.sp
.LP
These conditions result in \fBfssnap\fR being unable to write lock the file system prior to performing the snapshot.
