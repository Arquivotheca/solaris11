.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.comsat\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBcomsat\fR is the server process which listens for reports of incoming mail and notifies users who have requested to be told when mail arrives. It is invoked as needed by \fBinetd\fR(1M), and times out if inactive for a few minutes.
.sp
.LP
\fBcomsat\fR listens on a datagram port associated with the \fBbiff\fR service specification (see \fBservices\fR(4)) for one line messages of the form
.sp
.LP
\fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fImailbox\fR\fB-\fR\fIoffset\fR
.sp
.LP
If the \fIuser\fR specified is logged in to the system and the associated terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by a \fBbiff y\fR), the \fIoffset\fR is used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file, and the first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are printed on the user's terminal.  Lines which appear to be part of the message header other than the \fBFrom\fR, \fBTo\fR,  \fBDate\fR, or \fBSubject\fR lines are not printed when displaying the message.
