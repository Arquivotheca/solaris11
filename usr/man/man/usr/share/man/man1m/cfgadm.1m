.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgadm\fR command provides configuration administration operations on dynamically reconfigurable hardware resources. These operations include displaying status, (\fB-l\fR), initiating testing, (\fB-t\fR), invoking configuration state changes, (\fB-c\fR), invoking hardware specific functions, (\fB-x\fR), and obtaining configuration administration help messages (\fB-h\fR). Configuration administration is performed at \fBattachment points\fR, which are places where system software supports dynamic reconfiguration of hardware resources during continued operation of Solaris.
.sp
.LP
Configuration administration makes a distinction between hardware resources that are physically present in the machine and hardware resources that are configured and visible to Solaris. The nature of configuration administration functions are hardware specific, and are performed by calling hardware specific libraries.
.sp
.LP
Configuration administration operates on an \fBattachment point\fR. Hardware resources located at attachment points can or can not be physically replaceable during system operation, but are dynamically reconfigurable by way of the configuration administration interfaces. 
.sp
.LP
An attachment point defines two unique elements, which are distinct from the hardware resources that exist beyond the attachment point. The two elements of an attachment point are a \fBreceptacle\fR and an \fBoccupant\fR. Physical insertion or removal of hardware resources occurs at attachment points and results in a receptacle gaining or losing an occupant. Configuration administration supports the physical insertion and removal operations as well as other configuration administration functions at an attachment point.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points have associated state and condition information. The configuration administration interfaces provide control for transitioning attachment point states. A receptacle can exist in one of three states: \fBempty\fR, \fBdisconnected\fR or \fBconnected\fR, while an occupant can exist in one of two states: \fBconfigured\fR or \fBunconfigured\fR.
.sp
.LP
A receptacle can provide the \fBempty\fR state, which is the normal state of a receptacle when the attachment point has no occupants. A receptacle can also provide the \fBdisconnected\fR state if it has the capability of isolating its occupants from normal system access. Typically this state is used for various hardware specific testing prior to bringing the occupant's resources into full use by the system, or as a step in preparing an occupant for physical removal or reconfiguration. A receptacle in the disconnected state isolates its occupant from the system as much as its hardware allows, but can provide access for testing and setup. A receptacle must provide the \fBconnected\fR state, which allows normal access to hardware resources contained on any occupants. The connected state is the normal state of a receptacle that contains an occupant and that is not currently undergoing configuration administration operations.
.sp
.LP
The hardware resources contained on an occupant in the \fBunconfigured\fR state are not represented by normal Solaris data structures and are thus not available for use by Solaris. Operations allowed on an unconfigured occupant are limited to configuration administration operations. The hardware resources of an occupant in the \fBconfigured\fR state are represented by normal Solaris data structures and thus some or all of those hardware resources can be in use by Solaris. All occupants provide both the \fBconfigured\fR and \fBunconfigured\fR states,
.sp
.LP
An attachment point can be in one of five conditions: \fBunknown\fR, \fBok\fR, \fBfailing\fR, \fBfailed\fR, or \fBunusable\fR. An attachment point can enter the system in any condition depending upon results of power-on tests and non-volatile record keeping.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point with an occupant in the \fBconfigured\fR state is in one of four conditions: \fBunknown\fR, \fBok\fR, \fBfailing\fR, or \fBfailed\fR. If the condition is not \fBfailing\fR or \fBfailed\fR an attachment point can change to \fBfailing\fR during the course of operation if a hardware dependent recoverable error threshold is exceeded. If the condition is not \fBfailed\fR an attachment point can change to \fBfailed\fR during operation as a result of an unrecoverable error.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point with an occupant in the \fBunconfigured\fR state can be in any of the defined conditions. The condition of an attachment point with an \fBunconfigured\fR occupant can decay from \fBok\fR to \fBunknown\fR after a machine dependent time threshold. Initiating a test function changes the attachment point's condition to \fBok\fR, \fBfailing\fR or \fBfailed\fR depending on the outcome of the test. An attachment point that does not provide a test function can leave the attachment point in the \fBunknown\fR condition. If a test is interrupted, the attachment point's condition can be set to the previous condition, \fBunknown\fR or \fBfailed\fR. An attachment point in the \fBunknown\fR, \fBok\fR, \fBfailing\fR, or \fBfailed\fR conditions can be re-tested.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point can exist in the \fBunusable\fR condition for a variety of reasons, such as inadequate power or cooling for the receptacle, an occupant that is unidentifiable, unsupported, incorrectly configured, etc. An attachment point in the \fBunusable\fR condition can never be used by the system. It typically remains in this condition until the physical cause is remedied.
.sp
.LP
An attachment point also maintains busy information that indicates when a state change is in progress or the condition is being reevaluated.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points are referred to using hardware specific identifiers (\fIap_id\fRs) that are related to the type and location of the attachment points in the system device hierarchy. An \fIap_id\fR can not be ambiguous, it must identify a single attachment point. Two types of \fIap_id\fR specifications are supported: physical and logical. A physical \fIap_id\fR contains a fully specified pathname, while a logical \fIap_id\fR contains a shorthand notation that identifies an attachment point in a more user-friendly way. 
.sp
.LP
For example, an attachment point representing a system's backplane slot number \fB7\fR could have a physical \fIap_id\fR of \fB/devices/central/fhc/sysctrl:slot7\fR while the logical \fIap_id\fR could be \fBsystem:slot7\fR. Another example, the third receptacle on the second \fBPCI I/O\fR bus on a system could have a logical \fIap_id\fR of \fBpci2:plug3\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Attachment points may also be created dynamically. A dynamic attachment point is named relative to a base attachment point which is present in the system. \fBap_id\fRs for dynamic attachment points consist of a base component followed by two colons (\fB::\fR) and a dynamic component. The base component is the base attachment point \fBap_id\fR. The dynamic component is hardware specific and generated by the corresponding hardware specific library.
.sp
.LP
For example, consider a base attachment point, which represents a \fBSCSI HBA\fR, with the physical \fBap_id\fR \fB/devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,fas@e,8800000:scsi\fR and logical \fBap_id c0\fR . A disk attached to this \fBSCSI HBA\fR could be represented by a dynamic attachment point with logical \fBap_id\fR \fBc0::dsk/c0t0d0\fR where \fBc0\fR is the base component and \fBdsk/c0t0d0\fR is the hardware specific dynamic component. Similarly the physical \fBap_id\fR for this dynamic attachment point would be: \fB/devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,fas@e,8800000:scsi::dsk/c0t0d0\fR 
.sp
.LP
An \fIap_type\fR is a partial form of a logical \fBap_id\fR that can be ambiguous and not specify a particular attachment point. An \fIap_type\fR is a substring of the portion of the logical \fBap_id\fR up to but not including the colon (\fB:\fR) separator. For example, an \fIap_type\fR of \fBpci\fR would show all attachment points whose logical \fIap_id\fRs begin with \fBpci\fR.
.sp
.LP
The use of \fIap_types\fR is discouraged. The new select sub-option to the \fB-s\fR option provides a more general and flexible mechanism for selecting attachment points. See \fBOPTIONS\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgadm\fR command interacts primarily with hardware dependent functions contained in hardware specific libraries and thus its behavior is hardware dependent.
.sp
.LP
For each configuration administration operation a service interruption can be required. Should the completion of the function requested require a noticeable service interruption to interactive users, a prompt is output on the standard error output for confirmation on the standard input before the function is started. Confirmation can be overridden using the \fB-y\fR or \fB-n\fR options to always answer yes or no respectively. Hardware specific options, such as test level, are supplied as sub-options using the \fB-o\fR option.
.sp
.LP
Operations that change the state of the system configuration are audited by the system log daemon \fBsyslogd\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The arguments for this command conform to the \fBgetopt\fR(3C) and \fBgetsubopt\fR(3C) syntax convention.

.RE

State transition functions can fail due to the condition of the attachment point or other hardware dependent considerations. All state change \fIfunction\fRs in the direction of adding resources, \fB(insert,\fR \fBconnect\fR and \fBconfigure)\fR are passed onto the hardware specific library when the attachment point is in the \fBok\fR or \fBunknown\fR condition. All other conditions require the use of the force option to allow these \fIfunction\fRs to be passed on to the hardware specific library.  Attachment point condition does not prevent a hardware specific library being called for related to the removal (\fBremove,\fR \fBdisconnect\fR and \fBunconfigure\fR), of hardware resources from the system. Hardware specific libraries can reject state change \fIfunction\fRs if the attachment point is in the \fBunknown\fR condition.
.sp
The condition of an attachment point is not necessarily changed by the state change functions, however errors during state change operations can change the attachment point condition. An attempt to override a condition and force a state change that would otherwise fail can be made by specifying the force option (\fB-f\fR). Hardware specific safety and integrity checks can prevent the force option from having any effect.

Supplies listing options to the list (\fB-l\fR) command. \fIlisting_options\fR conforms to the \fBgetsubopt\fR(3C) syntax convention. The sub-options are used to specify the attachment point selection criteria ( \fBselect\fR=\fIselect_string\fR), the type of matching desired (\fBmatch\fR=\fImatch_type\fR), order of listing (\fBsort\fR=\fIfield_spec\fR), the data that is displayed (\fBcols=\fR\fIfield_spec\fR and \fBcols2=\fR\fIfield_spec\fR), the column delimiter (\fBdelim=\fR\fIstring\fR) and whether to suppress column headings (\fBnoheadings\fR). 
.sp
When the \fBselect\fR sub-option is specified, only attachment points which match the specified criteria will be listed. The \fBselect\fR sub-option has the following syntax: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cfgadm \fB-s\fR select=attr1(value1):attr2(value2)... 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

where an \fIattr\fR is one of \fBap_id\fR, \fBclass\fR or \fBtype\fR. \fBap_id\fR refers to the logical \fIap_id\fR field, \fBclass\fR refers to attachment point class and \fBtype\fR refers to the type field. \fIvalue1\fR, \fIvalue2\fR, etc. are the corresponding values to be matched. The type of match can be specified by the \fBmatch\fR sub-option as follows: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cfgadm \fB-s\fR match=\fImatch_type\fR,select=attr1(value1)...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

where \fImatch_type\fR can be either \fBexact\fR or \fBpartial\fR. The default value is \fBexact\fR.
.sp
Arguments to the \fBselect\fR sub-option can be quoted to protect them from the shell.
.sp
A \fIfield_spec\fR is one or more \fIdata-field\fRs concatenated using colon (\fB:\fR), as in \fIdata-field\fR:\fIdata-field\fR:\fIdata-field\fR. A \fIdata-field\fR is one of \fBap_id\fR, \fBphysid\fR, \fBr_state\fR, \fBo_state\fR, \fBcondition\fR, \fBtype\fR, \fBbusy\fR, \fBstatus_time\fR, \fBstatus_time_p\fR, \fBclass\fR, and \fBinfo\fR. The \fBap_id\fR field output is the logical name for the attachment point, while the \fBphysid\fR field contains the physical name. The \fBr_state\fR field can be \fBempty\fR, \fBdisconnected\fR or \fBconnected\fR. The \fBo_state\fR field can be \fBconfigured\fR or \fBunconfigured\fR. The \fBbusy\fR field can be either \fBy\fR if the attachment point is busy, or \fBn\fR if it is not. The \fBtype\fR and \fBinfo\fR fields are hardware specific. The \fBstatus_time\fR field provides the time at which either the \fBr_state\fR, \fBo_state\fR, or condition of the attachment point last changed. The \fBstatus_time_p\fR field is a parsable version of the \fBstatus_time\fR field. If an attachment point has an associated class, the \fBclass\fR field lists the class name. If an attachment point does not have an associated class, the \fBclass\fR field lists \fBnone\fR.
.sp
The order of the fields in \fIfield_spec\fR is significant: For the \fBsort\fR sub-option, the first field given is the primary sort key. For the \fBcols\fR and \fBcols2\fR sub-options, the fields are printed in the order requested. The order of sorting on a \fIdata-field\fR can be reversed by placing a minus (\fB\(mi\fR) before the \fIdata-field\fR name within the \fIfield_sec\fR for the \fBsort\fR sub-option. The default value for \fBsort\fR is \fBap_id\fR. The defaults values for \fBcols\fR and \fBcols2\fR depend on whether the \fB-v\fR option is given: Without it \fBcols\fR is \fBap_id:r_state:o_state:condition\fR and \fBcols2\fR is not set. With \fB-v\fR \fBcols\fR is \fBap_id:r_state:o_state:condition:info\fR and \fBcols2\fR is \fBstatus_time:type:busy:physid:\fR. The default value for \fBdelim\fR is a single space. The value of \fBdelim\fR can be a string of arbitrary length. The delimiter cannot include comma (\fB,\fR) character, see \fBgetsubopt\fR(3C). These listing options can be used to create parsable output. See \fBNOTES\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Hardware resources enter the unconfigured pool in a hardware specific manner. This can occur at various times such as: system initialization or as a result of an unconfigure operation. An occupant that is in the \fBunconfigured\fR state is not available for use by the system until specific intervention occurs. This intervention can be manifested as an operator initiated command or it can be by way of an automatic configuring mechanism.
.sp
.LP
The listing option of the \fBcfgadm\fR command can be used to provide parsable input for another command, for example within a shell script. For parsable output, the \fB-s\fR option must be used to select the fields required. The \fB-s\fR option can also be used to suppress the column headings. The following fields always produce parsable output: \fBap_id\fR, \fBphysid\fR, \fBr_state\fR, \fBo_state\fR, \fBcondition\fR, \fBbusy\fR \fBstatus_time_p\fR, \fBclass\fR, and \fBtype\fR. Parsable output never has white-space characters embedded in the field value.
