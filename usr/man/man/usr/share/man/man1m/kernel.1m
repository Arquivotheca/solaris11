.TH kernel 1M "27 Nov 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
kernel \- UNIX system executable file containing basic operating system services
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBkernel-name\fR [\fB-asrvx\fR] [\fB-m \fIsmf_options\fR\fR] [\fB-i \fIaltinit\fR\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The operating system image, or kernel, is the collection of software comprising the image files (\fBunix\fR and \fBgenunix\fR) and the modules loaded at any instant in time. The system will not function without a kernel to control it.
.sp
.LP
The kernel is loaded by the \fBboot\fR(1M) command in a machine-specific way. The kernel may be loaded from disk, \fBCD-ROM\fR, or DVD (\fBdiskfull boot\fR) or over the network (\fBdiskless boot\fR). In either case, the directories under \fB/platform\fR and \fB/kernel\fR must be readable and must contain executable code which is able to perform the required kernel service. If the \fB-a\fR flag is given, the user is able to supply different pathnames for the default locations of the kernel and modules. See \fBboot\fR(1M) for more information on loading a specific kernel.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmoddir\fR variable contains a list of module directories separated by whitespace. moddir can be set in the \fB/etc/system\fR file. The minimal default is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/platform/platform-name/kernel /kernel /usr/kernel
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
This default can be supplemented by a specific platform. It is common for many SPARC systems to override the default path with:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
/platform/\fIplatform-name\fR/kernel:/platform/\fIhardware-class-name\fR\e
     /kernel:/kernel:/usr/kernel
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIplatform-name\fR can be found using the \fB-i\fR option of \fBuname\fR(1), and \fIhardware-class-name\fR can be found using the \fB-m\fR option of \fBuname\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
The kernel configuration can be controlled using the \fB/etc/system\fR file (see \fBsystem\fR(4)).
.sp
.LP
\fBgenunix\fR is the platform-independent component of the base kernel.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Asks the user for configuration information, such as where to find the system file, where to mount \fBroot\fR, and even override the name of the kernel itself. Default responses will be contained in square brackets ([ ]), and the user may simply enter RETURN to use the default response (note that RETURN is labeled ENTER on some keyboards). To help repair a damaged \fB/etc/system\fR file, enter \fB/dev/null\fR at the prompt that asks for the pathname of the system configuration file. See \fBsystem\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIaltinit\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Select an alternative executable to be the primordial process. \fIaltinit\fR must be a valid path to an executable. The default primordial process is \fBinit\fR(1M).

\fB\fB-m\fR \fIsmf_options\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fIsmf_options\fR include two categories of options to control booting behavior of the service management facility: recovery options and messages options.
.sp
Message options determine the type and amount of messages that \fBsmf\fR(5) displays during boot. Service options determine the services which are used to boot the system. 
.sp

.RS 4n
Boot with some SMF services temporarily disabled, as indicated by \fImilestone\fR. \fImilestone\fR can be "none", "single-user", "multi-user", "multi-user-server", or "all". See the \fBmilestone\fR subcommand of \fBsvcadm\fR(1M).

The kernel gives various warnings and error messages. If the kernel detects an unrecoverable fault, it will panic or halt.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Reconfiguration boot will, by design, not remove \fB/dev\fR entries for some classes of devices that have been physically removed from the system.
