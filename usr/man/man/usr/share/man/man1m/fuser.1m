.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfuser\fR utility displays the process \fBID\fRs of the processes that are using the \fIfiles\fR specified as arguments.
.sp

Each process \fBID\fR is followed by a letter code. These letter codes are interpreted as follows. If the process is using the file as

.LP
For block special devices with mounted file systems, all processes using any file on that device are listed. For all types of files (text files, executables, directories, devices, and so forth), only the processes using that file are reported.
.sp
.LP
For all types of devices, \fBfuser\fR also displays any known kernel consumers that have the device open. Kernel consumers are displayed in one of the following formats:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[\fImodule_name\fR]
[\fImodule_name\fR,dev_path=\fIpath\fR]
[\fImodule_name\fR,dev=(\fImajor\fR,\fIminor\fR)]
[\fImodule_name\fR,dev=(\fImajor\fR,\fIminor\fR),dev_path=\fIpath\fR]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If more than one group of files are specified, the options may be respecified for each additional group of files. A lone dash cancels the options currently in force.
.sp
.LP
The process IDs are printed as a single line on the standard output, separated by spaces. All other output, including the single terminating newline, is written on standard error.
.sp
.LP
Any user can run fuser, but only the superuser can terminate another user's process.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Reports on files that are mount points for file systems, and any files within that mounted file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Report device usage information for all minor nodes bound to the same device node as the specified minor node. This option does not report file usage for files within a mounted file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Prints a report for the named file, not for files within a mounted file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Sends the \fBSIGKILL\fR signal to each process. Since this option spawns kills for each process, the kill messages may not show up immediately (see \fBkill\fR(2)). No signals will be sent to kernel file consumers.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Lists only processes with non-blocking mandatory locks on a file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIsig\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Sends a signal to each process. The \fIsig\fR option argument specifies one of the symbolic names defined in the \fB<signal.h>\fR header, or a decimal integer signal number. If \fIsig\fR is a symbolic name, it is recognized in a case-independent fashion, without the \fBSIG\fR prefix. The \fB-k\fR option is equivalent to \fB-s\fR \fBKILL\fR or \fB-s\fR \fB9\fR. No signals will be sent to kernel file consumers.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Displays the user login name in parentheses following the process \fBID\fR.

\fBExample 2 \fRRestricting Output when Reporting on the Mount Point and Files
.sp
.LP
The following example reports on the mount point and files within the mounted file system, but the output is restricted to processes that hold non-blocking mandatory locks.

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRSending SIGTERM to Processes Holding a Non-blocking Mandatory Lock
.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Because \fBfuser\fR works with a snapshot of the system image, it may miss processes that begin using a file while \fBfuser\fR is running. Also, processes reported as using a file may have stopped using it while \fBfuser\fR was running. These factors should discourage the use of the \fB-k\fR option.
