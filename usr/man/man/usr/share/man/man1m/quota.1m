.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBquota\fR displays quotas for NFS mounted UFS- or ZFS-based file systems if the \fBrquotad\fR daemon is running. See \fBrquotad\fR(1M). In a \fBzones\fR(5) environment, \fBquota\fR displays quotas only for the zone in which it is invoked.
.sp
.LP
\fBquota\fR can display entries for the same file system multiple times for multiple mount points. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBquota -v user1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
might display identical quota information for \fBuser1\fR at the mount 	points \fB/home/user1\fR, \fB/home/user2\fR, and \fB/home/user\fR, if all three mount points are mounted from the same file system with quotas turned on.
