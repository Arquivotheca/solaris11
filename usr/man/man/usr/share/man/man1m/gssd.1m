.SH NAME
gssd \- generates and validates GSS-API tokens for kernel RPC
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\fB/usr/lib/gss/gssd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fB\fR\fBgssd\fR is the user mode daemon that operates between the kernel rpc and the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (\fBGSS-API\fR) to generate and validate \fBGSS-API\fR security tokens. In addition, \fBgssd\fR maps the \fBGSS-API\fR principal names to the local user and group ids. By default, all groups that the requested user belongs to will be included in the grouplist credential. \fBgssd\fR is invoked by the Internet daemon \fBinetd\fR(1m) the first time that the kernel \fBRPC\fR requests \fBGSS-API\fR services.
