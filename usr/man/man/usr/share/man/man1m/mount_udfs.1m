     [\fB-O\fR] \fIspecial\fR \fImount_point\fR

\fBmount\fR \fB-F\fR udfs [\fIgeneric_options\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIspecific_options\fR]
     [\fB-O\fR] \fIspecial\fR | \fImount_point\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmount\fR utility attaches a \fBudfs\fR file system to the file system hierarchy at the \fImount_point\fR, which is the pathname of a directory. If \fImount_point\fR has any contents prior to the mount operation, these are hidden until the file system is unmounted.
.sp
.LP
If mount is invoked with either \fIspecial\fR or \fImount_point\fR as the only arguments, \fBmount\fR searches \fB/etc/vfstab\fR to fill in the missing arguments, including the \fIspecific_options\fR. See \fBmount\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The \fBudfs\fR file system supports direct mounting of files containing the file system as well as block devices. See \fBmount\fR(1M) and \fBlofiadm\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
If \fIspecial\fR and \fImount_point\fR are specified without any \fIspecific_options\fR, the default is \fBrw\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
See \fBmount\fR(1M) for the list of supported \fIgeneric_options\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIspecific_options\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify \fBudfs\fR file system specific options in a comma-separated list with no intervening spaces. The following \fIspecific_options\fR are available:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBm\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Mount the file system without making an entry in \fB/etc/mnttab\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBremount\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Remount the file system as read-write. The option is used in conjunction with the \fBrw\fR option. 
.sp
A file system mounted read-only can be remounted as read-write. This option fails if the file system is not currently mounted.

\fB\fB-O\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Overlay mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file system inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount fails, producing the error \f(CWdevice busy\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Copy-protected files can be stored on \fBDVD-ROM\fR media using Universal Disk Format (\fBUDF\fR). Reading these copy-protected files is not possible as this involves an authentication process. Unless an authentication process between the host and the drive is completed, reading these copy-protected files after mounting and before the authentication process, returns an error.
