.SH NAME
pooladm \- activate and deactivate the resource pools facility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/pooladm\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-c\fR] [\fIfilename\fR] | \fB-x\fR

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpooladm\fR command provides administrative operations on pools and sets. \fBpooladm\fR reads the specified filename and attempts to activate the pool configuration contained in it.
.sp
.LP
Before updating the current pool run-time configuration, \fBpooladm\fR validates the configuration for correctness. 
.sp
.LP
Without options, \fBpooladm\fR prints out the current running pools configuration. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Instantiate the configuration at the given location. If a filename is not specified, it defaults to \fB/etc/pooladm.conf\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Disable the pools facility so that pools can no longer be manipulated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Enable the pools facility so that pools can be manipulated. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Validate the configuration without actually updating the current active configuration. Checks that there are no syntactic errors and that the configuration can be instantiated on the current system. No validation of application specific properties is performed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Update the specified location with the details of the current dynamic configuration.
.sp
This option requires update permission for the configuration that you are going to update. If you use this option with the \fB-c\fR option, the dynamic configuration is updated before the static location. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Remove the currently active pool configuration. Destroy all defined resources, and return all formerly partitioned components to their default resources. 
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Use the configuration contained within this file. 
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRInstantiating a Configuration
.sp
.LP
The following command instantiates the configuration contained at \fB/home/admin/newconfig\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/pooladm \fR\fB-c\fR\fB /home/admin/newconfig\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRValidating the Configuration Without Instantiating It
.sp
.LP
The following command attempts to instantiate the configuration contained at \fB/home/admin/newconfig\fR. It displays any error conditions that it encounters, but does not actually modify the active configuration.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/pooladm \fR\fB-n\fR\fB \fR\fB-c\fR\fB /home/admin/newconfig\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRRemoving the Current Configuration
.sp
.LP
The following command removes the current pool configuration:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/pooladm \fR\fB-x\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fREnabling the Pools Facility
.sp
.LP
The following command enables the pool facility:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/pooladm -e\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 5 \fREnabling the Pools Facility Using SMF
.sp
.LP
The following command enables the pool facility through use of the Service Management Facility. See \fBsmf\fR(5).

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/svcadm enable svc:/system/pools:default\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 6 \fRSaving the Active Configuration to a Specified Location
.sp
.LP
The following command saves the active configuration to \fB/tmp/state.backup\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example# \fB/usr/sbin/pooladm -s /tmp/state.backup\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH FILES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/etc/pooladm.conf\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Configuration file for \fBpooladm\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Resource bindings that are not presented in the form of a binding to a partitionable resource, such as the scheduling class, are not necessarily modified in a \fBpooladm\fR \fB-x\fR operation.
.sp
.LP
The pools facility is not active by default when Solaris starts. \fBpooladm\fR \fB-e\fR explicitly activates the pools facility. The behavior of certain APIs related to processor partitioning and process binding are modified when pools is active. See \fBlibpool\fR(3LIB).
.sp
.LP
You cannot enable the pools facility on a system where processor sets have been created. Use the \fBpsrset\fR(1M) command or \fBpset_destroy\fR(2) to destroy processor sets manually before you enable the pools facility.
.sp
.LP
Because the Resource Pools facility is an \fBsmf\fR(5) service, it can also be enabled and disabled using the standard SMF interfaces.
