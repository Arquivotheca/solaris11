.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfsck\fR audits and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions on file systems. A file system to be checked can be specified by giving the name of the block or character special device or by giving the name of its mount point if a matching entry exists in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fIspecial\fR represents the character special device, for example, \fB/dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s0\fR, on which the file system resides. The character special device, not the block special device should be used. \fBfsck\fR does not work on a mounted block device.
.sp
.LP
If no special device is specified, all \fBudfs\fR file systems specified in the \fBvfstab\fR file with a \fBfsckdev\fR entry are checked. If the \fB-p\fR (\fBpreen\fR) option is specified, \fBudfs\fR file systems with an \fBfsckpass\fR number greater than \fB1\fR are checked in parallel. See \fBfsck\fR(1M). 
.sp
.LP
In the case of correcting serious inconsistencies, by default, \fBfsck\fR asks for confirmation before making a repair and waits for the operator to respond with either \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. If the operator does not have write permission on the file system, \fBfsck\fR defaults to the \fB-n\fR (no corrections) option. See \fBfsck\fR(1M). 
.sp
.LP
Repairing some file system inconsistencies can result in loss of data. The amount and severity of data loss can be determined from the diagnostic output. 
.sp
.LP
\fBfsck\fR automatically corrects innocuous inconsistencies. It displays a message for each corrected inconsistency that identifies the nature of the correction which took place on the file system. After successfully correcting a file system, \fBfsck\fR prints the number of files on that file system and the number of used and free blocks. 
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported: 
.sp

The following \fIgeneric_options\fR are supported:
.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Check but do not repair. This option checks to be sure that the file system is suitable for mounting, and returns the appropriate exit status. If the file system is ready for mounting, \fBfsck \fRdisplays a message such as: 
.sp

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The operating system buffers file system data. Running \fBfsck\fR on a mounted file system can cause the operating system's buffers to become out of date with respect to the disk. For this reason, use \fBfsck\fR only when the file system is unmounted. If this is not possible, take care that the system is quiescent and that it is rebooted immediately after running \fBfsck\fR. A panic will probably occur if running \fBfsck\fR on a file system that modifies the file system while it is mounted.
.sp
.LP
If an unmount of the file system is not done before the system is shut down, the file system might become corrupted. In this case, a file system check needs to be completed before the next mount operation.
