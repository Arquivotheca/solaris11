.SH NAME
edquota \- edit user quotas for ufs file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBedquota\fR [\fB-p\fR \fIproto_user\fR] \fIusername\fR...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBedquota\fR \fB-t\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBedquota\fR is a quota editor.  One or more users may be specified on the command line. For each user a temporary file is created with an \fBASCII\fR representation of the current disk quotas for that user for each mounted ufs file system that has a \fBquotas\fR file, and an editor is then invoked on the file. The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc. Upon leaving the editor, \fBedquota\fR reads the temporary file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes made.
.sp
.LP
The editor invoked is \fBvi\fR(1) unless the \fBEDITOR\fR environment variable specifies otherwise.
.sp
.LP
Only the super-user may edit quotas.  In order for quotas to be established on a file system, the root directory of the file system must contain a file, owned by root, called \fBquotas\fR. (See \fBquotaon\fR(1M).)
.sp
.LP
\fIproto_user\fR and \fIusername\fR can be numeric, corresponding to the  \fBUID\fR of a user. Unassigned UIDs may be specified; unassigned names may not. In this way, default quotas can be established for users who are later assigned a UID.
.sp
.LP
If no options are specified, the temporary file created will have one or more lines of the format, where a block is considered to be a 1024 byte (1K) block:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
fs\fI mount_point\fR blocks (soft =\fInumber\fR, \e
     hard =\fInumber\fR ) inodes (soft =\fInumber\fR, \e
     hard =\fInumber\fR)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The  \fInumber\fR fields may be modified to reflect desired values.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Duplicate the quotas of the \fIproto_user\fR specified for each \fIusername\fR specified. This is the normal mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Edit the soft time limits for each file system. If the time limits are zero, the default time limits in \fB/usr/include/sys/fs/ufs_quota.h\fR are used. The temporary file created will have one or more lines of the form
.sp
fs \fImount_point\fR blocks time limit = \fInumber tmunit\fR,  files time limit = \fInumber tmunit\fR
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fItmunit\fR may be one of ``month'', ``week'', ``day'', ``hour'', ``min'' or ``sec''; characters appended to these keywords are ignored, so you may write ``months'' or ``minutes'' if you prefer. The \fInumber\fR and\fI tmunit\fR fields may be modified to set desired values. Time limits are printed in the greatest possible time unit such that the value is greater than or equal to one. If ``default'' is printed after the \fItmunit\fR, this indicates that the value shown is zero (the default).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBedquota\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
