.SH NAME
fwtmp, wtmpfix \- manipulate connect accounting records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/acct/fwtmp\fR [\fB-ic\fR]

\fB/usr/lib/acct/wtmpfix\fR [\fIfile\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfwtmp\fR reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output, converting binary records of the type found in \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR to formatted ASCII records. The ASCII version is useful when it is necessary to edit  bad records.
.sp
.LP
\fBwtmpfix\fR examines the standard input or named files in \fButmpx\fR format, corrects the time/date stamps to make the entries consistent, and writes to the standard output. A hyphen (\fB\(mi\fR) can be used in place of \fIfile\fR to indicate the standard input. If time/date corrections are not performed, \fBacctcon\fR(1M) will fault when it encounters certain date-change records.
.sp
.LP
Each time the date is set, a pair of date change records are written to \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR. The first record is the old date denoted by the string "\fBold time\fR" placed in the \fBline\fR field and the flag \fB\fR\fBOLD_TIME\fR\fB\fR placed in the \fBtype\fR field of the \fButmpx\fR structure. The second record specifies the new date and is denoted by the string \fBnew time\fR placed in the \fBline\fR field and the flag \fB\fR\fBNEW_TIME\fR\fB\fR placed in the \fBtype\fR field. \fBwtmpfix\fR uses these records to synchronize all time stamps in the file.
.sp
.LP
In addition to correcting time/date stamps, \fBwtmpfix\fR will check the validity of the \fBname\fR field to ensure that it consists solely of alphanumeric characters or spaces. If it encounters a name that is considered invalid, it will change the login name to \fB\fR\fBINVALID\fR\fB\fR and write a diagnostic to the standard error. In this way, \fBwtmpfix\fR reduces the chance that \fBacctcon\fR will fail when processing connect accounting records.
