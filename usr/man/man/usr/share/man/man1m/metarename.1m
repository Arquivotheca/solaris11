.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
There are two ways to use \fBmetarename\fR, one with and one without the \fB-x\fR option. The first method (without \fB-x\fR) renames an existing metadevice to a new name. This makes managing the metadevice namespace easier. The metadevice being renamed cannot be mounted or open, nor can the new name already exist. For example, to rename a metadevice that contains a mounted file system, you would first need to unmount the file system.
.sp
.LP
With the second way to use \fBmetarename\fR, using the \fB-x\fR option, \fBmetarename\fR switches (exchanges) the names of an existing layered metadevice and one of its subdevices. In Solaris Volume Manager terms, a layered metadevice can be either a mirror or a trans metadevice. The \fB-x\fR option enables you to switch the metadevice names of a mirror and one of its submirrors, or a trans metadevice and its master device.
.sp
.LP
\fBmetarename\fR \fB-x\fR makes it easier to mirror or unmirror an existing stripe or concatenation, and to remove a trans device.
.sp
.LP
When used to mirror an existing stripe or concatenatation, you must stop access to the device. For example, if the device contains a mounted file system, you must first unmount the file system before doing the rename.
.sp
.LP
You can also use the \fBmetarename\fR \fB-x\fR command to untrans a trans metadevice from an existing device. This applies only to the master device. You cannot remove a logging device with \fBmetarename\fR. Before you can rename a trans device, you must detach the logging device. Then you must stop access to the trans metadevice itself.
.sp
.LP
You cannot rename or switch metadevices that are in an error state or that have subcomponents in an error state, or metadevices actively using a hot spare replacement.
.sp
.LP
You can only switch metadevices that have a direct child/parent relationship. You could not, for example, directly exchange a stripe in a mirror that is a master device with the trans metadevice.
.sp
.LP
You must use the \fB-f\fR flag when switching members of a trans metadevice.
.sp
.LP
Only metadevices can be switched, not slices.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRRenaming a Metadevice
.sp
.LP
This example renames a metadevice named \fBd10\fR to \fBaccount_records\fR. Note that \fBaccount_records\fR must not exist for the rename to succeed.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metarename d10 account_records
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRCreating a Two-Way Mirror
.sp
.LP
This example creates a two-way mirror from an existing stripe named \fBd1\fR with a mounted file system, \fB/home2\fR. 

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# metainit d2 1 1 c13d0s1
# metainit -f d20 -m d1
# umount /home2
# metarename -x d20 d1
# metattach d1 d2
# mount /home2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
First, a second concatenation \fBd2\fR, is created. (\fBd1\fR already exists.) The \fBmetainit\fR command creates a one-way mirror, \fBd20\fR, from \fBd1\fR. Next, you umount the file system and switch \fBd1\fR for \fBd20\fR, making \fBd1\fR the top-level device (mirror). You attach the second submirror, \fBd2\fR, to create a two-way mirror. Lastly, you remount the file system.

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRMounting a Mirrored File System on Stripe
.sp
.LP
This example takes an existing mirror named \fBd1\fR with a mounted file system, and ends up with the file system mounted on a stripe \fBd1\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# umount /fs2
# metarename -x d1 d20
# metadetach d20 d1
# metaclear -r d20
# mount /fs2
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
First, you unmount the file system, then switch the mirror \fBd1\fR and its submirror \fBd20\fR. This makes the mirror into \fBd20\fR. Next, you detach \fBd1\fR from \fBd20\fR, then delete the mirror \fBd20\fR and its other submirror. You then remount the file system.

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRDeleting a Trans Metadevice
.sp
.LP
This example deletes a trans metadevice named \fBd10\fR while its mount point is \fB/myhome\fR. The master device, which is a stripe, is named \fBd2\fR. The logging device, also a stripe, is named \fBd5\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# umount /myhome
# metadetach d10
# metarename -f -x d10 d2
# metaclear d2
# metaclear d5
# fsck /dev/md/dsk/d10
# mount /myhome
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
You umount the file system first, then detach the trans metadevice's logging device. The trans metadevice is switched with the master device, making the trans metadevice \fBd2\fR and the underlying stripe \fBd10\fR. You clear the trans metadevice \fBd2\fR and the logging device \fBd5\fR. \fBd10\fR must be \fBfsck\fR'd, and then the file system is remounted.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
.LP
Renaming and exchanging metadevice names can only be used for metadevices. A physical slice cannot be renamed to a metadevice, nor can a metadevice be exchanged with a physical slice name.
.sp
.LP
Metadevice names are strings of the pattern \fId\fR\fB<\fR\fIxyz\fR\fB>\fR where \fIxyz\fR is a value between \fB0\fR and \fB8192\fR. You cannot use logical names for metadevices.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Trans metadevices have been replaced by UFS logging. Existing trans devices are \fBnot\fR logging--they pass data directly through to the underlying device. See \fBmount_ufs\fR(1M) for more information about UFS logging.
