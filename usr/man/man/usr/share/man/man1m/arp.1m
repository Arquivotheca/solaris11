.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBarp\fR program displays and modifies the Internet-to-MAC address translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (see \fBarp\fR(7P)).
.sp
.LP
With no flags, the program displays the current \fBARP\fR entry for \fIhostname\fR. The host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot notation.
.sp
.LP
Options that modify the ARP translation tables (\fB-d\fR, \fB-f\fR, and \fB-s\fR) can be used only when the invoked command is granted the \fBsys_net_config\fR privilege. See \fBprivileges\fR(5).

\fB\fB-a\fR\fR

Display all of the current \fBARP\fR entries. The definition for the flags in the table are: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Unverified; this is a local IP address that is currently undergoing Duplicate Address Detection. ARP will not respond to requests for this address until Duplicate Address Detection completes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBo\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Old; this entry is aging away. If IP requests it again, a new ARP query will be generated. This state is used for detecting peer address changes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBy\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Delayed; periodic address defense and conflict detection was unable to send a packet due to internal network use limits for non-traffic-related messages (100 packets per hour per interface). This occurs only on interfaces with very large numbers of aliases.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fBA\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Authority; this machine is authoritative for this IP address. ARP will not accept updates from other machines for this entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Local; this is a local IP address configured on one of the machine's logical interfaces. ARP will defend this address if another node attempts to claim it.

\fB\fBM\fR\fR

Mapping; only used for the multicast entry for \fB224.0.0.0\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBP\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Publish; includes IP address for the machine and the addresses that have explicitly been added by the \fB-s\fR option. ARP will respond to ARP requests for this address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBS\fR\fR

.RS 5n
.rt  
Static; entry cannot be changed by learned information. This indicates that the \fBpermanent\fR flag was used when creating the entry.

.ne 2

\fB\fBU\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
Unresolved; waiting for ARP response.
.RE

You can use the \fB-n\fR option with the \fB-a\fR option to disable the automatic numeric IP address-to-name translation. Use \fBarp\fR \fB-an\fR or \fBarp\fR \fB-na\fR to display numeric IP addresses. The \fBarp\fR \fB-a\fR option is equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBnetstat -p -f inet\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

\&...and \fB-an\fR and \fB-na\fR are equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBnetstat -pn -f inet\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Delete an entry for the host called \fIhostname\fR.
.sp
Note that ARP entries for IPMP (IP Network Multipathing) data and test addresses are managed by the kernel and thus cannot be deleted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Read the file named \fIfilename\fR and set multiple entries in the \fBARP\fR tables. Entries in the file should be of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIhostname\fR \fIMACaddress\fR [temp] [pub] [trail] [permanent]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

See the \fB-s\fR option for argument definitions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Create an \fBARP\fR entry for the host called \fIhostname\fR with the MAC address \fIMACaddress\fR. For example, an Ethernet address is given as six hexadecimal bytes separated by colons. The entry will not be subject to deletion by aging unless the word \fBtemp\fR is specified in the command. If the word \fBpub\fR is specified, the entry will be published, which means that this system will respond to ARP requests for \fIhostname\fR even though the \fIhostname\fR is not its own. The word \fBpermanent\fR indicates that the system will not accept MAC address changes for \fIhostname\fR from the network.
.sp
Solaris does not implement trailer encapsulation, and the word \fBtrail\fR is accepted on entries for compatibility only.
.sp
\fBarp\fR \fB-s\fR can be used for a limited form of proxy ARP when a host on one of the directly attached networks is not physically present on a subnet. Another machine can then be configured to respond to ARP requests using \fBarp\fR \fB-s\fR. This is useful in certain SLIP configurations.
.sp
Non-temporary proxy ARP entries for an IPMP (IP Network Multipathing) group are automatically managed by the kernel. Specifically, if the hardware address in an entry matches the hardware address of an IP interface in an IPMP group, and the IP address is not local to the system, this will be regarded as an IPMP proxy ARP entry. This entry will have its hardware address automatically adjusted in order to keep the IP address reachable so long as the IPMP group has not entirely failed.
.sp
ARP entries must be consistent across an IPMP group. Therefore, ARP entries cannot be associated with individual underlying IP interfaces in an IPMP group, and must instead be associated with the corresponding IPMP IP interface.
.sp
Note that ARP entries for IPMP data and test addresses are managed by the kernel and thus cannot be changed.
