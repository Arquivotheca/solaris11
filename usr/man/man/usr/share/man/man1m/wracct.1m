.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwracct\fR utility allows the administrator to invoke the extended accounting system, if active, to write intermediate records representing the resource usage of a selected set of processes or tasks. For tasks, a \fIrecord_type\fR option is also supported, allowing the administrator to request the writing of:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
an interval record, which reflects task usage since a previous interval record (or since task creation if there is no interval record), or
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
a partial record, which reflects usage since task creation.
