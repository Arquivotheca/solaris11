.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBvmstat\fR reports virtual memory statistics regarding kernel thread, virtual memory, disk, trap, and \fBCPU\fR activity.
.sp
.LP
On \fBMP\fR (multi-processor) systems, \fBvmstat\fR averages the number of \fBCPUs\fR into the output. For per-processor statistics, see \fBmpstat\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
\fBvmstat\fR only supports statistics for certain devices. For more general system statistics, use \fBsar\fR(1), \fBiostat\fR(1M), or \fBsar\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Without options, \fBvmstat\fR displays a one-line summary of the virtual memory activity since the system was booted.
.sp
.LP
During execution of the kernel status command, the \fBstate\fR of the system can change. If relevant, a state change message is included in the \fBvmstat\fR output, in one of the following forms:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
<<device added: sd0>>
<<device removed: sd0>>
<<processors added: 1, 3>>
<<processors removed: 1, 3>>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
See \fISystem Administration Guide: Common Management Tasks\fR for device naming conventions for disks.

.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcount\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdisks\fR\fR
.ad

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIinterval\fR\fR
