.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rlogind\fR is the server for the \fBrlogin\fR(1) program.  The server provides a remote login facility with authentication based on Kerberos V5 or privileged port numbers.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rlogind\fR is invoked by \fBinetd\fR(1M) when a remote login connection is established. When Kerberos V5 authentication is required (see option \fB-k\fR below), the authentication sequence is as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Check Kerberos V5 authentication.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Check authorization according to the rules in \fBkrb5_auth_rules\fR(5).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Prompt for a password if any checks fail and \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR is configured to do so.
.RE
.sp
.LP
In order for Kerberos authentication to work, a \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR Kerberos principal must exist for each Fully Qualified Domain Name associated with the \fBin.rlogind\fR server. Each of these \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR principals must have a \fBkeytab\fR entry in the \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR file on the \fBin.rlogind\fR server. An example principal might be:
.sp
.LP
\fBhost/bigmachine.eng.example.com\fR
.sp
.LP
See \fBkadmin\fR(1M) or \fBgkadmin\fR(1M) for instructions on adding a principal to a \fBkrb5.keytab\fR file. See \fI\fR for a discussion of Kerberos authentication.
.sp
.LP
If Kerberos V5 authentication is not enabled, then the authentication procedure follows the standard \fBrlogin\fR protocol:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The server checks the client's source port. If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server aborts the connection.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The server checks the client's source address. If an entry for the client exists in both \fB/etc/hosts\fR and \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR, a user logging in from the client is not prompted for a password. If the address is associated with a host for which no corresponding entry exists in \fB/etc/hosts\fR, the user is prompted for a password, regardless of  whether or not an entry for the client is present in  \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR. See \fBhosts\fR(4) and \fBhosts.equiv\fR(4).
.RE
.sp
.LP
Once the source port and address have been checked, \fBin.rlogind\fR allocates a pseudo-terminal and manipulates file descriptors so that the slave half of the pseudo-terminal becomes the \fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, and \fBstderr\fR for a login process. The login process is an instance of the \fBlogin\fR(1) program, invoked with the \fB-r\fR.
.sp
.LP
The login process then proceeds with the \fBpam\fR(3PAM) authentication process. See \fBSECURITY\fR below.  If automatic authentication fails, it reprompts the user to login.
.sp
.LP
The parent of the login process manipulates the master side of the pseudo-terminal, operating as an intermediary between the login process and the client instance of the \fBrlogin\fR program.  In normal operation, a packet protocol is invoked to provide Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q type facilities and propagate interrupt signals to the remote programs. The login process propagates the client terminal's baud rate and terminal type, as found in the environment variable, \fBTERM\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-5\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Same as \fB-k\fR, for backwards compatibility.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Requires Kerberos V5 clients to present a cryptographic checksum of initial connection information like the name of the user that the client is  trying  to access in the initial authenticator. This checksum provides additionl security by preventing an attacker from changing the initial connection information. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-i\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Creates an encrypted session.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Ignores authenticator checksums if provided. This option ignores authenticator checksums presented by current Kerberos clients to protect initial connection  information. Option \fB-i\fR is the opposite of option \fB-c\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt

\fB\fB-M\fR \fIrealm\fR\fR

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
\fBrlogind\fR and \fBin.rlogind\fR are IPv6-enabled. See \fBip6\fR(7P). \fBIPv6\fR is not currently supported with Kerberos V5 authentication.
.sp
.LP
Typically, Kerberized \fBrlogin\fR service runs on port 543 (klogin) and Kerberized, encrypted \fBrlogin\fR service runs on port 2105 (eklogin). The corresponding FMRI entries are: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/login:klogin (rlogin with kerberos)
svc:/network/login:eklogin (rlogin with kerberos and encryption)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rlogind\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management, and session management. The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBin.rlogind\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for the \fBrlogin\fR command using the "rhosts" and UNIX authentication modules, and the UNIX account, session management, and password management modules.

With this configuration, the server checks the client's source address. If an entry for the client exists in both \fB/etc/hosts\fR and \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR, a user logging in from the client is not prompted for a password. If the address is associated with a host for which no corresponding entry exists in \fB/etc/hosts\fR, the user is prompted for a password, regardless of whether or not an entry for the client is present in \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR. See \fBhosts\fR(4) and \fBhosts.equiv\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
When running a Kerberized rlogin service (with or without the encryption option), the pam service name that should be used is "\fBkrlogin\fR".
.sp
.LP
If there are no entries for the \fBrlogin\fR service, then the entries for the "other" service will be used. If multiple authentication modules are listed, then the user may be prompted for multiple passwords. Removing the \fBpam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR entry will disable the \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR and \fB~/.rhosts\fR authentication protocol and the user would always be forced to type the password. The \fIsufficient\fR flag indicates that authentication through the \fBpam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR module is sufficient to authenticate the user. Only if this authentication fails is the next authentication module used.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity of each client machine and the connecting medium.  This is insecure, but it is useful in an ``open'' environment.
.sp
.LP
A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be present.

.LP
The \fBin.rlogind\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp

svc:/network/login:klogin (rlogin with kerberos)
svc:/network/login:eklogin (rlogin with kerberos and encryption)
