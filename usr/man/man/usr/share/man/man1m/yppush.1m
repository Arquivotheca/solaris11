.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fByppush\fR copies a new version of a  Network Information Service (\fBNIS\fR) map from the master \fBNIS\fR server to the slave \fBNIS\fR servers. It is normally run only on the master \fBNIS\fR server by the \fBMakefile\fR in \fB/var/yp\fR after the master databases are changed. It first constructs a list of \fBNIS\fR server hosts by reading the \fBNIS\fR \fBypservers\fR map within the \fIdomain\fR. Keys within the \fBypservers\fR map are the \fBASCII\fR names of the machines on which the \fBNIS\fR servers run.
.sp
.LP
A "transfer map" request is sent to the \fBNIS\fR server at each host, along with the information needed by the transfer agent (the program that actually moves the map) to call back the \fByppush\fR. When the attempt has completed (successfully or not), and the transfer agent has sent \fByppush\fR a status message, the results can be printed to \fBstdout\fR. Messages are also printed when a transfer is not possible, for instance, when the request message is undeliverable, or when the timeout period on responses has expired.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The Network Information Service (\fBNIS\fR) was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (\fBYP\fR). The functionality of the two remains the same; only the name has changed. The name Yellow Pages is a registered trademark in the United Kingdom of British Telecommunications PLC, and must not be used without permission.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
In the current implementation (version 2 \fBNIS\fR protocol), the transfer agent is \fBypxfr\fR(1M), which is started by the \fBypserv\fR program. If \fByppush\fR detects that it is speaking to a version 1 \fBNIS\fR protocol server, it uses the older protocol, sending a version 1 \fBYPPROC_GET\fR request and issues a message to that effect. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing if or when the map transfer is performed for version 1 servers. \fByppush\fR prints a message saying that an "old-style" message has been sent. The system administrator should later check to see that the transfer has actually taken place.
