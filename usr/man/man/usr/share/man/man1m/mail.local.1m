.SH NAME
mail.local \- store mail in a mailbox
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/mail.local\fR [\fB-f\fR \fIsender\fR] [\fB-d\fR] \fIrecipient\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmail.local\fR reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it to each user's mail file (mailbox). This program is intended to be used by \fBsendmail\fR(1M) as a mail delivery agent for local mail. It is not a user interface agent.
.sp
.LP
Messages are appended to the user's mail file in the \fB/var/mail\fR directory. The user must be a valid user name.
.sp
.LP
Each delivered mail message in the mailbox is preceded by a "Unix From line" with the following format:
.sp
.LP
\fBFrom\fR \fIsender_address\fR \fItime_stamp\fR
.sp
.LP
The \fIsender_address\fR is extracted from the \fBSMTP\fR envelope address (the envelope address is specified with the \fB-f\fR option).
.sp
.LP
A trailing blank line is also added to the end of each message.
.sp
.LP
The mail files are locked with a \fB\&.lock\fR file while mail is appended.
.sp
.LP
The mail files are created with mode \fB660\fR, owner is set to \fIrecipient\fR, and group is set to \fBmail\fR. If the ``biff'' service is returned by \fBgetservbyname\fR(3SOCKET), the biff server is notified of delivered mail. This program also computes the \fBContent-Length:\fR header which will be used by the mailbox reader to mark the message boundary.
