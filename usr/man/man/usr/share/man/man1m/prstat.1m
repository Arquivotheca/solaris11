.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBprstat\fR utility iteratively examines all active processes on the system and reports statistics based on the selected output mode and sort order. \fBprstat\fR provides options to examine only processes matching specified \fBPID\fRs, \fBUID\fRs, zone \fBID\fRs, \fBCPU\fR \fBID\fRs, and processor set \fBID\fRs.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-j\fR, \fB-k\fR, \fB-C\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-u\fR, \fB-U\fR, and \fB-z\fR options accept lists as arguments. Items in a list can be either separated by commas or enclosed in quotes and separated by commas or spaces.
.sp
.LP
If you do not specify an option, \fBprstat\fR examines all processes and reports statistics sorted by \fBCPU\fR usage.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Report only processes or lwps that are bound to processor sets in the given list. Each processor set is identified by an integer as reported by \fBpsrset\fR(1M). The load averages displayed are the sum of the load averages of the specified processor sets (see \fBpset_getloadavg\fR(3C)). Processes with one or more LWPs bound to processor sets in the given list are reported even when the \fB-L\fR option is not used.

\fB\fB-n\fR \fIntop\fR[\fI,nbottom\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Restrict number of output lines. The \fIntop\fR argument determines how many lines of process or \fBlwp\fR statistics are reported, and the \fInbottom\fR argument determines how many lines of user, task, or projects statistics are reported if the \fB-a\fR, \fB-t\fR, \fB-T\fR, \fB-J\fR or \fB-Z\fR options are specified. By default, \fBprstat\fR displays as many lines of output that fit in a window or terminal. When you specify the \fB-c\fR option or direct the output to a file, the default values for \fBntop\fR and \fBnbottom\fR are \fB15\fR and \fB5\fR.

.sp
.LP
The snapshot of system usage displayed by \fBprstat\fR is true only for a split-second, and it may not be accurate by the time it is displayed. When the \fB-m\fR option is specified, \fBprstat\fR tries to turn on microstate accounting for each process; the original state is restored when \fBprstat\fR exits. See \fBproc\fR(4) for additional information about the microstate accounting facility.
.sp
.LP
The total memory size reported in the SWAP and RSS columns for groups of processes can sometimes overestimate the actual amount of memory used by processes with shared memory segments.
