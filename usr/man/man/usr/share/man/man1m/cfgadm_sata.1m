.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBSATA\fR hardware specific library, \fB/usr/lib/cfgadm/sata.so.1\fR, provides the functionality for \fBSATA\fR hot plugging through the \fBcfgadm\fR command. \fBcfgadm\fR operates on attachment points, which are locations in the system where hardware resources can be dynamically reconfigured. See \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) for information regarding attachment points.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBSATA\fR controller's and port multiplier's device port is represented by an attachment point in the device tree. \fBSATA\fR devices, connected and configured in the system are shown as the attachment point name extension. The terms "attachment point" and "\fBSATA\fR port" are used interchangeably in the following description.
.sp
.LP
Attachment points are named through \fBap_id\fRs. All the \fBSATA\fR attachment points \fBap_id\fR consist of a string in the following form:
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
In general, the device identifier is derived from the corresponding logical link for the device in /\fIdev\fR. Because only one \fBLUN\fR (\fBLUN\fR 0) is supported by the \fBSATA\fR device, the "d" component of the device string will always have number 0 (zero).
.sp
.LP
For example, the logical \fBap_id\fR of the device port 4 of the port multiplier connected to the device port 5 of the \fBSATA\fR controller 2 would be:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sata2/5.4
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If the \fBSATA\fR disk or \fBCD\fR/\fBDVD\fR device is connected to this attachment point, and the device is configured, the \fIap_id\fR would be:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sata2/5.4::dsk/c2t645d0
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIcXtYd0\fR string identifying a device has one-to-one correspondence to the device attachment point.
.sp
.LP
A simple listing of attachment points in the system will include all \fBSATA\fR device ports and attached devices. For example:
.sp
.in +2

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
\fBcfgadm\fR defines several types of operations besides listing (\fB-l\fR). These operations include testing, (\fB-t\fR), invoking configuration state changes, (\fB-c\fR), invoking hardware specific functions (\fB-x\fR), and obtaining configuration administration help messages (\fB-h\fR).
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIfunction\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The following generic \fIfunction\fRs are defined for the \fBSATA\fR hardware specific library. For \fBSATA\fR port attachment point, the following configuration state change operations are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconnect\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable (activate) the \fBSATA\fR port and establish the communication with an attached device. This operation implies powering-on the port if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdisconnect\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unconfigure the attached device, if it is not already unconfigured, and disable (deactivate) the \fBSATA\fR port. A subsequent "\fBconnect\fR" command enables \fBSATA\fR port operation but does not bring a device to the "configured" state.
.RE

For a \fBSATA\fR device attached to the \fBSATA\fR port following state change operations are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconfigure\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Configure new device for use by the operating system if it is not already configured. This command also implies connect operation, if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBunconfigure\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Unconfigure the device connected to the \fBSATA\fR port if it is not already unconfigured.
.RE

The \fBconfigure\fR and \fBunconfigure\fR operations cannot be used for an attachment point where the port multiplier is connected. Port multipliers are configured and unconfigured automatically by the system. However, configure and unconfigure operations apply to all \fBSATA\fR devices connected to the port multiplier's device ports.

Some of the following commands used on the \fBSATA\fR ports or the \fBSATA\fR controller may affect any \fBSATA\fR devices that have been attached, as noted. \fBap_id\fR refers to \fBSATA\fR port or the entire \fBSATA\fR controller, as noted. If the operation implies unconfiguring a device, but it cannot be unconfigured (that is, the device contains a mounted filesystem), an error message is issued and the operation is not performed. An error message will be also issued if the \fBSATA\fR controller does not support specified operation.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The emergency "sata_port_deactivate" operation is not supported on ports with attached disks containing critical partitions such as root (/), /usr, swap, or /var. The deactivate operation should not be attempted on such ports. Incorrect usage can result in a system hang and require a reboot.
.sp
.LP
Hotplugging operations are not supported by all \fBSATA\fR controllers.
.sp
.LP
If \fBSATA\fR connectors are the hot-pluggable type and the \fBSATA\fR controller supports hotplugging, a \fBSATA\fR device can be hotplugged at any time. The system detects the event and establishes the communication with the device. The device has to be configured by the explicit "\fBcfgadm -c configure ap_id\fR" command.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBSATA\fR connectors are the hot-pluggable type and the \fBSATA\fR controller supports hotplugging, unplugging a device without unconfiguring it may result in system hang or data loss. If a device is unconfigured but receptacle state is not in a disconnected state, unplugging a device from the \fBSATA\fR port will result in error message.
.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The connectors on some \fBSATA\fR devices do not conform to \fBSATA\fR hotplug specifications. Performing hotplug operations on such devices can cause damage to the \fBSATA\fR controller and/or the \fBSATA\fR device.
