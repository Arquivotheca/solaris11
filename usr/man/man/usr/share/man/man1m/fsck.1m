.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfsck\fR audits and interactively repairs inconsistent file system conditions. If the file system is inconsistent the default action for each correction is to wait for the user to respond \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. If the user does not have write permission \fBfsck\fR defaults to a \fBno\fR action. Some corrective actions will result in loss of data. The amount and severity of data loss can be determined from the diagnostic output.
.sp
.LP
\fIFSType-specific-options\fR are options specified in a comma-separated (with no intervening spaces) list of options or keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by the \fIFSType-\fRspecific module of the command.
.sp
.LP
\fIspecial\fR represents the character special device on which the file system resides, for example, \fB/dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s7\fR. Note: the character special device, not the block special device, should be used. \fBfsck\fR will not work if the block device is mounted.
.sp
.LP
If no \fIspecial\fR device is specified \fBfsck\fR checks the file systems listed in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. Those entries in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR which have a character special device entry in the \fBfsckdev\fR field and have a non-zero numeric entry in the \fBfsckpass\fR field will be checked. Specifying \fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR limits the file systems to be checked to those of the type indicated.
.sp
.LP
If \fIspecial\fR is specified, but \fB-F\fR is not, the file system type will be determined by looking for a matching entry in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR. If no entry is found, the default local file system type specified in \fB/etc/default/fs\fR will be used.
.sp
.LP
If a file system type supports parallel checking, for example, \fBufs,\fR some file systems eligible for checking may be checked in parallel. Consult the file system-specific man page (for example, \fBfsck_ufs\fR(1M)) for more information.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following generic options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIFSType\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

Check but do not repair. This option checks that the file system is suitable for mounting, returning the appropriate exit status. If the file system is ready for mounting, \fBfsck\fR displays a message such as:

.sp .6
.RS 4n
If the file system is in the old (static table) format, convert it to the new (dynamic table) format. If the file system is in the new format, convert it to the old format provided the old format can support the file system configuration. In interactive mode, \fBfsck\fR will list the direction the conversion is to be made and ask whether the conversion should be done. If a negative answer is given, no further operations are done on the file system. In preen mode, the direction of the conversion is listed and done if possible without user interaction. Conversion in preen mode is best used when all the file systems are being converted at once. The format of a file system can be determined from the first line of output from \fBfstyp\fR(1M). Note: the \fBc\fR option is seldom used and is included only for compatibility with pre-4.1 releases. There is no guarantee that this option will be included in future releases.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The operating system buffers file system data. Running \fBfsck\fR on a mounted file system can cause the operating system's buffers to become out of date with respect to the disk. For this reason, the file system should be \fIunmounted\fR when \fBfsck\fR is used. If this is not possible, care should be taken that the system is quiescent and that it is rebooted immediately after \fBfsck\fR is run. Quite often, however, this will not be sufficient. A panic will probably occur if running \fBfsck\fR on a file system modifies the file system.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
This command may not be supported for all \fIFSTypes\fR.
.sp
.LP
Starting with Solaris 9, \fBfsck\fR manages extended attribute data on the disk. (See \fBfsattr\fR(5) for a description of extended file attributes.) A file system with extended attributes can be mounted on versions of Solaris that are not attribute-aware (versions prior to Solaris 9), but the attributes will not be accessible and \fBfsck\fR will strip them from the files and place them in \fBlost+found\fR. Once the attributes have been stripped, the file system is completely stable on versions of Solaris that are not attribute-aware, but would be considered corrupted on attribute-aware versions. In the latter circumstance, run the attribute-aware \fBfsck\fR to stabilize the file system before using it in an attribute-aware environment.
