.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rshd\fR is the server for the \fBrsh\fR(1) program. The server provides remote execution facilities with authentication based on Kerberos V5 or privileged port numbers.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rshd\fR is invoked by \fBinetd\fR(1M) each time a shell service is requested.
.sp
.LP
When Kerberos V5 authentication is required (this can be set with Kerberos-specific options listed below), the following protocol is initiated:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Check Kerberos V5 authentication.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Check authorization according to rules in \fBkrb5_auth_rules\fR(5).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
A null byte is returned on the initial socket and the command line is passed to the normal login shell of the user. (The \fBPATH\fR variable is set to \fB/usr/bin\fR.) The shell inherits the network connections established by \fBin.rshd\fR.
.RE
.sp
.LP
In order for Kerberos authentication to work, a \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR Kerberos principal must exist for each Fully Qualified Domain Name associated with the \fBin.rshd\fR server. Each of these \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR principals must have a \fBkeytab\fR entry in the \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR file on the \fBin.rshd\fR server. An example principal might be:
.sp
.LP
\fBhost/bigmachine.eng.example.com\fR
.sp
.LP
See \fBkadmin\fR(1M) or \fBgkadmin\fR(1M) for instructions on adding a principal to a \fBkrb5.keytab\fR file. See \fI\fR for a discussion of Kerberos authentication.
.sp
.LP
If Kerberos V5 authentication is not enabled, then \fBin.rshd\fR executes the following protocol:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The server checks the client's source port. If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server aborts the connection. The client's host address (in hex) and port number (in decimal) are the arguments passed to \fBin.rshd\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
The server reads characters from the socket up to a null (\fB\0\fR) byte. The resultant string is interpreted as an \fBASCII\fR number, base 10.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
If the number received in step 2 is non-zero, it is interpreted as the port number of a secondary stream to be used for the \fBstderr\fR. A second connection is then created to the specified port on the client's machine. The source port of this second connection is also in the range 512-1023.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
A null-terminated user name of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket. This user name is interpreted as the user identity on the \fIclient\fR's machine.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
5.
A null terminated user name of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket. This user name is interpreted as a user identity to use on the \fIserver\fR's machine.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
6.
A null terminated command to be passed to a shell is retrieved on the initial socket. The length of the command is limited by the upper bound on the size of the system's argument list.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
7.
\fBin.rshd\fR then validates the user according to the following steps. The remote user name is looked up in the password file and a \fBchdir\fR is performed to the user's home directory. If the lookup fails, the connection is terminated. If the \fBchdir\fR fails, it does a \fBchdir\fR to \fB/\fR (root). If the user is not the superuser, (user \fBID\fR 0), and if the pam_rhosts_auth \fBPAM\fR module is configured for authentication, the file \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR is consulted for a list of hosts considered "equivalent". If the client's host name is present in this file, the authentication is considered successful. See the SECURITY section below for a discussion of \fBPAM\fR authentication. 
.sp
If the lookup fails, or the user is the superuser, then the file \fB\&.rhosts\fR in the home directory of the remote user is checked for the machine name and identity of the user on the client's machine. If this lookup fails, the connection is terminated
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
8.
A null byte is returned on the initial connection and the command line is passed to the normal login shell of the user. The \fBPATH\fR variable is set to \fB/usr/bin\fR. The shell inherits the network connections established by \fBin.rshd\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-5\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Requires Kerberos V5 clients to present a cryptographic checksum of initial connection information like the name of the user that the client is trying to access in the initial authenticator. This checksum provides additionl security by preventing an attacker from changing the initial connection information. This option is mutually exclusive with the \fB-i\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-e\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Ignores authenticator checksums if provided. This option ignores authenticator checksums presented by current Kerberos clients to protect initial connection information. Option \fB-i\fR is the opposite of option \fB-c\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
\fBrshd\fR and \fBin.rshd\fR are IPv6-enabled. See \fBip6\fR(7P). \fBIPv6\fR is not currently supported with Kerberos V5 authentication.
.sp
.LP
The Kerberized \fBrshd\fR service runs on port 544 (kshell). The corresponding FMRI entry is: :
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/shell:kshell (rshd with kerberos (ipv4 only))
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rshd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management, and session management. The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBin.rshd\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for the \fBrsh\fR command using rhosts authentication, \fBUNIX\fR account management, and session management module.

If there are no entries for the \fBrsh\fR service, then the entries for the "other" service are used. To maintain the authentication requirement for \fBin.rshd\fR, the rsh entry must always be configured with the \fBpam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR module.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rshd\fR can authenticate using Kerberos V5 authentication or \fBpam\fR(3PAM). For Kerberized \fBrsh\fR service, the appropriate \fBPAM\fR service name is \fBkrsh\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity of each client machine and the connecting medium. This is insecure, but it is useful in an "open" environment.
.sp
.LP
A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be present.
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.rshd\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:

Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to \fBinetd\fR(1M). Use \fBinetadm\fR(1M) to make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
