.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmetaset\fR command administers sets of disks in named disk sets. Named disk sets include any disk set that is not in the local set. While disk sets enable a high-availability configuration, Solaris Volume Manager itself does not actually provide a high-availability environment.
.sp
.LP
A single-owner disk set configuration manages storage on a SAN or fabric-attached storage, or provides namespace control and state database replica management for a specified set of disks.
.sp
.LP
In a shared disk set configuration, multiple hosts are physically connected to the same set of disks. When one host fails, another host has exclusive access to the disks. Each host can control a shared disk set, but only one host can control it at a time.
.sp
.LP
When you add a new disk to any disk set, Solaris Volume Manager checks the disk format. If necessary, it repartitions the disk to ensure that the disk has an appropriately configured reserved slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) with adequate space for a state database replica. The precise size of slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) depends on the disk geometry. For tradtional disk sets, the slice is no less than 4 Mbytes, and probably closer to 6 Mbytes, depending on where the cylinder boundaries lie. For multi-owner disk sets, the slice is a minimum of 256 Mbytes. The minimal size for slice 7 might change in the future. This change is based on a variety of factors, including the size of the state database replica and information to be stored in the state database replica.
.sp
.LP
For use in disk sets, disks must have a dedicated slice (six or seven) that meets specific criteria:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice must start at sector 0 
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice must include enough space for disk label
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The state database replicas cannot be mounted
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The slice does not overlap with any other slices, including slice 2 
.RE
.sp
.LP
If the existing partition table does not meet these criteria, or if the -L flag is specified, Solaris Volume Manager repartitions the disk. A small portion of each drive is reserved in slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) for use by Solaris Volume Manager. The remainder of the space on each drive is placed into slice 0. Any existing data on the disks is lost by repartitioning.
.sp
.LP
After you add a drive to a disk set, it can be repartitioned as necessary, with the exception that slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device) is not altered in any way.
.sp
.LP
After a disk set is created and metadevices are set up within the set, the metadevice name is in the following form: 
.sp
.LP
\fB/dev/md/\fR\fIsetname\fR/{\fBdsk\fR,\fBrdsk\fR}/\fBd\fR\fInumber\fR
.sp
.LP
where \fIsetname\fR is the name of the disk set, and \fInumber\fR is the number of the metadevice (\fB0\fR-\fB127\fR).
.sp
.LP
If you have disk sets that you upgraded from Solstice DiskSuite software, the default state database replica size on those sets is 1034 blocks, not the 8192 block size from Solaris Volume Manager. Also, slice 7 on the disks that were added under Solstice DiskSuite are correspondingly smaller than slice 7 on disks that were added under Solaris Volume Manager.
.sp
.LP
If disks you add to a disk set have acceptable slice 7s (that start at cylinder 0 and that have sufficient space for the state database replica), they are not reformatted.
.sp
.LP
Hot spare pools within local disk sets use standard Solaris Volume Manager naming conventions. Hot spare pools with shared disk sets use the following convention:
.sp
.LP
\fIsetname\fR/\fIhot_spare_pool\fR
.sp
.LP
where \fIsetname\fR is the name of the disk set, and \fIhot_spare_pool\fR is the name of the hot spare pool associated with the disk set.
.SS "Multi-node Environment"
.sp
.LP
To create and work with a disk set in a multi\(emnode environment, \fBroot\fR must be a member of Group 14 on all hosts, or the \fB/.rhosts\fR file must contain an entry for all other host names. This is not required in a SunCluster 3.x enviroment.
.SS "Tagged data"
.sp
.LP
Tagged data occurs when there are different versions of a disk set's replicas. This tagged data consists of the set owner's nodename, the hardware serial number of the owner, and the time it was written out to the available replicas. The system administer can use this information to determine which replica contains the correct data.
.sp
.LP
When a disk set is configured with an even number of storage enclosures and has replicas balanced across them evenly, it is possible that up to half of the replicas can be lost (for example, through a power failure of half of the storage enclosures). After the enclosure that went down is rebooted, half of the replicas are not recognized by SVM. When the set is retaken, the \fBmetaset\fR command returns an error of "stale databases", and all of the metadevices are in a read-only state. 
.sp
.LP
Some of the replicas that are not recognized need to be deleted. The action of deleting the replicas also causes updates to the replicas that are not being deleted. In a dual hosted disk set environment, the second node can access the deleted replicas instead of the existing replicas when it takes the set. This leads to the possibility of getting the wrong replica record on a disk set take. An error message is displayed, and user intervention is required. 
.sp
.LP
Use the \fB-q\fR to query the disk set and the \fB-t\fR, \fB-u\fR, and \fB-y\fR, options to select the tag and take the disk set. See \fBOPTIONS\fR.
.SS "Mediator Configuration"
.sp
.LP
SVM provides support for a low-end HA solution consisting of two hosts that share only two strings of drives. The hosts in this type of configuration, referred to as \fBmediators\fR or mediator hosts, run a special daemon, \fBrpc.metamedd\fR(1M). The mediator hosts take on additional responsibilities to ensure that data is available in the case of host or drive failures.
.sp
.LP
A mediator configuration can survive the failure of a single host or a single string of drives, without administrative intervention. If both a host and a string of drives fail (multiple failures), the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. At this point, administrative intervention is required to make the data accessible. See \fBmediator\fR(7D) for further details.
.sp
.LP
Use the \fB-m\fR option to add or delete a mediator host. See \fBOPTIONS\fR.

.RS 4n
Add drives or hosts to the named set. For a drive to be accepted into a set, the drive must not be in use within another metadevice or disk set, mounted on, or swapped on. When the drive is accepted into the set, it is repartitioned and the metadevice state database replica (for the set) can be placed on it. However, if a slice 7 (or slice 6 on an EFI labelled device), starts at cylinder 0, and is large enough to hold a state database replica, then the disk is not repartitioned. Also, a drive is not accepted if it cannot be found on all hosts specified as part of the set. This means that if a host within the specified set is unreachable due to network problems, or is administratively down, the add fails.
.sp
Specify a drive name in the form \fBc\fR\fInum\fR\fBt\fR\fInum\fR\fBd\fR\fInum\fR. Do not specify a slice number (\fBs\fR\fInum\fR). For drives in a Sun Cluster, you must specify a complete pathname for each drive. Such a name has the form:

Add (\fB-a\fR) or delete (\fB-d\fR) mediator hosts to the specified disk set. A \fImediator_host_list\fR is the nodename (established by \fBsvc:/system/identity:node\fR \fBsmf\fR(5) service) of the mediator host to be added and (for adding) up to two other aliases for the mediator host. The nodename and aliases for each mediator host are separated only by commas. Up to three mediator hosts can be specified for the named disk set. Specify only the nodename of that host as the argument to \fB-m\fR to delete a mediator host.

Specify auto-take status for a disk set. If auto-take is enabled for a set, the disk set is automatically taken at boot, and file systems on volumes within the disk set can be mounted through \fB/etc/vfstab\fR entries. Only a single host can be associated with an auto-take set, so attempts to add a second host to an auto-take set or attempts to configure a disk set with multiple hosts as auto-take fails with an error message. Disabling auto-take status for a specific disk set causes the disk set to revert to normal behavior. That is, the disk set is potentially shared (non-concurrently) among hosts, and unavailable for mounting through \fB/etc/vfstab\fR.

.RS 4n
Force one of three actions to occur: takes ownership of a disk set when used with \fB-t\fR; deletes the last disk drive from the disk set; or deletes the last host from the disk set. Deleting the last drive or host from a disk set requires the \fB-d\fR option. 
.sp
When used to forcibly take ownership of the disk set, this causes the disk set to be grabbed whether or not another host owns the set. All of the disks within the set are taken over (reserved) and fail fast is enabled, causing the other host to panic if it had disk set ownership. The metadevice state database is read in by the host performing the take, and the shared metadevices contained in the set are accessible. 
.sp
You can use this option to delete the last drive in the disk set, because this drive would implicitly contain the last state database replica. 
.sp
You can use \fB-f\fR option to delete hosts from a set. When specified with a partial list of hosts, it can be used for one-host administration. One-host administration could be useful when a host is known to be non-functional, thus avoiding timeouts and failed commands. When specified with a complete list of hosts, the set is completely deleted. It is generally specified with a complete list of hosts to clean up after one-host administration has been performed.

The hostname is the nodename established by \fBsvc:/system/identity:node\fR \fBsmf\fR(5) service. Adding the first host creates the multi-owner disk set. A disk set can be created with just one host, with additional hosts added later. The last host cannot be deleted until all of the drives within the set have been deleted.
