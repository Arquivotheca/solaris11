.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBuseradd\fR adds a new user to the \fBpasswd\fR, \fBshadow\fR, and \fBuser_attr\fR databases in the \fBfiles\fR and \fBldap\fR repositories. The \fB-A\fR and \fB-P\fR options respectively assign authorizations and profiles to the user. The \fB-R\fR option assigns roles to a user. The \fB-p\fR option associates a project with a user. The \fB-K\fR option adds a \fIkey=value\fR pair to \fBuser_attr\fR entry for the user. Multiple \fIkey=value\fR pairs may be added with multiple \fB-K\fR options.
.sp
.LP
\fBuseradd\fR also creates supplementary group memberships for the user (\fB-G\fR option) and creates the home directory (\fB-m\fR option) for the user if requested. The new login remains locked until the \fBpasswd\fR(1) command is executed.
.sp
.LP
Specifying \fBuseradd\fR \fB-D\fR with the \fB-s\fR, \fB-k\fR,\fB-g\fR, \fB-b\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-A\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-R\fR, or \fB-K\fR option (or any combination of these options) sets the default values for the respective fields. See the \fB-D\fR option, below. Subsequent \fBuseradd\fR commands without the \fB-D\fR option use these arguments.
.sp
.LP
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 2048 characters per line. Specifying long arguments to several options can exceed this limit.
.sp
.LP
\fBuseradd\fR requires that usernames be in the format described in \fBpasswd\fR(4). A warning message is displayed if these restrictions are not met. See \fBpasswd\fR(4) for the requirements for usernames.
.sp
.LP
An administrator must be granted the User Management Profile to be able to create a new user. The authorizations required to set the various fields in \fBpasswd\fR, \fBshadow\fR and \fBuser_attr\fR can be found in \fBpasswd\fR(4), \fBshadow\fR(4), and \fBuser_attr\fR(4). The authorizations required to assign groups and projects can be found in \fBgroup\fR(4) and \fBproject\fR(4).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR \fIauthorization\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma-separated authorizations defined in \fBauth_attr\fR(4). Only a user or role who has \fBgrant\fR rights to the authorization can assign it to an account.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fIbase_dir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The base directory for new login home directories (see the \fB-d\fR option below. When a new user account is being created, \fIbase_dir\fR must already exist unless the \fB-m\fR option or the \fB-d\fR option is also specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcomment\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the user's full name. This information is stored in the user's \fBpasswd\fR entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the \fBauto_home\fR entry for the new user. The path \fB/home/\fR\fIusername\fR is entered in \fB/etc/passwd\fR. When the user subsequently references \fB/home/\fR\fIusername\fR, the automounter will mount the directory specified here on \fB/home/\fR\fIusername\fR.
.sp
The argument to the \fB-d\fR option can be specified as \fIserver\fR:\fIdir\fR where \fIserver\fR is the hostname of the machine on which the home directory resides and \fIdir\fR is the path to the user's home directory. If the server is a remote host, then the home directory needs to be created on the remote host for the system to mount it, when the user logs in. If no server name is specified then the home directory will be created on the host where the command is executed, when the \fB-m\fR option is used.
.RE

When used with the \fB-g\fR, \fB-b\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-A\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-R\fR, or \fB-K\fR options, the \fB-D\fR option sets the default values for the specified fields.

\fB\fB-e\fR \fIexpire\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the expiration date for a login. After this date, no user will be able to access this login. The expire option argument is a date entered using one of the date formats included in the template file \fB/etc/datemsk\fR. See \fBgetdate\fR(3C).
.sp
If the date format that you choose includes spaces, it must be quoted. For example, you can enter \fB10/6/90\fR or \fBOctober 6, 1990\fR. A null value (\fB" "\fR) defeats the status of the expired date. This option is useful for creating temporary logins.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-f\fR \fIinactive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

The maximum number of days allowed between uses of a login ID before that \fBID\fR is declared invalid. Normal values are positive integers. A value of \fB0\fR defeats the status.
.RE

.sp

.mk

\fB\fB-g\fR \fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An existing group's integer \fBID\fR or character-string name. Without the \fB-D\fR option, it defines the new user's primary group membership and defaults to the default group. You can reset this default value by invoking \fBuseradd\fR \fB-D\fR \fB-g\fR \fIgroup\fR. GIDs 0-99 are reserved for allocation by the Solaris Operating System.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-G\fR \fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An existing group's integer \fBID\fR or character-string name. It defines the new user's supplementary group membership. Duplicates between \fIgroup\fR with the \fB-g\fR and \fB-G\fR options are ignored. No more than \fBNGROUPS_MAX\fR groups can be specified. GIDs 0-99 are reserved for allocation by the Solaris Operating System.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-K\fR \fIkey=value\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fIkey=value\fR pair to add to the user's attributes. Multiple \fB-K\fR options may be used to add multiple \fIkey=value\fR pairs. The generic \fB-K\fR option with the appropriate key may be used instead of the specific implied key options (\fB-A\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-R\fR, \fB-p\fR). See \fBuser_attr\fR(4) for a list of valid \fIkey=value\fR pairs. The "type" key is not a valid key for this option. Keys may not be repeated. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIskel_dir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A directory that contains skeleton information (such as \fB\&.profile\fR) that can be copied into a new user's home directory. This directory must already exist. The system provides the \fB/etc/skel\fR directory that can be used for this purpose.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Create the new user's home directory if it does not already exist. If the directory already exists, it must have read, write, and execute permissions by \fIgroup\fR, where \fIgroup\fR is the user's primary group. If the server name specified to the \fB-d\fR option is a remote host then the system will not attempt to create the home directory.
.sp
If the directory does not already exist, a new ZFS dataset will be created.  In the global zone, the dataset is created as \fBrpool/export/home/\fR\fIusername\fR. For non-global zones, the dataset will be created as \fIROOT-dataset\fR\fB/export/home/\fR\fIusername\fR. The mountpoint for the ZFS dataset is \fB/export/home/\fR\fIusername\fR by default. If \fB-d\fR \fIpath\fR is specified and it is a path on the local machine, the dataset will be mounted at the specified location. The user is delegated permissions to create ZFS snapshots and promote them. The newly created dataset will inherit the encryption setting from its parent. If it is encrypted, the user is granted permission to change its wrapping key.

The \fBUID\fR defaults to the next available (unique) number above the highest number currently assigned. For example, if \fBUID\fRs 100, 105, and 200 are assigned, the next default \fBUID\fR number will be 201. \fBUID\fRs \fB0\fR-\fB99\fR are reserved for allocation by the Solaris Operating System.

The \fBuseradd\fR utility adds definitions to the \fBpasswd\fR, \fBshadow\fR, \fBgroup\fR, \fBproject\fR, and \fBuser_attr\fR databases in the scope (default or specified). It will verify the uniqueness of the user name (or role) and user id and the existence of any group names specified against the external name service.
