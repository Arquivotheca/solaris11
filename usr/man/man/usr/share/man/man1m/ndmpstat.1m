.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBndmpstat\fR utility reports Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) statistics, among which are NDMP worker threads, disk IO, tape IO, files operation, performance, and backup activity.
.sp
.LP
\fBndmpstat\fR reports the aggregate statistics for all tapes and disks. In order to obtain statistics for specific tape devices, the tape device name should be passed as argument to the utility.
.sp
.LP
When invoked, \fBndmpstat\fR begins its display with a one-line summary of the NDMP daemon activity since the NDMP service was invoked.
