.SH NAME
in.rarpd, rarpd \- DARPA Reverse Address Resolution Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rarpd\fR starts a daemon that responds to Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) requests. The daemon forks a copy of itself that runs in background. It must be run as root.
.sp
.LP
RARP is used by machines at boot time to discover their Internet Protocol (IP) address. The booting machine provides its Ethernet address in a \fBRARP\fR request message. Using the \fBethers\fR and \fBhosts\fR databases, \fBin.rarpd\fR maps this Ethernet address into the corresponding \fBIP\fR address which it returns to the booting machine in an \fBRARP\fR reply message. The booting machine must be listed in both databases for \fBin.rarpd\fR to locate its \fBIP\fR address. \fBin.rarpd\fR issues no reply when it fails to locate an \fBIP\fR address.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.rarpd\fR uses the \fBSTREAMS-based\fR Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) message set to communicate directly with the datalink device driver.
