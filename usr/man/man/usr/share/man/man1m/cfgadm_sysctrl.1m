.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsysctrl\fR hardware specific library \fB/usr/platform/sun4u/lib/cfgadm/sysctrl.so.1\fR provides dynamic reconfiguration functionality for configuring and disconnecting system boards on \fBE6X00\fR, \fBE5X00\fR, \fBE4X00\fR, and \fBE3X00\fR systems. You can insert both \fBI/O\fR and \fBCPU\fR boards into a slot on a running system that is configured for Solaris without rebooting. You can also disconnect and remove both types of boards from a running system without rebooting. 
.sp
.LP
System slots appear as attachment points in the device tree, one attachment point for each actual slot in the system chassis. If a board is not in a slot, the receptacle state is \fBempty\fR. If a board is powered-off and ready to remove, the receptacle state is \fBdisconnected\fR. If a board is powered-on and is connected to the system bus, the receptacle state is \fBconnected\fR.
.sp
.LP
 The occupant state is \fBunconfigured\fR when the receptacle state is \fBempty\fR or \fBdisconnected\fR. The occupant state is either \fBunconfigured\fR or \fBconfigured\fR when the receptacle state is \fBconnected\fR. 
.sp
.LP
In the \fBconfigured\fR state the devices on a board are available for use by Solaris. In the \fBunconfigured\fR state, the devices on the board are not. 
.sp
.LP
Inserting a board changes the receptacle state from \fBempty\fR to \fBdisconnected\fR. Removing a board changes the receptacle state from \fBdisconnected\fR to \fBempty\fR. Removing a board that is in the \fBconnected\fR state crashes the operating system and can result in permanent damage to the system. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBcfgadm\fR(1M) for a more complete description options.
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIfunction\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Perform the state change function. Specify \fIfunction\fR as \fBconnect\fR, \fBdisconnect\fR, \fBconfigure\fR or \fBunconfigure\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconfigure\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Change the occupant state to \fBconfigure\fR. 
.sp
If the receptacle state is \fBdisconnect\fRed, the \fBconfigure\fR function first attempts to connect the receptacle. The \fBconfigure\fR function walks the \fBOBP\fR device tree created as part of the \fBconnect\fR function and creates the Solaris device tree nodes, attaching devices as required. For \fBCPU\fR/Memory boards, \fBconfigure\fR adds \fBCPU\fRs to the \fBCPU\fR list in the \fBpowered-off \fRstate. These are visible to the \fBpsrinfo\fR(1M) and \fBpsradm\fR(1M) commands. Two memory attachment points are published for CPU/memory boards. Use \fBmount\fR(1M) and\fBifconfig\fR(1M) to use \fBI/O\fR devices on the new board. To use \fBCPU\fRs, use \fBpsradm\fR \fB-n\fR to on-line the new processors. Use \fBcfgadm_ac\fR(1M) to test and configure the memory banks. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBconnect\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Change the receptacle state to \fBconnect\fRed. 
.sp
Changing the receptacle state requires that the system bus be frozen while the bus signals are connected and the board tested. The bus is frozen by running a \fBquiesce\fR operation which stops all process activity and suspends all drivers. Because the \fBquiesce\fR operation and the subsequent resume can be time consuming, and are not supported by all drivers, the \fB-x\fR \fBquiesce-test\fR is provided. While the system bus is frozen, the board being connected is tested by firmware. This operation takes a short time for \fBI/O\fR boards and a significant time for \fBCPU\fR/Memory boards due to CPU external cache testing. This does not provide memory testing. The user is prompted for confirmation before proceeding with the \fBquiesce\fR. Use the \fB-y\fR or \fB-n\fR option to override the prompt. The \fBconnect\fR operation is refused if the board is marked as \fBdisabled-at-boot\fR, unless either the force flag, \fB-f\fR, or the enable at boot flag, \fB-o\fR \fBenable-at-boot\fR, is given. See \fB-l\fR.

\fBdisconnect\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
 Change the receptacle state to \fBdisconnect\fRed. 
.sp
If the occupant state is \fBconfigure\fR, the \fBdisconnect\fR function first attempts to unconfigure the occupant. The \fBdisconnect\fR operation does not require a \fBquiesce\fR operation and operates quickly. The board is powered-off ready for removal. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBunconfigure\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Change the occupant state to \fBunconfigure\fRed. 
.sp
Devices on the board are made invisible to Solaris during this process. The \fBI/O\fR devices on an \fBI/O\fR board are removed from the Solaris device tree. Any device that is still in use stops the unconfigure process and be reported as in use. The unconfigure operation must be retried after the device is made non-busy. For \fBCPU\fR/Memory boards, the memory must have been changed to the unconfigured state prior to issuing the board unconfigure operation. The \fBCPU\fRs on the board are off-lined, powered off and removed from the Solaris \fBCPU\fR list. \fBCPU\fRs that have processes bound to them cannot be off-lined. See \fBpsradm\fR(1M), \fBpsrinfo\fR(1M), \fBpbind\fR(1M), and\fBp_online\fR(2) for more information on off-lining \fBCPU\fRs.

.sp
Allows the \fBquiesce\fR operation required for board connect operations to be exercised. The execution of this test confirms that, with the current software and hardware configuration, it is possible to quiesce the system. If a device or process cannot be quiesced, its name is printed in an error message. Any valid board attachment point can be used with this command, but since all systems have a slot1 the given form is recommended.
