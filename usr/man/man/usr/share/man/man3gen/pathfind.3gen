.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpathfind()\fR function searches the directories named in \fIpath\fR for the file \fIname\fR. The directories named in \fIpath\fR are separated by colons (:). The \fImode\fR argument is a string of option letters chosen from the set \fB[rwxfbcdpugks]:\fR

.sp
.LP
Options read, write, and execute are checked relative to the real (not the effective) user \fBID\fR and group \fBID\fR of the current process.
.sp
.LP
If \fIname\fR begins with a slash, it is treated as an absolute path name, and \fIpath\fR is ignored.
.sp
.LP
An empty \fIpath\fR member is treated as the current directory. A slash (\fB/\fR) character is not prepended at the occurrence of the first match; rather, the unadorned \fIname\fR is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRExample of finding the \fBls\fR command using the PATH environment variable.
.sp
.LP
To find the \fBls\fR command using the \fBPATH\fR environment variable:

.sp
.LP
pathfind (getenv ("PATH"), "ls", "rx") 

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBpathfind()\fR function returns a \fB(char *)\fR value containing static, thread-specific data that will be overwritten upon the next call from the same thread.
.sp
.LP
If the file \fIname\fR with all characteristics specified by \fImode\fR is found in any of the directories specified by \fIpath\fR, then \fBpathfind()\fR returns a pointer to a string containing the member of \fIpath\fR, followed by a slash character (\fB/\fR), followed by \fIname\fR.
.sp
.LP
If no match is found, \fBpathname()\fR returns a null pointer, \fB((char *) 0)\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The string pointed to by the returned pointer is stored in an area that is reused on subsequent calls to \fBpathfind()\fR. The string should not be deallocated by the caller.
.sp
.LP
When compiling multithreaded applications, the \fB_REENTRANT\fR flag must be defined on the compile line.  This flag should only be used in  multithreadedapplications.
