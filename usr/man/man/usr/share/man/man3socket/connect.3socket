.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The parameter \fIs\fR is a socket. If it is of type \fBSOCK_DGRAM\fR, \fBconnect()\fR specifies the peer with which the socket is to be associated. This address is the address to which datagrams are to be sent if a receiver is not explicitly designated. This address is the only address from which datagrams are to be received. If the socket \fIs\fR is of type \fBSOCK_STREAM\fR, \fBconnect()\fR attempts to make a connection to another socket. This  behavior  can  be  modified  by the \fBSO_PASSIVE_CONNECT\fR socket option provided by \fBsetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET). The other socket is specified by \fIname\fR, which is an address in the communication space of the socket. Each communication space interprets the \fIname\fR parameter in its own way. If \fIs\fR is not bound, then \fIs\fR will be bound to an address selected by the underlying transport provider. Generally, stream sockets can successfully \fBconnect()\fR only once. Datagram sockets can use \fBconnect()\fR multiple times to change their association. Datagram sockets can dissolve the association by connecting to a null address.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the connection or binding succeeds, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned, \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error, and state of the socket is unspecified. Applications should close the file descriptor and create a new socket before attempting to reconnect.
