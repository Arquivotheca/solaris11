.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrcmd()\fR function is used by the superuser to execute a command on a remote machine with an authentication scheme based on reserved port numbers. An \fBAF_INET\fR socket is returned with \fBrcmd()\fR. The \fBrcmd_af()\fR function supports \fBAF_INET\fR, \fBAF_INET6\fR or \fBAF_UNSPEC\fR for the address family. An application can choose which type of socket is returned by passing \fBAF_INET\fR or \fBAF_INET6\fR as the address family. The use of \fBAF_UNSPEC\fR means that the caller will accept any address family. Choosing \fBAF_UNSPEC\fR provides a socket that best suits the connectivity to the remote host.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrresvport()\fR function returns a descriptor to a socket with an address in the privileged port space. The \fBrresvport_af()\fR function is the equivalent to \fBrresvport()\fR, except that you can choose \fBAF_INET\fR or \fBAF_INET6\fR as the socket address family to be returned by \fBrresvport_af()\fR. \fBAF_UNSPEC\fR does not apply to the \fBrresvport()\fR function.
.sp
.LP
The \fBruserok()\fR function is a routine used by servers to authenticate clients that request as service with \fBrcmd\fR.
.sp
.LP
All of these functions are present in the same file and are used by the \fBin.rshd\fR(1M) server among others.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrcmd()\fR and \fBrcmd_af()\fR functions look up the host \fI*ahost\fR using \fBgetaddrinfo\fR(3SOCKET) and return \fB\(mi1\fR if the host does not exist. Otherwise, *\fIahost\fR is set to the standard name of the host and a connection is established to a server residing at the Internet port \fIinport\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of type \fBSOCK_STREAM\fR is returned to the caller. The socket is given to the remote command as standard input (file descriptor 0) and standard output (file descriptor 1). If \fIfd2p\fR is non-zero, an auxiliary channel to a control process is set up and a descriptor for it is placed in \fI*fd2p\fR. The control process returns diagnostic output file (descriptor 2) from the command on the auxiliary channel. The control process also accepts bytes on this channel as signal numbers to be forwarded to the process group of the command. If \fIfd2p\fR is 0, the standard error (file descriptor 2) of the remote command is made the same as its standard output. No provision is made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process, other than possibly sending out-of-band data.
.sp
.LP
The protocol is described in detail in \fBin.rshd\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The \fBrresvport()\fR and \fBrresvport_af()\fR functions are used to obtain a socket bound to a privileged port number. The socket is suitable for use by \fBrcmd()\fR and \fBrresvport_af()\fR and several other routines. Privileged Internet ports are those in the range 1 to 1023. Only the superuser is allowed to bind a socket to a privileged port number. The application must pass in \fIport\fR, which must be in the range 512 to 1023. The system first tries to bind to that port number.  If it fails, the system then tries to bind to another unused privileged port, if one is available. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBruserok()\fR function takes a remote host name returned by the \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR function with two user names and a flag to indicate whether the local user's name is that of the superuser. See \fBgethostbyname\fR(3NSL). The \fBruserok()\fR function then checks the files \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR and possibly \fB\&.rhosts\fR in the local user's home directory to see if the request for service is allowed. A \fB0\fR value is returned if the machine name is listed in the \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR file, or if the host and remote user name are found in the \fB\&.rhosts\fR file. Otherwise, the \fBruserok()\fR function returns \fB\(mi1\fR\&. If the superuser flag is \fB1\fR, the \fB/etc/hosts.equiv\fR is not checked.
.sp
.LP
The error code \fBEAGAIN\fR is overloaded to mean "All network ports in use."
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBrcmd()\fR and \fBrcmd_af()\fR functions return a valid socket descriptor upon success. The functions returns \fB\(mi1\fR upon error and print a diagnostic message to standard error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrresvport()\fR and \fBrresvport_af()\fR functions return a valid, bound socket descriptor upon success. The functions return \fB\(mi1\fR upon error with the global value \fIerrno\fR set according to the reason for failure.
