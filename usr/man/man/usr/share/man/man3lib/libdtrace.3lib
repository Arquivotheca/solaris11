.SH NAME
libdtrace \- DTrace dynamic tracing software library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Functions in this library define the interface for interacting with the DTrace dynamic tracing software, including the D language compiler and facilities for enabling probes and consuming trace data.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
The interfaces provided by libdtrace.so.1 are currently private to the implementation of the Solaris system and DTrace subsystem and are subject to change at any time without notice.  Applications using these interfaces might fail to run on future releases. Refer to the \fISolaris Dynamic Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented interfaces available for the DTrace facility.
