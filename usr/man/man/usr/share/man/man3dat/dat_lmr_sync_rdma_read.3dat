.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR function makes memory changes visible to an incoming RDMA Read operation. This operation guarantees consistency by locally flushing the non-coherent cache prior to it being retrieved by remote peer RDMA read operations.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR function is needed if and only if the Provider attribute specifies that this operation is needed prior to an incoming RDMA Read operation. The Consumer must call \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR after modifying data in a memory range in this region that will be the target of an incoming RDMA Read operation. The \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR function must be called after the Consumer has modified the memory range but before the RDMA Read operation begins. The memory range that will be accessed by the RDMA read operation must be supplied by the caller in the \fIlocal_segments\fR array. After this call returns, the RDMA Read operation can safely see the modified contents of the memory range. It is permissible to batch synchronizations for multiple RDMA Read operations in a single call by passing a \fIlocal_segments\fR array that includes all modified memory ranges. The \fIlocal_segments\fR entries need not contain the same LMR and need not be in the same Protection Zone.
.sp
.LP
If the Provider attribute specifying that this operation is required attempts to read from a memory range that is not properly synchronized using \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR, the returned contents are undefined.

\fB\fBDAT_INVALID_PARAMETER\fR\fR

.RS 25n

One of the parameters is invalid. For example, the address range for a local segment fell outside the boundaries of the corresponding Local Memory Region or the LMR handle was invalid.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Determining when an RDMA Read will start and what memory range it will read is the Consumer's responsibility. One possibility is to have the Consumer that is modifying memory call \fBdat_lmr_sync_rdma_read()\fR and then post a Send DTO message that identifies the range in the body of the Send. The Consumer wanting to perform the RDMA Read can receive this message and know when it is safe to initiate the RDMA Read operation.
.sp
.LP
This call ensures that the Provider receives a coherent view of the buffer contents upon a subsequent remote RDMA Read operation. After the call completes, the Consumer can be assured that all platform-specific buffer and cache updates have been performed, and that the LMR range has consistency with the Provider hardware. Any subsequent write by the Consumer can void this consistency. The Provider is not required to detect such access.
.sp
.LP
The action performed on the cache before the RDMA Read depends on the cache type:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
I/O noncoherent cache will be invalidated.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
CPU noncoherent cache will be flushed.
