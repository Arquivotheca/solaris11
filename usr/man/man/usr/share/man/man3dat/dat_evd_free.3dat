Handle for an instance of the Event Dispatcher.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_evd_free()\fR function destroys a specified instance of the Event Dispatcher.
.sp
.LP
All events on the queue of the specified Event Dispatcher are lost. The destruction of the Event Dispatcher instance does not have any effect on any DAT Objects that originated an Event Stream that had fed events to the Event Dispatcher instance. There should be no event streams feeding the Event Dispatcher and no threads blocked on the Event Dispatcher when the EVD is being closed as at the time when it was created.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed Event Dispatcher in any consequent operation fails.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBDAT_SUCCESS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The operation was successful.

\fB\fBDAT_INVALID_STATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Invalid parameter. There are Event Streams associated with the Event Dispatcher feeding it.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Consumers are advised to destroy all Objects that originate Event Streams that feed an instance of the Event Dispatcher before destroying it. An exception to this rule is Event Dispatchers of an IA.
.sp
.LP
Freeing an IA automatically destroys all Objects associated with it directly and indirectly, including Event Dispatchers.
