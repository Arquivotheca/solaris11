Handle for an instance of LMR to be destroyed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_lmr_free()\fR function destroys an instance of the LMR. The LMR cannot be destroyed if it is in use by an RMR. The operation does not deallocate the memory region or unpin memory on a host.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed LMR in any subsequent operation except for \fBdat_lmr_free()\fR fails. Any DTO operation that uses the destroyed LMR after the \fBdat_lmr_free()\fR is completed shall fail and report a protection violation. The use of \fIrmr_context\fR of the destroyed LMR by a remote peer for an RDMA DTO results in an error and broken connection on which it was used. Any remote RDMA operation that uses the destroyed LMR rmr_context\fI\fR, whose Transport-specific request arrived to the local host after the \fBdat_lmr_free()\fR has completed, fails and reports a protection violation. Remote RDMA operation that uses the destroyed LMR \fIrmr_context\fR, whose Transport-specific request arrived to the local host prior to the \fBdat_lmr_free()\fR returns, might or might not complete successfully. If it fails, \fBDAT_DTO_ERR_REMOTE_ACCESS\fR is reported in \fBDAT_DTO_COMPLETION_STATUS\fR for the remote RDMA DTO and the connection is broken.
