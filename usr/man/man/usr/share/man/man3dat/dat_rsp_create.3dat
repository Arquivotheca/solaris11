.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_rsp_create()\fR function creates a Reserved Service Point with the specified Endpoint that generates, at most, one Connection Request that is delivered to the specified Event Dispatcher in a Notification event.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The usage of a Reserve Service Point is as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The DAT Consumer creates a Local Endpoint and configures it appropriately.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The DAT Consumer creates a Reserved Service Point specifying the Local Endpoint.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The Reserved Service Point performs the following:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Collects native transport information reflecting a received Connection Request.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Creates a Pending Connection Request.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Creates a Connection Request Notice (event) that includes the Pending Connection Request (which includes, among others, Reserved Service Point Connection Qualifier, its Local Endpoint, and information about remote Endpoint).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Delivers the Connection Request Notice to the Consumer-specified target (CNO) \fIevd_handle\fR. The Local Endpoint is transitioned from Reserved to Passive Connection Pending state.
.RE
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Upon receiving a connection request, or at some time subsequent to that, the DAT Consumer must either \fBaccept()\fR or \fBreject()\fR the Pending Connection Request.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If accepted, the original Local Endpoint is now in a \fBConnected\fR state and fully usable for this connection, pending only native transport mandated RTU messages. This includes binding it to the IA port if that was not done previously. The Consumer is notified that the Endpoint is in a \fBConnected\fR state by a Connection Established Event on the Endpoint \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If rejected, the Local Endpoint point transitions into \fBUnconnected\fR state. The DAT Consumer can elect to destroy it or reuse it for other purposes.
