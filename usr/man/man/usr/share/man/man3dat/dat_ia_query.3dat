.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ia_query()\fR functions provides the Consumer with the IA parameters, as well as the IA and Provider attributes. Consumers pass in pointers to Consumer-allocated structures for the IA and Provider attributes that the Provider fills.
.sp
.LP
The \fIia_attr_mask\fR and \fIprovider_attr_mask\fR parameters allow the Consumer to specify which attributes to query. The Provider returns values for requested attributes. The Provider can also return values for any of the other attributes.
.SS "Interface Adapter Attributes"
.sp
.LP
The IA attributes are common to all open instances of the IA. DAT defines a method to query the IA attributes but does not define a method to modify them.
.sp
.LP
If IA is multiported, each port is presented to a Consumer as a separate IA.
