.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ep_modify()\fR function provides the Consumer a way to change parameters of an Endpoint.
.sp
.LP
The \fIep_param_mask\fR parameter allows Consumers to specify which parameters to modify. Providers modify values for \fIep_param_mask\fR requested parameters only.
.sp
.LP
Not all the parameters of the Endpoint can be modified. Some can be modified only when the Endpoint is in a specific state. The following list specifies which parameters can be modified and when they can be modified.
