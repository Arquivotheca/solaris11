.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A constructor the Registry calls on a Provider before the first call to \fBdat_ia_open\fR(3DAT) for a given IA name when the Provider is auto-loaded. An application that explicitly loads a Provider on its own can choose to use \fBdat_provider_init()\fR just as the Registry would have done for an auto-loaded Provider.
.sp
.LP
The Provider's implementation of this method must call \fBdat_registry_add_provider\fR(3DAT), using the IA name in the \fBprovider_info.ia_name\fR field, to register itself with the Dynamic Registry. The implementation must not register other IA names at this time. Otherwise, the Provider is free to perform any initialization it finds useful within this method.
.sp
.LP
This method is called before the first call to \fBdat_ia_open()\fR for a given IA name after one of the following has occurred:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The Provider library was loaded into memory.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The Registry called \fBdat_provider_fini\fR(3DAT) for that IA name.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The Provider called \fBdat_registry_remove_provider\fR(3DAT) for that IA name (but it is still the Provider indicated in the Static Registry).
.RE
.sp
.LP
If this method fails, it should ensure that it does not leave its entry in the Dynamic Registry.
