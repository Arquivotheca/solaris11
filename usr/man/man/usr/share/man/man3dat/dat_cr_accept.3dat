.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_cr_accept()\fR function establishes a Connection between the active remote side requesting Endpoint and the passive side local Endpoint. The local Endpoint is either specified explicitly by \fIep_handle\fR or implicitly by a Connection Request. In the second case, \fIep_handle\fR is \fBDAT_HANDLE_NULL\fR.
.sp
.LP
Consumers can specify private data that is provided to the remote side upon Connection establishment.
.sp
.LP
If the provided local Endpoint does not satisfy the requested Connection Request, the operation fails without any effect on the local Endpoint, Pending Connection Request, private data, or remote Endpoint.
.sp
.LP
The operation is asynchronous. The successful completion of the operation is reported through a Connection Event of type \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_ESTABLISHED\fR on the \fIconnect_evd\fR of the local Endpoint.
.sp
.LP
If the Provider cannot complete the Connection establishment, the connection is not established and the Consumer is notified through a Connection Event of type \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_ACCEPT_COMPLETION_ERROR\fR on the \fIconnect_evd\fR of the local Endpoint. It can be caused by the active side timeout expiration, transport error, or any other reason. If Connection is not established, Endpoint transitions into Disconnected state and all posted Recv DTOs are flushed to its \fIrecv_evd_handle\fR.
.sp
.LP
This operation, if successful, also destroys the Connection Request instance. Use of the handle of the destroyed \fIcr_handle\fR in any consequent operation fails.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Consumers should be aware that Connection establishment might fail in the following cases: If the accepting Endpoint has an outstanding RDMA Read outgoing attribute larger than the requesting remote Endpoint or outstanding RDMA Read incoming attribute, or if the outstanding RDMA Read incoming attribute is smaller than the requesting remote Endpoint or outstanding RDMA Read outgoing attribute.
.sp
.LP
Consumers should set the accepting Endpoint RDMA Reads as the target (incoming) to a number larger than or equal to the remote Endpoint RDMA Read outstanding as the originator (outgoing), and the accepting Endpoint RDMA Reads as the originator to a number smaller than or equal to the remote Endpoint RDMA Read outstanding as the target. DAT API does not define a protocol on how remote peers exchange Endpoint attributes. The exchange of outstanding RDMA Read incoming and outgoing attributes of EPs is left to the Consumer ULP. Consumer can use Private Data for it.
.sp
.LP
If the Consumer does not care about posting RDMA Read operations or remote RDMA Read operations on the connection, it can set the two outstanding RDMA Read attribute values to 0.
.sp
.LP
If the Consumer does not set the two outstanding RDMA Read attributes of the Endpoint, the Provider is free to pick up any value for default. The Provider can change these default values during connection setup.
