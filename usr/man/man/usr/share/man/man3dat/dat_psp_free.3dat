.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_psp_free()\fR function destroys a specified instance of the Public Service Point.
.sp
.LP
Any incoming Connection Requests for the Connection Qualifier on the destroyed Service Point it had been listening on are automatically rejected by the Provider with the return analogous to the no listening Service Point.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of the Connection Requests in progress is undefined and left to an implementation. But it must be consistent. This means that either a Connection Requested Event has been generated for the Event Dispatcher associated with the Service Point, including the creation of the Connection Request instance, or the Connection Request is rejected by the Provider without any local notification.
.sp
.LP
This operation shall have no effect on previously generated Connection Requested Events. This includes Connection Request instances and, potentially, Endpoint instances created by the Provider.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this operation with creation of a Service Point on the same Connection Qualifier at the same time is not defined. Consumers are advised to avoid this scenario.
.sp
.LP
Use of the handle of the destroyed Public Service Point in any consequent operation fails.
