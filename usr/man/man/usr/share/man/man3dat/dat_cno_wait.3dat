.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_cno_wait()\fR function allows the Consumer to wait for notification events from a set of Event Dispatchers all from the same Interface Adapter. The Consumer blocks until notified or the timeout period expires.
.sp
.LP
An Event Dispatcher that is disabled or in the "Waited" state does not deliver notifications. A uDAPL Consumer waiting directly upon an Event Dispatcher preempts the CNO.
.sp
.LP
The consumer can optionally specify a timeout, after which it is unblocked even if there are no notification events. On a timeout, \fIevd_handle\fR is explicitly set to a null handle.
.sp
.LP
The returned \fIevd_handle\fR is only a hint. Another Consumer can reap the Event before this Consumer can get around to checking the Event Dispatcher. Additionally, other Event Dispatchers feeding this CNO might have been notified. The Consumer is responsible for ensuring that all EVDs feeding this CNO are polled regardless of whether they are identified as the immediate cause of the CNO unblocking.
.sp
.LP
All the waiters on the CNO, including the OS Wait Proxy Agent if it is associated with the CNO, are unblocked with the NULL handle returns for an unblocking EVD \fIevd_handle\fR when the IA instance is destroyed or when all EVDs the CNO is associated with are freed.
