.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_psp_create()\fR function creates a persistent Public Service Point that can receive multiple requests for connection and generate multiple Connection Request instances that are delivered through the specified Event Dispatcher in Notification events.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_psp_create()\fR function is blocking. When the Public Service Point is created, \fBDAT_SUCCESS\fR is returned and \fIpsp_handle\fR contains a handle to an opaque Public Service Point Object.
.sp
.LP
There is no explicit backlog for a Public Service Point. Instead, Consumers can control the size of backlog through the queue size of the associated Event Dispatcher.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpsp_flags\fR parameter allows Consumers to request that the Provider create an implicit Endpoint for each incoming Connection Request, or request that the Provider should not create one per Connection Request. If the Provider cannot satisfy the request, the operation shall fail and \fBDAT_MODEL_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR is returned.
.sp
.LP
All Endpoints created by the Provider have \fBDAT_HANDLE_NULL\fR  for the Protection Zone and all Event Dispatchers. The Provider sets up Endpoint attributes to match the Active side connection request. The Consumer can change Endpoint parameters. Consumers should change Endpoint parameters, especially PZ and EVD, and are advised to change parameters for local accesses prior to the connection request acceptance with the Endpoint.
