.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_evd_set_unwaitable()\fR transitions the Event Dispatcher into an unwaitable state. In this state, calls to \fBdat_evd_wait\fR(3DAT) return synchronously with a \fBDAT_INVALID_STATE\fR error, and threads already blocked in \fBdat_evd_wait()\fR are awakened and return with a \fBDAT_INVALID_STATE\fR error without any further action by the Consumer. The actual state of the Event Dispatcher is accessible through \fBdat_evd_query\fR(3DAT) and is \fBDAT_EVD_UNWAITABLE\fR after the return of this operation.
.sp
.LP
This call does not affect a CNO associated with this EVD at all. Events arriving on the EVD after it is set unwaitable still trigger the CNO (if appropriate), and can be retrieved with \fBdat_evd_dequeue\fR(3DAT). Because events can arrive normally on the EVD, the EVD might overflow; the Consumer is expected to protect against this possibility.
