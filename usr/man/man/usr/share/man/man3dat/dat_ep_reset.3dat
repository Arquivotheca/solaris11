.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ep_reset()\fR function transitions the local Endpoint from a Disconnected to an Unconnected state.
.sp
.LP
The operation might cause the loss of any completions of previously posted DTOs and RMRs that were not dequeued yet.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ep_reset()\fR function is valid for both Disconnected and Unconnected states. For Unconnected state, the operation is no-op because the Endpoint is already in an Unconnected state. For an Unconnected state, the preposted Recvs are not affected by the call.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
If the Consumer wants to ensure that all Completions are dequeued, the Consumer can post DTO or RMR operations as a "marker" that are flushed to \fIrecv_evd_handle\fR or \fIrequest_evd_handle\fR. Now, when the Consumer dequeues the completion of the "marker" from the EVD, it is guaranteed that all previously posted DTO and RMR completions for the Endpoint were dequeued for that EVD. Now,  it is safe to reset the Endpoint without losing any completions.
