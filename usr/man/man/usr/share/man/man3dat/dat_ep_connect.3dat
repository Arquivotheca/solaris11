.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ep_connect()\fR function requests that a connection be established between the local Endpoint and a remote Endpoint. This operation is used by the active/client side Consumer of the Connection establishment model. The remote Endpoint is identified by Remote IA and Remote Connection Qualifier.
.sp
.LP
As part of the successful completion of this operation, the local Endpoint is bound to a Port Qualifier of the local IA. The Port Qualifier is passed to the remote side of the requested connection and is available to the remote Consumer in the Connection Request of the \fBDAT_CONNECTION_REQUEST_EVENT\fR.
.sp
.LP
The Consumer-provided \fIprivate_data\fR is passed to the remote side and is provided to the remote Consumer in the Connection Request. Consumers can encapsulate any local Endpoint attributes that remote Consumers need to know as part of an upper-level protocol. Providers can also provide a Provider on the remote side any local Endpoint attributes and Transport-specific information needed for Connection establishment by the Transport.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion of this operation, the local Endpoint is transferred into \fBDAT_EP_STATE_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_PENDING\fR.
.sp
.LP
Consumers can request a specific value of \fIqos\fR. The Provider specifies which quality of service it supports in documentation and in the Provider attributes. If the local Provider or Transport does not support the requested \fIqos\fR, the operation fails and \fBDAT_MODEL_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR is returned synchronously. If the remote Provider does not support the requested \fIqos\fR, the local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into the \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state, the connection is not established, and the event returned on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR is \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_NON_PEER_REJECTED\fR. The same \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_NON_PEER_REJECTED\fR event is returned if the connection cannot be established for all reasons of not establishing the connection, except timeout, remote host not reachable, and remote peer reject. For example, remote Consumer is not listening on the requested Connection Qualifier, Backlog of the requested Service Point is full, and Transport errors. In this case, the local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state.
.sp
.LP
The acceptance of the requested connection by the remote Consumer is reported to the local Consumer through a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_ESTABLISHED\fR event on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the local Endpoint and the local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_CONNECTED\fR state.
.sp
.LP
The rejection of the connection by the remote Consumer is reported to the local Consumer through a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_PEER_REJECTED\fR event on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the local Endpoint and the local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state.
.sp
.LP
When the Provider cannot reach the remote host or the remote host does not respond within the Consumer requested Timeout, a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_UNREACHABLE\fR event is generated on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the Endpoint. The Endpoint transitions into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state.
.sp
.LP
If the Provider can locally determine that the \fIremote_ia_address\fR is invalid, or that the remote_ia_address cannot be converted to a Transport-specific address, the operation can fail synchronously with a \fBDAT_INVALID_ADDRESS\fR return.
.sp
.LP
The local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_CONNECTED\fR state when a Connection Request accepted by the remote Consumer and the Provider completes the Transport-specific Connection establishment. The local Consumer is notified of the established connection through a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_ESTABLISHED\fR event on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the local Endpoint.
.sp
.LP
When the \fItimeout\fR expired prior to completion of the Connection establishment, the local Endpoint is automatically transitioned into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state and the local Consumer through a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_TIMED_OUT\fR event on the \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the local Endpoint.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
It is up to the Consumer to negotiate outstanding RDMA Read incoming and outgoing with a remote peer. The outstanding RDMA Read outgoing attribute should be smaller than the remote Endpoint outstanding RDMA Read incoming attribute. If this is not the case, Connection establishment might fail.
.sp
.LP
DAT API does not define a protocol on how remote peers exchange Endpoint attributes. The exchange of outstanding RDMA Read incoming and outgoing attributes of EPs is left to the Consumer ULP. The Consumer can use Private Data for it.
.sp
.LP
If the Consumer does not care about posting RDMA Read operations or remote RDMA Read operations on the connection, it can set the two outstanding RDMA Read attribute values to 0.
.sp
.LP
If the Consumer does not set the two outstanding RDMA Read attributes of the Endpoint, the Provider is free to pick up any value for default. The Provider is allowed to change these default values during connection setup.
