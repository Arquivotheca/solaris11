.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdat_ep_disconnect()\fR function requests a termination of a connection or connection establishment. This operation is used by the active/client or a passive/server side Consumer of the connection model.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdisconnect_flags\fR parameter allows Consumers to specify whether they want graceful or abrupt disconnect. Upon disconnect, all outstanding and in-progress DTOs and RMR Binds must be completed.
.sp
.LP
For abrupt disconnect, all outstanding DTOs and RMR Binds are completed unsuccessfully, and in-progress DTOs and RMR Binds can be completed successfully or unsuccessfully. If an in-progress DTO is completed unsuccessfully, all follow on in-progress DTOs in the same direction also must be completed unsuccessfully. This order is presented to the Consumer through a DTO completion Event Stream of the \fIrecv_evd_handle\fR and and \fIrequest_evd_handle\fR of the Endpoint.
.sp
.LP
For graceful disconnect, all outstanding and in-progress request DTOs and RMR Binds must try to be completed successfully first, before disconnect proceeds. During that time, the local Endpoint is in a \fBDAT_EP_DISCONNECT_PENDING\fR state.
.sp
.LP
The Consumer can call abrupt \fBdat_ep_disconnect()\fR when the local Endpoint is in the \fBDAT_EP_DISCONNECT_PENDING\fR state. This causes the Endpoint to transition into \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR without waiting for outstanding and in-progress request DTOs and RMR Binds to successfully complete. The graceful \fBdat_ep_disconnect()\fR call when the local Endpoint is in the \fBDAT_EP_DISCONNECT_PENDING\fR state has no effect.
.sp
.LP
If the Endpoint is not in \fBDAT_EP_STATE_CONNECTED\fR, the semantic of the operation is the same for graceful or abrupt \fIdisconnect_flags\fR value.
.sp
.LP
No new Send, RDMA Read, and RDMA Write DTOs, or RMR Binds can be posted to the Endpoint when the local Endpoint is in the \fBDAT_EP_DISCONNECT_PENDING\fR state.
.sp
.LP
The successful completion of the disconnect is reported to the Consumer through a \fBDAT_CONNECTION_EVENT_DISCONNECTED\fR event on \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR of the Endpoint. The Endpoint is automatically transitioned into a \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR state upon successful asynchronous completion. If the same EVD is used for \fIconnect_evd_handle\fR and any \fIrecv_evd_handle\fR and request_evd_handle, all successful Completion events of in-progress DTOs precede the Disconnect Completion event.
.sp
.LP
Disconnecting an unconnected Disconnected Endpoint is no-op. Disconnecting an Endpoint in \fBDAT_EP_STATE_UNCONNECTED\fR, \fBDAT_EP_STATE_RESERVED\fR, \fBDAT_EP_STATE_PASSIVE_CONNECTION_PENDING\fR, and \fBDAT_EP_STATE_TENTATIVE_CONNECTION_PENDING\fR is disallowed.
.sp
.LP
Both abrupt and graceful disconnect of the Endpoint during connection establishment, \fBDAT_EP_STATE_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_PENDING\fR and \fBDAT_EP_STATE_COMPLETION_PENDING\fR, "aborts" the connection establishment and transitions the local Endpoint into \fBDAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED\fR. That causes preposted Recv DTOs to be flushed to \fIrecv_evd_handle\fR.
