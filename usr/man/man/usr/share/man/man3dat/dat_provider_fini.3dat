.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A destructor the Registry calls on a Provider before it disassociates the Provider from a given IA name.
.sp
.LP
The Provider can use this method to undo any initialization it performed when \fBdat_provider_init\fR(3DAT) was called for the same IA name. The Provider's implementation of this method should call \fBdat_registry_remove_provider\fR(3DAT) to unregister its IA Name. If it does not, the Registry might remove the entry itself.
.sp
.LP
This method can be called for a given IA name at any time after all open instances of that IA are closed, and is certainly called before the Registry unloads the Provider library. However, it is not called more than once without an intervening call to \fBdat_provider_init()\fR for that IA name.
