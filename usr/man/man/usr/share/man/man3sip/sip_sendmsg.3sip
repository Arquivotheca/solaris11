#include <sip.h>

\fBint\fR \fIsip_sendmsg\fR(\fBsip_conn_object_t\fR \fIobj\fR, \fBsip_msg_t\fR \fIsip_msg\fR,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsip_sendmsg()\fR function is used to send an outbound \fBSIP\fR message \fIsip_msg\fR to the \fBSIP\fR stack on its way to the peer. The connection object for the \fBSIP\fR message is passed as \fIobj\fR. The caller also provides the dialog associated with the message, if one exists. The value of flags is the result of ORing the following, as required:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSIP_SEND_STATEFUL\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Send the request or response statefully. This results in the stack creating and maintaining a transaction for this request/response. If this flag is not set transactions are not created for the request/response.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBSIP_DIALOG_ON_FORK\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
When this flag is set, the stack may create multiple dialogs for a dialog completing response. This may result due to forking of the dialog creating request. If this flag is not set, the first response to a dialog creating request creates a dialog, but subsequent ones do not. It is only meaningful if the stack is configured to maintain dialogs.
