.TH wctype 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wctype \- define character class
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBwctype_t\fR \fBwctype\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIcharclass\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwctype()\fR function is defined for valid character class names as defined in the current locale. The \fIcharclass\fR is a string identifying a generic character class for which codeset-specific type information is required. The following character class names are defined in all locales:
.sp

.sp
.TS
tab();
lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) 
lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) 
.
alnumalphablank
cntrldigitgraph
lowerprintpunct
spaceupperxdigit
.TE

.sp
.LP
Additional character class names defined in the locale definition file (category \fBLC_CTYPE\fR) can also be specified.
.sp
.LP
The function returns a value of type \fBwctype_t\fR, which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of \fBiswctype\fR(3C). \fBwctype()\fR determines values of \fBwctype_t\fR according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character type information in the program's locale (category \fBLC_CTYPE\fR). The values returned by \fBwctype()\fR are valid until a call to \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) that modifies the category \fBLC_CTYPE\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwctype()\fR function returns \fB0\fR if the given character class name is not valid for the current locale (category \fBLC_CTYPE\fR); otherwise it returns an object of type \fBwctype_t\fR that can be used in calls to \fBiswctype()\fR.
