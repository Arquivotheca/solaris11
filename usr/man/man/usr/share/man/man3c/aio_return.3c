.TH aio_return 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
aio_return \- retrieve return status of an asynchronous I/O operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <aio.h>

\fBssize_t\fR \fBaio_return\fR(\fBstruct aiocb *\fR\fIaiocbp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaio_return()\fR function returns the return status associated with the \fBaiocb\fR structure referenced by the \fIaiocbp\fR argument. The return status for an asynchronous I/O operation is the value that would be returned by the corresponding \fBread\fR(2), \fBwrite\fR(2), or \fBfsync\fR(3C) function call. If the error status for the operation is equal to \fBEINPROGRESS\fR, then the return status for the operation is undefined. The \fBaio_return()\fR function may be called exactly once to retrieve the return status of a given asynchronous operation; thereafter, if the same \fBaiocb\fR structure is used in a call to \fBaio_return()\fR or \fBaio_error\fR(3C), an error may be returned. When the \fBaiocb\fR structure referred to by \fIaiocbp\fR is used to submit another asynchronous operation, then \fBaio_return()\fR may be successfully used to retrieve the return status of that operation.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the asynchronous I/O operation has completed, then the return status, as described for \fBread\fR(2), \fBwrite\fR(2), and \fBfsync\fR(3C), is returned. If the asynchronous I/O operation has not yet completed, the results of \fBaio_return()\fR are undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBaio_return()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIaiocbp\fR argument does not refer to an asynchronous operation whose return status has not yet been retrieved.

\fB\fBENOSYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBaio_return()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBaio_return()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
