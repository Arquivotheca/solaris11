.SH NAME
pthread_barrierattr_getpshared, pthread_barrierattr_setpshared \- get and set process-shared attribute of barrier attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_barrierattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpshared\fR);

     \fBint\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_barrierattr_getpshared()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. The \fBpthread_barrierattr_setpshared()\fR function sets the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is set to \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED\fR to permit a barrier to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the barrier is allocated. If the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR, the barrier will only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized the barrier. If threads of different processes attempt to operate on such a barrier, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The default value of the attribute is \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR. Both constants \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED\fR and \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR are defined in <\fBpthread.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
No barrier attributes other than the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute are provided.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_barrierattr_getpshared()\fR function returns 0 and stores the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpshared\fR parameter.  Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_barrierattr_setpshared()\fR function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
