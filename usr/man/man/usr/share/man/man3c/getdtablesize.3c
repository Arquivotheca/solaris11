.TH getdtablesize 3C "1 Mar 1996" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
getdtablesize \- get the file descriptor table size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBgetdtablesize\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetdtablesize()\fR function is equivalent to \fBgetrlimit\fR(2) with the \fBRLIMIT_NOFILE\fR option.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetdtablesize()\fR function returns the current soft limit as if obtained from a call to \fBgetrlimit()\fR with the \fBRLIMIT_NOFILE\fR option.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
There is no direct relationship between the value returned by \fBgetdtablesize()\fR and \fBOPEN_MAX\fR defined in <\fBlimits.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
Each process has a file descriptor table which is guaranteed to have at least 20 slots.  The entries in the descriptor table are numbered with small integers starting at 0. The \fBgetdtablesize()\fR function returns the current maximum size of this table by calling the \fBgetrlimit()\fR function.
