.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsftime()\fR function is equivalent to the \fBstrftime\fR(3C) function, except that:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument \fIwcs\fR points to the initial element of an array of wide-characters into which the generated output is to be placed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument \fImaxsize\fR indicates the maximum number of wide-characters to be placed in the output array.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The argument \fIformat\fR is a wide-character string and the conversion specifications are  replaced by corresponding sequences of wide-characters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The return value indicates the number of wide-characters placed in the output array.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the total number of resulting wide character  codes (including the terminating null wide-character code) is no more than \fImaxsize\fR, \fBwcsftime()\fR returns the number of wide-character codes  placed into the array pointed to by \fIwcs\fR, not including the terminating null wide-character code. Otherwise, \fB0\fR is returned and the contents of the array are indeterminate.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcfstime()\fR function uses \fBmalloc\fR(3C) and should \fBmalloc()\fR fail, \fBerrno\fR will be set by \fBmalloc()\fR.

The \fBwcsftime()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
