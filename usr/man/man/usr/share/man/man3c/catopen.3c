.SH NAME
catopen, catclose \- open/close a message catalog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

#include <nl_types.h>

\fBnl_catd\fR \fBcatopen\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR, \fBint\fR \fIoflag\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBcatclose\fR(\fBnl_catd\fR \fIcatd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatopen()\fR function opens a message catalog and returns a message catalog descriptor. \fIname\fR specifies the name of the message catalog to be opened. If \fIname\fR contains a "/", then  \fIname\fR specifies a complete pathname for the message catalog; otherwise, the environment variable \fBNLSPATH\fR is used and  \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/LC_MESSAGES\fR must exist. If \fBNLSPATH\fR does not exist in the environment, or if a message catalog cannot be opened in any of the paths specified by \fBNLSPATH\fR, then the default path \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fIlocale\fR/LC_MESSAGES\fR is used. In the "C" locale,  \fBcatopen()\fR will always succeed without checking the default search path.
.sp
.LP
The names of message catalogs and their location in the filesystem can vary from one system to another. Individual applications can choose to name or locate message catalogs according to their own special needs. A mechanism is therefore required to specify where the catalog resides.
.sp
.LP
The \fBNLSPATH\fR variable provides both the location of message catalogs, in the form of a search path, and the naming conventions associated with message catalog files.  For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
NLSPATH=/nlslib/%L/%N.cat:/nlslib/%N/%L 
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The metacharacter \fB%\fR introduces a substitution field, where \fB%L\fR substitutes the current setting of either the \fBLANG\fR environment variable, if the value of \fIoflag\fR is  \fB0\fR, or the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category, if the value of \fIoflag\fR is  \fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR, and  \fB%N\fR substitutes the value of the \fIname\fR parameter passed to \fBcatopen()\fR. Thus, in the above example, \fBcatopen()\fR will search in  \fB/nlslib/$LANG/\fIname\fR.cat\fR, if \fIoflag\fR is \fB0\fR, or in \fB/nlslib/{LC_MESSAGES}/\fIname\fR.cat\fR, if \fIoflag\fR is \fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBNLSPATH\fR variable will normally be set up on a system wide basis (in \fB/etc/profile\fR) and thus makes the location and naming conventions associated with message catalogs transparent to both programs and users.
.sp

The full set of metacharacters is:

The \fBLANG\fR environment variable provides the ability to specify the user's requirements for native languages, local customs and character set, as an ASCII string in the form
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=language_territory.codeset[@modifier]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
A user who speaks German as it is spoken in Austria and has a terminal which operates in UTF-8 codeset, would want the setting of the LANG variable to be
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=de_AT.UTF-8
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
With this setting it should be possible for that user to find any  relevant catalogs should they exist.
.sp
.LP
Should the \fBLANG\fR variable not be set, the value of \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR as returned by \fBsetlocale()\fR is used.  If this is \fINULL,\fR the default path as defined in <\fBnl_types.h\fR> is used.
.sp
.LP
A message catalogue descriptor remains valid in a process until that process closes it, or a successful call to one of the \fBexec\fR functions. A change in the setting of the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category may invalidate existing open catalogues.
.sp
.LP
If a file descriptor is used to implement message catalogue descriptors, the \fBFD_CLOEXEC\fR flag will be set; see <\fBfcntl.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIoflag\fR argument is \fB0\fR, the  \fBLANG\fR environment variable is used to locate the catalogue without regard to the  \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category.  If the \fIoflag\fR argument is \fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR, the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category is used to locate the message catalogue.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR that is used in the process of locating message catalog is a canonical locale name to obsoleted Solaris locale names as described in \fBlocale_alias\fR(5) and the above mentioned ordinary locations with the value do not yield a message catalog, for a better backward compatibility, \fBcatopen()\fR additionally looks for its message catalog using the obsoleted Solaris locale names as the additional locale names to check on with in place of the value.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR that is used in the process of locating message catalog is an accepted and supported locale name alias to a canonical locale name that is supported as described in \fBlocale_alias\fR(5) and the above  mentioned ordinary locations with the value do not yield a message catalog, \fBcatopen()\fR additionally looks for its message catalog using the canonical locale name.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatclose()\fR function closes the message catalog identified by \fIcatd\fR. If a file descriptor is used to implement the type \fBnl_catd\fR, that file descriptor will be closed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcatopen()\fR returns a message catalog descriptor for use on  subsequent calls to  \fBcatgets()\fR and \fBcatclose()\fR. Otherwise it returns \fB(nl_catd) \(mi1\fR.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcatclose()\fR returns 0. Otherwise it returns \(mi1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
