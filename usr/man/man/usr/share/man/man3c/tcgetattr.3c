.TH tcgetattr 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcgetattr \- get the parameters associated with the terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcgetattr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBstruct termios *\fR\fItermios_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR function gets the parameters associated with the terminal referred to by \fIfildes\fR and stores them in the \fBtermios\fR structure (see \fBtermio\fR(7I)) referenced by \fItermios_p\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fItermios_p\fR argument is a pointer to a \fBtermios\fR structure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR operation is allowed from any process.
.sp
.LP
If the terminal device supports different input and output baud rates, the baud rates stored in the \fBtermios\fR structure returned by \fBtcgetattr()\fR reflect the actual baud rates, even if they are equal. If differing baud rates are not supported, the rate returned as the output baud rate is the actual baud rate. If the terminal device does not support split baud rates, the input baud rate stored in the \fBtermios\fR structure will be 0.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
