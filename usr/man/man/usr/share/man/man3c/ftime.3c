.SH NAME
ftime \- get date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/timeb.h>

\fBint\fR \fBftime\fR(\fBstruct timeb *\fR\fItp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftime()\fR function sets the \fBtime\fR and \fBmillitm\fR members of the \fBtimeb\fR structure pointed to by \fItp\fR. The structure is defined in <\fBsys/timeb.h\fR> and contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
time_t           time;
unsigned short   millitm;
short            timezone;
short            dstflag;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBtime\fR and \fBmillitm\fR members contain the seconds and milliseconds portions, respectively, of the current time in seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), January 1, 1970.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimezone\fR member contains the local time zone. The \fBdstflag\fR member contains a flag that, if non-zero, indicates that Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.
.sp
.LP
The contents of the \fBtimezone\fR and \fBdstflag\fR members of \fItp\fR after a call to \fBftime()\fR are unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBftime()\fR function returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise \fB\(mi1\fR is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
For portability to implementations conforming to earlier versions of this document, \fBtime\fR(2) is preferred over this function.
.sp
.LP
The millisecond value usually has a granularity greater than one due to the resolution of the system clock.  Depending on any granularity (particularly a granularity of one) renders code non-portable.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
