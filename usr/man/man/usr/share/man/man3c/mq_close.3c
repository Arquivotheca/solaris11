.TH mq_close 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mq_close \- close a message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <mqueue.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBmq_close\fR(\fBmqd_t\fR \fImqdes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmq_close()\fR function removes the association between the message queue descriptor, \fImqdes\fR, and its message queue. The results of using this message queue descriptor after successful return from this \fBmq_close()\fR, and until the return of this message queue descriptor from a subsequent \fBmq_open\fR(3C), are undefined.
.sp
.LP
If the process (or thread) has successfully attached a notification request to the message queue via this \fImqdes\fR, this attachment is removed and the message queue is available for another process to attach for notification.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmq_close()\fR returns \fB0\fR; otherwise, the function returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error condition.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBmq_close()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fImqdes\fR argument is an invalid message queue descriptor.

.SH NOTES

Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
