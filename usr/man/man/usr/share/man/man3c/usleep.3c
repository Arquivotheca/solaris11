.TH usleep 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
usleep \- suspend execution for interval in microseconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBusleep\fR(\fBuseconds_t\fR \fIuseconds\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBusleep()\fR function suspends the caller from execution for the number of microseconds specified by the \fIuseconds\fR argument. The actual suspension time might be less than requested because any caught signal will terminate \fBusleep()\fR following execution of that signal's catching routine. The suspension time might be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIuseconds\fR is 0, then the call has no effect.
.sp
.LP
The use of the \fBusleep()\fR function has no effect on the action or blockage of any signal. In a multithreaded process, only the invoking thread is suspended from execution.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On completion, \fBusleep()\fR returns \fB0\fR. There are no error returns.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are returned.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBusleep()\fR function is included for its historical usage.  The \fBnanosleep\fR(3C) function is preferred over this function.
