.TH sem_destroy 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_destroy \- destroy an unnamed semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_destroy\fR(\fBsem_t *\fR\fIsem\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_destroy()\fR function is used to destroy the unnamed semaphore indicated by \fIsem\fR. Only a semaphore that was created using \fBsem_init\fR(3C) may be destroyed using \fBsem_destroy()\fR; the effect of calling \fBsem_destroy()\fR with a named semaphore is undefined. The effect of subsequent use of the semaphore \fIsem\fR is undefined until \fIsem\fR is re-initialized by another call to \fBsem_init\fR(3C). 
.sp
.LP
It is safe to destroy an initialised semaphore upon which no threads are currently blocked. The effect of destroying a semaphore upon which other threads  are currently blocked is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBsem_destroy()\fR returns \fB0\fR, otherwise it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsem_destroy()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fIsem\fR argument is not a valid semaphore.
.RE

The \fBsem_destroy()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBUSY\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
There are currently processes (or LWPs or threads) blocked on the semaphore.
