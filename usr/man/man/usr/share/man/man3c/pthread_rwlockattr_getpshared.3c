.SH NAME
pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared, pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared \- get or set process-shared attribute of read-write lock attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.LP

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared\fR(\fBpthread_rwlockattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is set to  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED\fR to permit a read-write lock to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the read-write lock is allocated,  even if the read-write lock is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,\fR the read-write lock will only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that initialised the read-write lock; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a read-write lock, the behaviour is undefined. The default value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.\fR 
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute from the initialised attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. The  \fBpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()\fR function is used to set the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute in an initialised attributes object referenced by attr.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the  \fBpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the  \fBpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()\fR returns  \fB0\fR and stores the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpshared\fR parameter. Otherwise an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()\fR and \fBpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIattr\fR  or \fIpshared\fR is invalid.
