.TH mblen 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mblen \- get number of bytes in a character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBmblen\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmblen()\fR determines the number of bytes constituting the character pointed to by \fIs\fR. It is equivalent to:
.sp
.LP
\fBmbtowc((wchar_t *)0, \fR\fIs\fR, \fIn\fR);
.sp
.LP
A call with \fIs\fR as a null pointer causes this function to return \fB0\fR. The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, \fBmblen()\fR returns \fB0\fR. It \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmblen()\fR returns \fB0\fR (if \fIs\fR points to the null byte), the number of bytes that constitute the character (if the next \fIn\fR or fewer bytes form a valid character), or  \fB\(mi1\fR (if they do not form a valid character) and may set \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error. In no case will the value returned be greater than \fIn\fR or the value of the \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR macro.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmblen()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Invalid character sequence is detected.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBmblen()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
