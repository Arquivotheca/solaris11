.TH pthread_condattr_init 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_init, pthread_condattr_destroy \- initialize or destroy condition variable attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_init\fR(\fBpthread_condattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_destroy\fR(\fBpthread_condattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_condattr_init()\fR function initializes a condition variable attributes object \fIattr\fR with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the implementation.
.sp
.LP
At present, the only attribute available is the scope of condition variables. The default scope of the attribute is  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to initialize previously initialized condition variable attributes object will leave the storage allocated by the previous initialization unallocated.
.sp
.LP
After a condition variable attributes object has been used to initialize one or more condition variables, any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction) does not affect any previously initialized condition variables.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_condattr_destroy()\fR function destroys a condition variable attributes object; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause \fBpthread_condattr_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by \fIattr\fR to an invalid value. A destroyed condition variable attributes object can be re-initialized using \fBpthread_condattr_init()\fR; the results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
.sp
.LP
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the associated functions to get and set those attribute values are implementation-dependent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_condattr_init()\fR and \fBpthread_condattr_destroy()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_condattr_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the condition variable attributes object.
