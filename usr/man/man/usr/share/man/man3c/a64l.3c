.SH NAME
a64l, l64a \- convert between long integer and base-64 ASCII string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBlong\fR \fBa64l\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIs\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBchar *\fR\fBl64a\fR(\fBlong\fR \fIl\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions maintain numbers stored in base-64 \fBASCII\fR characters that define a notation by which long integers can be represented by up to six characters. Each character represents a "digit" in a radix-64 notation.
.sp
.LP
The characters used to represent "digits" are as follows:

The \fBa64l()\fR function takes a pointer to a null-terminated base-64 representation and returns a corresponding \fBlong\fR value.  If the string pointed to by \fIs\fR contains more than six characters, \fBa64l()\fR uses the first six.
.sp
.LP
The \fBa64l()\fR function scans the character string from left to right with the least significant digit on the left, decoding each character as a 6-bit radix-64 number.
.sp
.LP
The \fBl64a()\fR function takes a \fBlong\fR argument and returns a pointer to the corresponding base-64 representation. If the argument is 0, \fBl64a()\fR returns a pointer to a null string.
.sp
.LP
The value returned by \fBl64a()\fR is a pointer into a static buffer, the contents of which are overwritten by each call.  In the case of multithreaded applications, the return value is a pointer to thread specific data.
