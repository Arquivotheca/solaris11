.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwscanf()\fR function reads from the named input \fIstream\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwscanf()\fR function reads from the standard input stream \fBstdin\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBswscanf()\fR function reads from the wide-character string \fIs\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBvfwscanf()\fR, \fBvswscanf()\fR, and \fBvwscanf()\fR functions are equivalent to the \fBfwscanf()\fR, \fBswscanf()\fR, and \fBwscanf()\fR functions, respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined by the <\fBstdarg.h\fR> header . These functions do not invoke the \fBva_end()\fR macro. Applications using these functions should call \fBva_end\fR(\fIap\fR) afterwards to clean up.
.sp
.LP
Each function reads wide-characters, interprets them according to a format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a control wide-character string \fIformat\fR described below, and a set of \fIpointer\fR arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.
.sp
.LP
Conversions can be applied to the \fIn\fRth argument after the \fIformat\fR in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In this case, the conversion wide-character \fB%\fR (see below) is replaced by the sequence \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR, where \fIn\fR is a decimal integer in the range [1, \fBNL_ARGMAX\fR]. This feature provides for the definition of format wide-character strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages. In format wide-character strings containing the \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR form of conversion specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the format  wide-character string more than once.
.sp
.LP
The \fIformat\fR can contain either form of a conversion specification, that is, \fB%\fR or \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR, but the two forms cannot normally be mixed within a single \fIformat\fR wide-character string. The only exception to this is that \fB%%\fR or \fB%*\fR can be mixed with the \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR form.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwscanf()\fR function in all its forms allows for detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string, encoded as a wide-character value.  The  radix character is defined in the program's locale (category \fBLC_NUMERIC\fR). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character defaults to a period (.).
.sp
.LP
The format is a wide-character string composed of zero or more directives. Each directive is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space wide-characters (space, tab, newline,  vertical-tab or form-feed characters); an ordinary wide-character (neither \fB%\fR nor a white-space character); or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by a \fB%\fR or the sequence \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR after which the following appear in sequence:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional assignment-suppressing character \fB*\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An option length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A conversion specifier wide-character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion wide-characters are described below.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwscanf()\fR functions execute each directive of the format in turn.  If a directive fails, as detailed below, the function returns.  Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).
.sp
.LP
A directive composed of one or more white-space wide-characters is executed by reading input until no more valid input can be read, or up to the first wide-character which is not a white-space  wide-character, which remains unread.
.sp
.LP
A directive that is an ordinary wide-character is executed as follows. The next wide-character is read from the input and compared with the wide-character that comprises the directive; if the comparison shows that they are not equivalent, the directive fails, and the differing and subsequent wide-characters remain unread.
.sp
.LP
A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion  wide-character. A conversion specification is executed in the following steps:
.sp
.LP
Input white-space wide-characters (as specified by \fBiswspace\fR(3C)) are skipped, unless the conversion specification includes a \fB[\fR, \fBc\fR, or \fBn\fR conversion character.
.sp
.LP
An item is read from the input unless the conversion specification includes an \fBn\fR conversion wide-character. The length of the item read is limited to any specified maximum field width. In Solaris default mode, the input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide-characters that forms a matching sequence. In some cases, \fBfwscanf()\fR might need to read several extra wide-characters beyond the end of the input item to find the end of a matching sequence. In C99/SUSv3 mode, the input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide-characters that is, or is a prefix of, a matching sequence. With this definition, \fBfwscanf()\fR need only read at most one wide-character beyond the end of the input item. Therefore, in C99/SUSv3 mode, some sequences that are acceptable to \fBwcstod\fR(3C), \fBwcstol\fR(3C), and similar functions are unacceptable to \fBfwscanf()\fR. In either mode, \fBfwscanf()\fR attempts to push back any excess bytes read using \fBungetc\fR(3C). Assuming all such attempts succeed, the first wide-character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input item is 0, the conversion fails. This condition is a matching failure unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.
.sp
.LP
Except in the case of a \fB%\fR conversion wide-character, the input item (or, in the case of a \fB%\fR\fIn\fR conversion specification, the count of input wide-characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion wide-character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a \fB*\fR, the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following the \fIformat\fR argument that has not already received a conversion result if the conversion specification is introduced by \fB%\fR, or in the \fIn\fRth argument if introduced by the wide-character sequence \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR. If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.

If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated. If end-of-file occurs before any wide-characters matching the current conversion specification (except for \fB%n\fR) have been read (other than leading white-space, where permitted), execution of the current conversion specification terminates with an input failure.  Otherwise, unless execution of the current conversion specification is terminated with a matching failure, execution of the following conversion specification (if any) is terminated with an input failure.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The behavior of the conversion specifier "%%" has changed for all of the functions described on this manual page. Previously the "%%" specifier accepted a "%" character from input only if there were no preceding whitespace characters.  The new behavior accepts "%" even if there are preceding whitespace characters. This new behavior now aligns with the description on this manual page and in various standards. If the old behavior is desired, the conversion specification "%*[%]" can be used.
