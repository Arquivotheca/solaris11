.TH pthread_mutexattr_init 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_destroy \- initialize or destroy mutex attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_mutexattr_init\fR(\fBpthread_mutexattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_mutexattr_destroy\fR(\fBpthread_mutexattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_mutexattr_init()\fR function initializes a mutex attributes object \fIattr\fR with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the implementation.
.sp
.LP
The effect of initializing an already initialized mutex  attributes object is undefined.
.sp
.LP
After a mutex attributes object has been used to initialize one or more mutexes, any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction) does not affect any previously initialized mutexes.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_mutexattr_destroy()\fR function destroys a mutex attributes object; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause \fBpthread_mutexattr_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by \fIattr\fR to an invalid value. A destroyed mutex attributes object can be re-initialized using \fBpthread_mutexattr_init()\fR; the results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been  destroyed are undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_mutexattr_init()\fR and \fBpthread_mutexattr_destroy()\fR return \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_mutexattr_init()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the mutex attributes object.
.RE

The \fBpthread_mutexattr_destroy()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIattr\fR is invalid.
