.TH fputws 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fputws \- put wide character string on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBfputws\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBFILE *restrict\fR \fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfputws()\fR function writes a character string corresponding to the (null-terminated) wide character string pointed to by \fIws\fR to the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR. No character corresponding to the terminating null wide-character code is written, nor is a \fBNEWLINE\fR character appended.
.sp
.LP
The \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the file will be marked for update between the successful execution of \fBfputws()\fR and the next successful completion of a call to \fBfflush\fR(3C) or \fBfclose\fR(3C) on the same stream or a call to \fBexit\fR(2) or \fBabort\fR(3C). 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfputws()\fR returns a non-negative value. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR, sets an error indicator for the stream, and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfputwc\fR(3C).
