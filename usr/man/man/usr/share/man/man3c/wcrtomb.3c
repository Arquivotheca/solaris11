.TH wcrtomb 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wcrtomb \- convert a wide-character code to a character (restartable)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBwcrtomb\fR(\fBchar *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBmbstate_t *restrict\fR \fIps\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function is equivalent to the call:
.sp
.LP
wcrtomb(buf, L'\e0', ps)
.sp
.LP
where \fIbuf\fR is an internal buffer.
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function determines the number of bytes needed to represent the character that corresponds to the wide-character given by \fIwc\fR (including any shift sequences), and stores the resulting bytes in the array whose first element is pointed to by \fIs\fR. At most \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR bytes are stored.  If \fIwc\fR is a null wide-character, a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift sequence needed to restore the initial shift state. The resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, the \fBwcrtomb()\fR function uses its own internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object, which is initialized at program startup to the initial conversion state.   Otherwise, the  \fBmbstate_t\fR object pointed to by \fIps\fR is used to completely describe the current conversion state of the associated character sequence. Solaris will behave as if no function defined in the Solaris Reference Manual calls \fBwcrtomb()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcrtomb()\fR function returns the number of bytes stored in the array object (including any shift sequences).  When \fIwc\fR is not a valid wide-character, an encoding error occurs.  In this case, the function stores the value of the macros \fBEILSEQ\fR in \fBerrno\fR and returns \fB(size_t)\(mi1\fR; the conversion state is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcrtomb()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIps\fR argument points to an object that contains an invalid conversion state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Invalid wide-character code is detected.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is not a null pointer, \fBwcrtomb()\fR uses the \fBmbstate_t\fR object pointed to by \fIps\fR and the function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale. If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, \fBwcrtomb()\fR uses its internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object and the function is Unsafe in multithreaded applications.
