.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init \- destroy and initialize spawn file actions object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR);

     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR function destroys the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR. The object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation can cause \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file actions object can be reinitialized using \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR. The results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function initializes the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR to contain no file actions for \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C) to perform.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions object is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.
