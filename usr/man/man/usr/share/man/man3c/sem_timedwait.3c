.TH sem_timedwait 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_timedwait, sem_reltimedwait_np \- lock a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <time.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_timedwait\fR(\fBsem_t *restrict\fR \fIsem\fR,
     \fBconst struct timespec *restrict\fR \fIabs_timeout\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBsem_reltimedwait_np\fR(\fBsem_t *restrict\fR \fIsem\fR,
     \fBconst struct timespec *restrict\fR \fIrel_timeout\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_timedwait()\fR function locks the semaphore referenced by \fIsem\fR as in the \fBsem_wait\fR(3C) function. However, if the semaphore cannot be locked without waiting for another process or thread to unlock the semaphore by performing a \fBsem_post\fR(3C) function, this wait is terminated when the specified timeout expires.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_reltimedwait_np()\fR function is identical to the \fBsem_timedwait()\fR function, except that the timeout is specified as a relative time interval.
.sp
.LP
For \fBsem_timedwait()\fR, the timeout expires when the absolute time specified by \fIabs_timeout\fR passes, as measured by the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds \fIabs_timeout\fR), or if the absolute time specified by \fIabs_timeout\fR has already been passed at the time of the call.
.sp
.LP
For \fBsem_reltimedwait_np()\fR, the timeout expires when the time interval specified by \fIrel_timeout\fR passes, as measured by the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock, or if the time interval specified by \fIrel_timeout\fR is negative at the time of the call.
.sp
.LP
The resolution of the timeout is the resolution of the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock. The \fBtimespec\fR data type is defined as a structure in the <\fBtime.h\fR> header.
.sp
.LP
Under no circumstance does the function fail with a timeout if the semaphore can be locked immediately. The validity of the \fIabs_timeout\fR need not be checked if the semaphore can be locked immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_timedwait()\fR and \fBsem_reltimedwait_np()\fR functions return 0 if the calling process successfully performed the semaphore lock operation on the semaphore designated by \fIsem\fR. If the call was unsuccessful, the state of the semaphore is be unchanged and the function returns -1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_timedwait()\fR and \fBsem_reltimedwait_np()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
