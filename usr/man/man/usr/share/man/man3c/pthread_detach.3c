.TH pthread_detach 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_detach \- detach a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_detach\fR(\fBpthread_t\fR \fIthread\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_detach()\fR function is used to indicate to the implementation that storage for the thread \fIthread\fR can be reclaimed when that thread terminates. In other words,  \fBpthread_detach()\fR dynamically resets the  \fIdetachstate\fR attribute of the thread to \fBPTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED.\fR After a successful call to this function, it would not be necessary to reclaim the thread using  \fBpthread_join()\fR. See \fBpthread_join\fR(3C). If \fIthread\fR has not terminated, \fBpthread_detach()\fR will not cause it to terminate. The effect of multiple \fBpthread_detach()\fR calls on the same target thread is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBpthread_detach()\fR returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_detach()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The implementation has detected that the value specified by \fIthread\fR does not refer to a joinable thread.
