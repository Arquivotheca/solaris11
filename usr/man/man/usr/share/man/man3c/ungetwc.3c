.TH ungetwc 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
ungetwc \- push wide-character code back into input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBwint_t\fR \fBungetwc\fR(\fBwint_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBungetwc()\fR function pushes the character corresponding to the wide character code specified by \fIwc\fR back onto the input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR. The pushed-back characters will be returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR) to a file-positioning function ( \fBfseek\fR(3C), \fBfsetpos\fR(3C) or \fBrewind\fR(3C)) discards any pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
One character of push-back is guaranteed. If \fBungetwc()\fR is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIwc\fR equals that of the macro \fBWEOF\fR, the operation fails and the input stream is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
A successful call to \fBungetwc()\fR clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all pushed-back characters will be the same as it was before the characters were pushed back. The file-position indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each successful call to \fBungetwc()\fR; if its value was 0 before a call, its value is indeterminate after the call.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBungetwc()\fR returns the wide-character code corresponding to the pushed-back character. Otherwise it returns \fBWEOF\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBungetwc()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.
