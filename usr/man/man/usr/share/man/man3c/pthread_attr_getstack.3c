.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getstack, pthread_attr_setstack \- get or set stack attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS

cc \fB-mt\fR  [ \fIflag\fR\&.\|.\|. ] \fIfile\fR\&.\|.\|. \fB-lpthread\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR\&.\|.\|. ] 
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getstack\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBvoid **restrict\fR \fIstackaddr\fR, \fBsize_t *restrict\fR \fIstacksize\fR);

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setstack\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR \fIattr\fR, \fBvoid *\fR\fIstackaddr\fR,
     \fBsize_t\fR \fIstacksize\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_getstack()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_setstack()\fR functions, respectively, get and set the thread creation stack attributes \fIstackaddr\fR and \fIstacksize\fR in the \fIattr\fR object.
.sp
.LP
The stack attributes specify the area of storage to be used for the created thread's stack. The base (lowest addressable byte) of the storage is \fIstackaddr\fR, and the size of the storage is \fIstacksize\fR bytes. The \fIstacksize\fR argument must be at least {\fBPTHREAD_STACK_MIN\fR}. The \fIstackaddr\fR argument must be aligned appropriately to be used as a stack; for example, \fBpthread_attr_setstack()\fR might fail with \fBEINVAL\fR if (\fIstackaddr\fR & 0x7) is not 0. All pages within the stack described by \fIstackaddr\fR and \fIstacksize\fR are both readable and writable by the thread.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return a 0; otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_getstack()\fR function stores the stack attribute values in stackaddr and stacksize if successful.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setstack()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fIstacksize\fR is less than {\fBPTHREAD_STACK_MIN\fR}.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setstack()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The stack page(s) described by \fIstackaddr\fR and \fIstacksize\fR are not both readable and writable by the thread.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fIstackaddr\fR does not have proper alignment to be used as a stack, or (\fIstackaddr\fR + \fIstacksize\fR) lacks proper alignment.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
These functions are appropriate for use by applications in an environment where the stack for a thread must be placed in some particular region of memory.
