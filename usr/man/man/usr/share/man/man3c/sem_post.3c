.TH sem_post 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_post \- increment the count of a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_post\fR(\fBsem_t *\fR\fIsem\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_post()\fR function unlocks the semaphore referenced by \fIsem\fR by performing a semaphore unlock operation on that semaphore.
.sp
.LP
If the semaphore value resulting from this operation is positive, then no threads  were blocked waiting for the semaphore to become unlocked; the semaphore value is simply incremented.
.sp
.LP
If the value of the semaphore resulting from this operation is 0, then one of the threads  blocked waiting for the semaphore will be allowed to return successfully from its call to \fBsem_wait\fR(3C). If the symbol \fB_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING\fR is defined, the thread  to be unblocked will be chosen in a manner appropriate to the scheduling policies and parameters in effect for the blocked threads. In the case of the schedulers \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR and \fBSCHED_RR\fR, the highest priority waiting thread  will be unblocked, and if there is more than one highest priority thread  blocked waiting for the semaphore, then the highest priority thread that has been waiting the longest will be unblocked. If the symbol \fB_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING\fR is not defined, the choice of a thread  to unblock is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBsem_post()\fR returns \fB0\fR; otherwise it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_post()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The \fIsem\fR argument does not refer to a valid semaphore.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The \fBsem_post()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The semaphore value exceeds \fBSEM_VALUE_MAX\fR. 
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_post()\fR function is reentrant with respect to signals and may be invoked from a signal-catching function. The semaphore functionality described on this manual page is for the POSIX (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) threads implementation. For the documentation of the Solaris threads interface, see \fBsemaphore\fR(3C)).
