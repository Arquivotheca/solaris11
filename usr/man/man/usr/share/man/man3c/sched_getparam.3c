.TH sched_getparam 3C "1 Apr 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sched_getparam \- get scheduling parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsched_getparam\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR, \fBstruct sched_param *\fR\fIparam\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsched_getparam()\fR function returns the scheduling parameters of a process specified by \fIpid\fR in the \fBsched_param\fR structure pointed to by \fIparam\fR. The only required member of \fIparam\fR is \fIsched_priority\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a process specified by \fIpid\fR exists and if the calling process has permission, the scheduling parameters for the process whose process ID is equal to \fIpid\fR will be returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpid\fR is 0, the scheduling parameters for the calling process will be returned. The behavior of the \fBsched_getparam()\fR function is unspecified if the value of \fIpid\fR is negative.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBsched_getparam()\fR function returns \fB0\fR. If the call to \fBsched_getparam()\fR is unsuccessful, the function returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsched_getparam()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The requesting process does not have permission to obtain the scheduling parameters of the specified process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by \fIpid\fR.
