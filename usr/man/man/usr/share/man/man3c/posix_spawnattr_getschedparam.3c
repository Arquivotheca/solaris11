.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getschedparam, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam \- get and set spawn-schedparam attribute of spawn attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedparam\fR(\fBconst posix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBstruct sched_param *restrict\fR \fIschedparam\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedparam\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBconst struct sched_param *restrict\fR \fIschedparam\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedparam()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIspawn-schedparam\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedparam()\fR function sets the \fIspawn-schedparam\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspawn-schedparam\fR attribute represents the scheduling parameters to be assigned to the new process image in a spawn operation (if \fBPOSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER\fR or \fBPOSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM\fR is set in the \fIspawn-flags\fR attribute). The default value of this attribute is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedparam()\fR returns 0 and stores the value of the \fIspawn-schedparam\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIschedparam\fR parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedparam()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
