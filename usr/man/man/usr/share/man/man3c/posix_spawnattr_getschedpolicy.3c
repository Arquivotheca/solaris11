.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy, posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy \- get and set spawn-schedpolicy attribute of spawn attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy\fR(
     \fBconst posix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIschedpolicy\fR);
.fi

.LP

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fIschedpolicy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIspawn-schedpolicy\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy()\fR function sets the \fIspawn-schedpolicy\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspawn-schedpolicy\fR attribute represents the scheduling policy to be assigned to the new process image in a spawn operation (if \fBPOSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER\fR is set in the \fIspawn-flags\fR attribute). The default value of this attribute is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy()\fR returns 0 and stores the value of the \fIspawn-schedpolicy\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIschedpolicy\fR parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
