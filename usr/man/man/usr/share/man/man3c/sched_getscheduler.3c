.TH sched_getscheduler 3C "1 Apr 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sched_getscheduler \- get scheduling policy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsched_getscheduler\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function returns the scheduling policy of the process specified by \fIpid\fR. If the value of \fIpid\fR is negative, the behavior of the \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
The values that can be returned by \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR are defined in the header <\fBsched.h\fR> and described on the \fBsched_setscheduler\fR(3C) manual page.
.sp
.LP
If a process specified by \fIpid\fR exists and if the calling process has permission, the scheduling policy will be returned for the process whose process ID is equal to \fIpid\fR. 
.sp
.LP
If \fIpid\fR is 0, the scheduling policy will be returned for the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function returns the scheduling policy of the specified process. If unsuccessful, the function returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The requesting process does not have permission to determine the scheduling policy of the specified process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by \fIpid\fR.
