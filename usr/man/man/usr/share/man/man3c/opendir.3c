.TH opendir 3C "26 Jun 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
opendir, fdopendir \- open directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>

\fBDIR *\fR\fBopendir\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIdirname\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBDIR *\fR\fBfdopendir\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBopendir()\fR function opens a directory stream corresponding to the directory named by the \fIdirname\fR argument. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBfdopendir()\fR function opens a directory stream for the directory file descriptor \fIfildes\fR. The directory file descriptor should not be used or closed following a successful function call, as this might cause undefined results from future operations on the directory stream obtained from the call. Use \fBclosedir\fR(3C) to close a directory stream.
.sp
.LP
The directory stream is positioned at the first entry. If the type \fBDIR\fR is implemented using a file descriptor, applications will only be able to open up to a total of {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR} files and directories. A successful call to any of the \fBexec\fR functions will close any directory streams that are open in the calling process.  See \fBexec\fR(2).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBopendir()\fR and \fBfdopendir()\fR return a pointer to an object of type \fBDIR\fR. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBopendir()\fR and \fBfdopendir()\fR functions should be used in conjunction with \fBreaddir\fR(3C), \fBclosedir\fR(3C) and \fBrewinddir\fR(3C) to examine the contents of the directory (see the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section in \fBreaddir\fR(3C)). This method is recommended for portability.
