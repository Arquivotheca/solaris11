.TH crypt 3C "28 Sep 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
crypt \- string encoding function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <crypt.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBcrypt\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIkey\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIsalt\fR);
.fi

.SS "Standard conforming"
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBcrypt\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIkey\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIsalt\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcrypt()\fR function encodes strings suitable for secure storage as passwords. It generates the password hash given the \fIkey\fR and \fIsalt\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIkey\fR argument is the plain text password to be encrypted.
.sp
.LP
If the first character of \fIsalt\fR is "$", \fBcrypt()\fR uses \fBcrypt.conf\fR(4) to determine which shared module to load for the encryption algorithm.  The algorithm name \fBcrypt()\fR uses to search in \fBcrypt.conf\fR is the string between the first and second "$", or between the first "$" and first "," if a "," comes before the second "$".
.sp
.LP
If the first character of \fIsalt\fR is not "$", the algorithm described on \fBcrypt_unix\fR(5) is used.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcrypt()\fR returns a pointer to the encoded string. Otherwise it returns a null pointer and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The return value points to static data that is overwritten by each call.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBcrypt()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
An entry in \fBcrypt.conf\fR is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBELIBACC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The required shared library was not found.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
There is insufficient memory to generate the hash.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The functionality is not supported on this system.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The values returned by this function might not be portable among standard-conforming systems. See \fBstandards\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
Applications should not use \fBcrypt()\fR to store or verify user passwords but should use the functions described on \fBpam\fR(3PAM) instead.
