.TH wcscoll 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wcscoll, wscoll \- wide character string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBwcscoll\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBwscoll\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcscoll()\fR and  \fBwscoll()\fR functions compare the wide character string pointed to by \fIws1\fR to the wide character string pointed to by \fIws2\fR, both interpreted as appropriate to the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category of the current locale.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcscoll()\fR and \fBwscoll()\fR functions do not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if successful.
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0 before calling \fBwcscoll()\fR or \fBwscoll()\fR.  If \fBerrno\fR is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBwcscoll()\fR and \fBwscoll()\fR return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, depending upon whether the wide character string pointed to by \fIws1\fR is greater than, equal to, or less than the wide character string pointed to by \fIws2\fR, when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current locale. On error, \fBwcscoll()\fR and  \fBwscoll()\fR may set \fBerrno\fR, but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcscoll()\fR and \fBwscoll()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIws1\fR or \fIws2\fR arguments contain wide character codes outside the domain of the collating sequence.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsxfrm\fR(3C) and \fBwcscmp\fR(3C) functions should be used for sorting large lists.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
