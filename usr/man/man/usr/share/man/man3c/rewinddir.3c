.TH rewinddir 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
rewinddir \- reset position of directory stream to the beginning of a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBrewinddir\fR(\fBDIR *\fR\fIdirp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrewinddir()\fR function resets the position of the directory stream to which \fIdirp\fR refers to the beginning of the directory. It also causes the directory stream to refer to the current state of the corresponding directory, as a call to \fBopendir\fR(3C) would have done.  If \fIdirp\fR does not refer to a directory stream, the effect is undefined.
.sp
.LP
After a call to the \fBfork\fR(2) function, either the parent or child (but not both) may continue processing the directory stream using \fBreaddir\fR(3C), \fBrewinddir()\fR or \fBseekdir\fR(3C). If both the parent and child processes use these functions, the result is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBrewinddir()\fR function does not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBrewinddir()\fR function should be used in conjunction with \fBopendir()\fR, \fBreaddir()\fR, and \fBclosedir\fR(3C) to examine the contents of the directory. This method is recommended for portability.
