.TH pthread_setcanceltype 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_setcanceltype \- set cancellation type of a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_setcanceltype\fR(\fBint\fR \fItype\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIoldtype\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setcanceltype()\fR function atomically sets the calling thread's cancellation type to the specified \fBtype\fR and, if  \fIoldtype\fR is not  \fINULL,\fR stores the previous cancellation \fBtype\fR in  \fIoldtype\fR. The  \fBtype\fR can be either of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This is the default. When cancellation is enabled (enabled cancellation is also the default), cancellation occurs when the target thread reaches a cancellation point and a cancel is pending. When cancellation is disabled, all cancellation requests to the target thread are held pending.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When cancellation is enabled, receipt of a  \fBpthread_cancel\fR(3C) call causes immediate cancellation. When cancellation is disabled, all cancellation requests to the target thread are held pending; as soon as cancellation is re-enabled, pending cancellations are executed immediately.
.RE

.sp
.LP
See \fBcancellation\fR(5) for the definition of a cancellation point and a discussion of cancellation concepts. See \fBpthread_setcancelstate\fR(3C) for explanations of enabling and disabling cancellation.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setcanceltype()\fR function is a cancellation point if \fBtype\fR is called with \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS\fR and the cancellation state is \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE.\fR 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the  \fBpthread_setcanceltype()\fR function returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_setcanceltype()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The specified \fBtype\fR is not \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED\fR or \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.\fR
