.TH gettimeofday 3C "1 Aug 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
gettimeofday, settimeofday \- get or set the date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/time.h>

\fBint\fR \fBgettimeofday\fR(\fBstruct timeval *\fR\fItp\fR, \fBvoid *\fR\fItzp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBsettimeofday\fR(\fBstruct timeval *\fR\fItp\fR, \fBvoid *\fR\fItzp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgettimeofday()\fR function gets and the \fBsettimeofday()\fR function sets the system's notion of the current time. The current time is expressed in elapsed seconds and microseconds since 00:00 Universal Coordinated Time, January 1, 1970. The resolution of the system clock is hardware dependent; the time may be updated continuously or in clock ticks.
.sp
.LP
The \fItp\fR argument points to a \fBtimeval\fR structure, which includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
long    tv_sec;    /* seconds since Jan. 1, 1970 */
long    tv_usec;   /* and microseconds */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If \fItp\fR is a null pointer, the current time information is not returned or set.
.sp
.LP
The \fBTZ\fR environment variable holds time zone information. See \fBTIMEZONE\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
The \fItzp\fR argument to \fBgettimeofday()\fR and \fBsettimeofday()\fR is ignored.
.sp
.LP
Only privileged processes can set the time of day.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsettimeofday()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The structure pointed to by \fItp\fR specifies an invalid time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The {\fBPRIV_SYS_TIME\fR} privilege was not asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBgettimeofday()\fR function will fail for 32-bit interfaces if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The system time has progressed beyond 2038, thus the size of the \fBtv_sec\fR member of the \fBtimeval\fR structure pointed to by \fItp\fR is insufficient to hold the current time in seconds.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
If the \fBtv_usec\fR member of \fItp\fR is > 500000, \fBsettimeofday()\fR rounds the seconds upward. If the time needs to be set with better than one second accuracy, call \fBsettimeofday()\fR for the seconds and then \fBadjtime\fR(2) for finer accuracy.
