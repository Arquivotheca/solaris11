.TH clock_settime 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
clock_settime, clock_gettime, clock_getres \- high-resolution clock operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>

\fBint\fR \fBclock_settime\fR(\fBclockid_t\fR \fIclock_id\fR, \fBconst struct timespec *\fR\fItp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBclock_gettime\fR(\fBclockid_t\fR \fIclock_id\fR, \fBstruct timespec *\fR\fItp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBclock_getres\fR(\fBclockid_t\fR \fIclock_id\fR, \fBstruct timespec *\fR\fIres\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBclock_settime()\fR function sets the specified clock, \fIclock_id\fR, to the value specified by \fItp\fR. Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples of the resolution of the specified clock are truncated down to the smaller multiple of the resolution.
.sp
.LP
The \fBclock_gettime()\fR function returns the current value \fItp\fR for the specified clock, \fIclock_id\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The resolution of any clock can be obtained by calling \fBclock_getres()\fR. Clock resolutions are system-dependent and cannot be set by a process. If the argument \fIres\fR is not \fINULL\fR, the resolution of the specified clock is stored in the location pointed to by \fIres\fR. If \fIres\fR is \fINULL\fR, the clock resolution is not returned. If the time argument of \fBclock_settime()\fR is not a multiple of \fIres\fR, then the value is truncated to a multiple of \fIres\fR. 
.sp
.LP
A clock may be systemwide (that is, visible to all processes) or per-process (measuring time that is meaningful only within a process). 
.sp
.LP
A \fIclock_id\fR of \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR is defined in <\fBtime.h\fR>. This clock represents the realtime clock for the system. For this clock, the values returned by \fBclock_gettime()\fR and specified by \fBclock_settime()\fR represent the amount of time (in seconds and nanoseconds) since the Epoch. Additional clocks may also be supported. The interpretation of time values for these clocks is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
A \fIclock_id\fR of \fBCLOCK_HIGHRES\fR represents the non-adjustable, high-resolution clock for the system. For this clock, the value returned by \fBclock_gettime\fR(3C) represents the amount of time (in seconds and nanoseconds) since some arbitrary time in the past; it is not correlated in any way to the time of day, and thus is not subject to resetting or drifting by way of \fBadjtime\fR(2), \fBntp_adjtime\fR(2), \fBsettimeofday\fR(3C), or \fBclock_settime()\fR.  The time source for this clock is the same as that for \fBgethrtime\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
Additional clocks may also be supported. The interpretation of time values for these clocks is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR  is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
