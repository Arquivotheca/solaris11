.TH _stack_grow 3C "18 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
_stack_grow \- express an intention to extend the stack
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ucontext.h>

\fBvoid *\fR\fB_stack_grow\fR(\fBvoid *\fR\fIaddr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB_stack_grow()\fR function indicates to the system that the stack is  about to be extended to the address specified by \fIaddr\fR. If extending the stack to this address would violate the stack boundaries as retrieved by \fBstack_getbounds\fR(3C), a \fBSIGSEGV\fR is raised.
.sp
.LP
If the disposition of \fBSIGSEGV\fR is \fBSIG_DFL\fR, the process is terminated and a core dump is generated.  If the application has installed its own \fBSIGSEGV\fR handler to run on the alternate signal stack, the signal information passed to the handler will be such that a call to \fBstack_violation\fR(3C) with these parameters returns 1.
.sp
.LP
The \fIaddr\fR argument is a biased stack pointer value. See the Solaris 64-bit Developer's Guide.
.sp
.LP
This function has no effect if the specified address, \fIaddr\fR, is within the bounds of the current stack.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the \fB_stack_grow()\fR function  succeeds and does not detect a stack violation, it returns \fIaddr\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fB_stack_grow()\fR function does not actually adjust the stack pointer register. The caller is responsible for manipulating the stack pointer register once \fB_stack_grow()\fR returns.
.sp
.LP
The \fB_stack_grow()\fR function is typically invoked by code created by the compilation environment prior to executing code that modifies the stack pointer. It can also be used by hand-written assembly routines to allocate stack-based storage safely.
