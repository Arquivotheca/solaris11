.TH fgetpos 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fgetpos \- get current file position information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfgetpos\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR, \fBfpos_t *\fR\fIpos\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetpos()\fR function stores the current value of the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR in the object pointed to by \fIpos\fR. The value stored contains unspecified information usable by \fBfsetpos\fR(3C) for repositioning the stream to its position at the time of the call to \fBfgetpos()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfgetpos()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero value and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetpos()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESPIPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is associated with a pipe, a FIFO, or a socket.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The current value of the file position cannot be represented correctly in an object of type \fBfpos_t\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetpos()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).
