.TH mq_unlink 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mq_unlink \- remove a message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <mqueue.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmq_unlink\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmq_unlink()\fR function removes the message queue named by the pathname \fIname\fR. After a successful call to \fBmq_unlink()\fR with \fIname\fR, a call to \fBmq_open\fR(3C) with \fIname\fR fails if the flag \fBO_CREAT\fR is not set in \fIflags\fR. If one or more processes have the message queue open when \fBmq_unlink()\fR is called, destruction of the message queue is postponed until all references to the message queue have been closed. Calls to \fBmq_open\fR(3C) to re-create the message queue may fail until the message queue is actually removed. However, the \fBmq_unlink()\fR call need not block until all references have been closed; it may return immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmq_unlink()\fR returns \fB0\fR; otherwise, the named message queue is not changed by this function call, the function returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
