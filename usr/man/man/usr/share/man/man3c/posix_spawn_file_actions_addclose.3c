.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions add or delete a close or open action to a spawn file actions object.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is of type \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t\fR (defined in <\fBspawn.h\fR>) and is used to specify a series of actions to be performed by a \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) operation to arrive at the set of open file descriptors for the child process given the set of open file descriptors of the parent.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object, when passed to \fBposix_spawn()\fR or \fBposix_spawnp()\fR, specifies how the set of open file descriptors in the calling process is transformed into a set of potentially open file descriptors for the spawned process. This transformation occurs as though the specified sequence of actions was performed exactly once, in the context of the spawned process (prior to execution of the new process image), in the order in which the actions were added to the object.  Additionally, when the new process image is executed, any file descriptor (from this new set) which has its \fBFD_CLOEXEC\fR flag set is closed (see \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose()\fR function adds a close action to the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR that causes the file descriptor fildes to be closed (as if \fBclose\fR(\fIfildes\fR) had been called) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addopen()\fR function adds an open action to the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR that causes the file named by path to be opened (as if \fBopen\fR(\fIpath\fR, \fIoflag\fR, \fImode\fR) had been called, and the returned file descriptor, if not \fIfildes\fR, had been changed to \fIfildes\fR) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object. If \fIfildes\fR was already an open file descriptor, it is closed before the new file is opened.
.sp
.LP
The string described by \fIpath\fR is copied by the \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addopen()\fR function.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIfildes\fR is negative or greater than or equal to {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR}.
.RE

.sp
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIfile_actions\fR is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
It is not considered an error for the \fIfildes\fR argument passed to these functions to specify a file descriptor for which the specified operation could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such error will be detected when the associated file actions object is later used during a \fBposix_spawn()\fR or \fBposix_spawnp()\fR operation.
.sp
.LP
If a \fBclose\fR(2) operation is specified for a file descriptor that is not open at the time of the call to \fBposix_spawn()\fR or \fBposix_spawnp()\fR, the close operation will not cause the \fBposix_spawn()\fR or \fBposix_spawnp()\fR operation to fail.
