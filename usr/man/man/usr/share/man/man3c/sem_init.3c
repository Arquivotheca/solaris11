.TH sem_init 3C "9 Jul 2009" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_init \- initialize an unnamed semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_init\fR(\fBsem_t *\fR\fIsem\fR, \fBint\fR \fIpshared\fR, \fBunsigned int\fR \fIvalue\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_init()\fR function is used to initialize the unnamed semaphore referred to by \fIsem\fR. The value of the initialized semaphore is \fIvalue\fR. Following a successful call to \fBsem_init()\fR, the semaphore may be used in subsequent calls to \fBsem_wait\fR(3C), \fBsem_trywait\fR(3C), \fBsem_post\fR(3C), and \fBsem_destroy\fR(3C). This semaphore remains usable until the semaphore is destroyed.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIpshared\fR argument has a non-zero value, then the semaphore is shared between processes; in this case, any process that can access the semaphore \fIsem\fR can use \fIsem\fR for performing \fBsem_wait\fR(3C), \fBsem_trywait\fR(3C), \fBsem_post\fR(3C), and \fBsem_destroy\fR(3C) operations.
.sp
.LP
Only \fIsem\fR itself may be used for performing synchronization. The result of referring to copies of \fIsem\fR in calls to \fBsem_wait\fR(3C), \fBsem_trywait\fR(3C), \fBsem_post\fR(3C), and \fBsem_destroy\fR(3C), is undefined.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIpshared\fR argument is zero, then the semaphore is shared between threads of the process; any thread in this process can use \fIsem\fR for performing \fBsem_wait\fR(3C), \fBsem_trywait\fR(3C), \fBsem_post\fR(3C), and \fBsem_destroy\fR(3C) operations. The use of the semaphore by threads other than those created in the same process is undefined.
.sp
.LP
Attempting to initialize an already initialized semaphore results in undefined behavior.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_open\fR(3C) function is used with named semaphores.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the function initializes the semaphore in \fIsem\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fIvalue\fR argument exceeds  \fBSEM_VALUE_MAX\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
A resource required to initialize the semaphore has been exhausted, or the resources have reached the limit on semaphores (\fBSEM_NSEMS_MAX\fR). 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fBsem_init()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The process lacks the appropriate privileges to initialize the semaphore.
