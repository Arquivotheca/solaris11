.SH NAME
pthread_mutexattr_getpshared, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared \- get or set process-shared attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_mutexattr_getpshared\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpshared\fR);

     \fBint\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_mutexattr_getpshared()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. The \fBpthread_mutexattr_setpshared()\fR function is used to set the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is set to  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED\fR to permit a mutex to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the mutex is allocated, even if the mutex is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR, the mutex will only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized the mutex; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a mutex, the behavior is undefined. The default value of the attribute is \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE\fR. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_mutexattr_getpshared()\fR returns  \fB0\fR and stores the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpshared\fR parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_mutexattr_setpshared()\fR returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
