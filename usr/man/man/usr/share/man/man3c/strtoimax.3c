.TH strtoimax 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
strtoimax, strtoumax \- convert string to integer type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <inttypes.h>

\fBintmax_t\fR \fBstrtoimax\fR(\fBconst char *restrict\fR \fInptr\fR,
     \fBchar **restrict\fR \fIendptr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIbase\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBuintmax_t\fR \fBstrtoumax\fR(\fBconst char *restrict\fR \fInptr\fR,
     \fBchar **restrict\fR \fIendptr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIbase\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions are equivalent to the \fBstrtol()\fR, \fBstrtoll()\fR, \fBstrtoul()\fR, and \fBstrtoull()\fR functions, except that the initial portion of the string is converted to \fBintmax_t\fR and \fBuintmax_t\fR representation, respectively.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These functions return the converted value, if any.
.sp
.LP
If no conversion could be performed, 0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If the correct value is outside the range of representable values, {\fBINTMAX_MAX\fR}, {\fBINTMAX_MIN\fR}, or {\fBUINTMAX_MAX\fR} is returned (according to the return type and sign of the value, if any), and \fBerrno\fR is set to \fBERANGE\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBERANGE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value to be returned is not representable.
.RE

.sp
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fIbase\fR is not supported.
