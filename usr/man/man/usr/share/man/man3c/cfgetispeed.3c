\fBspeed_t\fR \fBcfgetospeed\fR(\fBconst struct termios *\fR\fItermios_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgetispeed()\fR function extracts the input baud rate from the \fBtermios\fR structure to which the \fItermios_p\fR argument points.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfgetospeed()\fR function extracts the output baud rate from the \fBtermios\fR structure to which the \fItermios_p\fR argument points.
.sp
.LP
These functions returns exactly the value in the \fBtermios\fR data structure, without interpretation.
.SH RETURN VALUES
