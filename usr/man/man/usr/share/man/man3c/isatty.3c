.TH isatty 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
isatty \- test for a terminal device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBisatty\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBisatty()\fR function tests whether \fIfildes\fR, an open file descriptor, is associated with a terminal device.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBisatty()\fR function returns \fB1\fR if \fIfildes\fR is associated with a terminal; otherwise it returns \fB0\fR and may set \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBisatty()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not associated with a terminal.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBisatty()\fR function does not necessarily indicate that a human being is available for interaction via \fIfildes\fR. It is quite possible that non-terminal devices are connected to the communications line.
