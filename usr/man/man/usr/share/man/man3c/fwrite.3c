.TH fwrite 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fwrite \- binary output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBfwrite\fR(\fBconst void *\fR\fIptr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIsize\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fInitems\fR, \fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwrite()\fR function writes, from the array pointed to by \fIptr\fR, up to \fInitems\fR elements whose size is specified by \fIsize\fR, to the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR. For each object, \fIsize\fR calls are made to the \fBfputc\fR(3C) function, taking the values (in order) from an array of \fBunsigned char\fR exactly overlaying the object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
The \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the file will be marked for update between the successful execution of \fBfwrite()\fR and the next successful completion of a call to \fBfflush\fR(3C) or \fBfclose\fR(3C) on the same stream or a call to \fBexit\fR(2) or \fBabort\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwrite()\fR function returns the number of elements successfully written, which might be less than \fInitems\fR if a write error is encountered. If \fIsize\fR or \fInitems\fR is 0, \fBfwrite()\fR returns 0 and the state of the stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfputc\fR(3C).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Because of possible differences in element length and byte ordering, files written using \fBfwrite()\fR are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be read using \fBfread\fR(3C) by a different application or by the same application on a different processor.
