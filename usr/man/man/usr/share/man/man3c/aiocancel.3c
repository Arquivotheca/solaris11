.SH NAME
aiocancel \- cancel an asynchronous operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/asynch.h>

\fBint\fR \fBaiocancel\fR(\fBaio_result_t *\fR\fIresultp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBaiocancel()\fR cancels the asynchronous operation associated with the result buffer pointed to by \fIresultp\fR. It may not be possible to immediately cancel an operation which is in progress and in this case, \fBaiocancel()\fR will not wait to cancel it.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBaiocancel()\fR returns  \fB0\fR and the requested operation is cancelled.  The application will not receive the \fBSIGIO\fR completion signal for an asynchronous operation that is successfully cancelled.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBaiocancel()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Upon failure, \fBaiocancel()\fR returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
\fBaiocancel()\fR will fail if any of the following are true:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The parameter \fIresultp\fR does not correspond to any outstanding asynchronous operation, although there is at least one currently outstanding.

.LP
Passing an illegal address as \fIresultp\fR will result in setting \fBerrno\fR to \fBEFAULT\fR \fIonly\fR if it is detected by the application process.
