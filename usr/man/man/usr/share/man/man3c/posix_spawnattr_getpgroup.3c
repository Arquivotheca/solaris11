.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getpgroup, posix_spawnattr_setpgroup \- get and set spawn-pgroup attribute of spawn attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_getpgroup\fR(\fBconst posix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBpid_t *restrict\fR \fIpgroup\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_setpgroup\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBpid_t\fR \fIpgroup\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_getpgroup()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIspawn-pgroup\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_setpgroup()\fR function sets the \fIspawn-pgroup\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIspawn-pgroup\fR attribute represents the process group to be joined by the new process image in a spawn operation (if \fBPOSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP\fR is set in the \fIspawn-flags\fR attribute). The default value of this attribute is zero.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_getpgroup()\fR returns 0 and stores the value of the \fIspawn-pgroup\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpgroup\fR parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_setpgroup()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
