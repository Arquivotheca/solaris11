.TH wmemset 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wmemset \- set wide-characters in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwchar_t *\fR\fBwmemset\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fR\fIws\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemset()\fR function copies the value of \fIwc\fR into each of the first \fIn\fR wide-characters of the object pointed to by \fIws\fR. This function is not affected by locale and all \fBwchar_t\fR values are treated identically.  The null wide-character and \fBwchar_t\fR values not corresponding to valid  characters are not treated specially.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is 0,  \fIws\fR must be a valid pointer and the function copies zero wide-characters.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemset()\fR functions returns the value of \fIws\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
