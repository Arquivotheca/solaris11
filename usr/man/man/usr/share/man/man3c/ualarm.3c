.TH ualarm 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
ualarm \- schedule signal after interval in microseconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBuseconds_t\fR \fBualarm\fR(\fBuseconds_t\fR \fIuseconds\fR, \fBuseconds_t\fR \fIinterval\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBualarm()\fR function causes the \fBSIGALRM\fR signal to be generated for the calling process after the number of real-time microseconds specified by the \fIuseconds\fR argument has elapsed.  When the \fIinterval\fR argument is non-zero, repeated timeout notification occurs with a period in microseconds specified by the \fIinterval\fR argument. If the notification signal, \fBSIGALRM\fR, is not caught or ignored, the calling process is terminated.
.sp
.LP
Because of scheduling delays, resumption of execution when the signal is caught may be delayed an arbitrary amount of time.
.sp
.LP
Interactions between \fBualarm()\fR and either \fBalarm\fR(2) or \fBsleep\fR(3C) are unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBualarm()\fR function returns the number of microseconds remaining from the previous \fBualarm()\fR call.  If no timeouts are pending or if \fBualarm()\fR has not previously been called, \fBualarm()\fR returns \fB0\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBualarm()\fR function is a simplified interface to \fBsetitimer\fR(2), and uses the \fBITIMER_REAL\fR interval timer.
