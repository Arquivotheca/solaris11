.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 \- add dup2 action to spawn file actions object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR, \fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fInewfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function adds a \fBdup2\fR(3C) action to the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR that causes the file descriptor \fIfildes\fR to be duplicated as \fInewfildes\fR (as if \fBdup2\fR(\fIfildes\fR, \fInewfildes\fR) had been called) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is be returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIfildes\fR or \fInewfildes\fR is negative or greater than or equal to {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR}.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIfile_actions\fR is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.LP
It is not considered an error for the \fIfildes\fR argument passed to \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR to specify a file descriptor for which the specified operation could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such error will be detected when the associated file actions object is later used during a \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C) operation.
