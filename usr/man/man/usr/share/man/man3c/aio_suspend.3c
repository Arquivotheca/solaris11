.TH aio_suspend 3C "2 Aug 2011" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
aio_suspend \- wait for asynchronous I/O request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <aio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBaio_suspend\fR(\fBconst struct aiocb * const\fR \fIlist\fR[], \fBint\fR \fInent\fR,
     \fBconst struct timespec *\fR\fItimeout\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBaio_suspend()\fR function suspends the calling thread until at least one of the asynchronous I/O operations referenced by the \fIlist\fR argument has completed, until a signal interrupts the function, or, if \fItimeout\fR is not \fINULL\fR, until the time interval specified by \fItimeout\fR has passed. If any of the \fBaiocb\fR structures in the list correspond to completed asynchronous I/O operations (that is, the error status for the operation is not equal to \fBEINPROGRESS\fR) at the time of the call, the function returns without suspending the calling thread.  If there are no outstanding asynchronous I/O operations, \fBaio_suspend()\fR returns immediately with \fBEAGAIN\fR. The \fIlist\fR argument is an array of pointers to asynchronous I/O control blocks. The \fInent\fR argument indicates the number of elements in the array and is limited to \fB_AIO_LISTIO_MAX\fR = 4096. Each \fBaiocb\fR structure pointed to will have been used in initiating an asynchronous I/O request via \fBaio_read\fR(3C), \fBaio_write\fR(3C), or \fBlio_listio\fR(3C). This array may contain null pointers, which are ignored. If this array contains pointers that refer to \fBaiocb\fR structures that have not been used in submitting asynchronous I/O, the effect is undefined. If there are no outstanding asynchronous I/O operations, \fBaio_suspend()\fR returns immediately with \fBEAGAIN\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the time interval indicated in the \fBtimespec\fR structure pointed to by \fItimeout\fR passes before any of the I/O operations referenced by \fIlist\fR are completed, then \fBaio_suspend()\fR returns with an error.  If this array contains pointers that refer to \fBaiocb\fR structures that have not been used in submitting asynchronous I/O, the effect is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If \fBaio_suspend()\fR returns after one or more asynchronous I/O operations have completed, it returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR, and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The application may determine which asynchronous I/O completed by scanning the associated error and return status using \fBaio_error\fR(3C) and \fBaio_return\fR(3C), respectively.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBaio_suspend()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEAGAIN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
No asynchronous I/O indicated in the list referenced by \fIlist\fR completed in the time interval indicated by \fItimeout\fR.
.sp
There are no asynchronous I/O operations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A signal interrupted the \fBaio_suspend()\fR function. Since each asynchronous I/O operation might provoke a signal when it completes, this error return can be caused by the completion of one or more of the very I/O operations being awaited.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fInent\fR argument is less than or equal to 0 or greater than \fB_AIO_LISTIO_MAX\fR, or the \fBtimespec\fR structure pointed to by \fItimeout\fR is not properly set because \fItv_sec\fR is less than 0 or \fItv_nsec\fR is either less than 0 or greater than 10^9.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
There is currently not enough available memory; the application can try again later.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBaio_suspend()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.SH USAGE

.LP
The \fBaio_suspend()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
