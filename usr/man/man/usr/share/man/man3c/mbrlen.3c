.TH mbrlen 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mbrlen \- get number of bytes in a character (restartable)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBmbrlen\fR(\fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR, \fBmbstate_t *restrict\fR \fIps\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer,  \fBmbrlen()\fR determines the number of bytes constituting the character pointed to by  \fIs\fR. It is equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
mbstate_t internal;
mbrtowc(NULL, s, n, ps != NULL ? ps : &internal);
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, the \fBmbrlen()\fR function uses its own internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object, which is initialized at program startup to the initial conversion state.   Otherwise, the  \fBmbstate_t\fR object pointed to by \fIps\fR is used to completely describe the current conversion state of the associated character sequence. Solaris will behave as if no function defined in the Solaris Reference Manual calls \fBmbrlen()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbrlen()\fR function returns the first of the following that applies:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If the next \fIn\fR or fewer bytes complete the character that corresponds to the null wide-character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBpositive\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If the next \fIn\fR or fewer bytes complete a valid character; the value returned is the number of bytes that complete the character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB(size_t)\(mi2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If the next \fIn\fR bytes contribute to an incomplete but potentially valid  character, and all \fIn\fR bytes have been processed. When \fIn\fR has at least the value of the \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR macro, this case can only occur if  \fIs\fR points at a sequence of redundant shift sequences (for implementations with state-dependent encodings).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB(size_t)\(mi1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
If an encoding error occurs, in which case the next \fIn\fR or fewer bytes do not contribute to a complete and valid  character.  In this case, \fBEILSEQ\fR is stored in \fBerrno\fR and the conversion state is undefined.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbrlen()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIps\fR argument points to an object that contains an invalid conversion state.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Invalid character sequence is detected.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If \fIps\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbrlen()\fR uses the \fBmbstate_t\fR object pointed to by \fIps\fR and the function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale. If \fIps\fR is a null pointer, \fBmbrlen()\fR uses its internal \fBmbstate_t\fR object and the function is Unsafe in multithreaded applications.
