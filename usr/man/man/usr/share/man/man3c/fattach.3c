.SH NAME
fattach \- attach a STREAMS- or doors-based file descriptor to an object in the file system name space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stropts.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfattach\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfattach()\fR function attaches a STREAMS- or doors-based file descriptor to an object in the file system name space, effectively associating a name with \fIfildes\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument must be a valid open file descriptor representing a STREAMS or doors file. The \fIpath\fR argument is a path name of an existing object and the user must have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the file and have write permissions. All subsequent operations on \fIpath\fR will operate on the STREAMS or doors file until the STREAMS or doors file is detached from the node. The \fIfildes\fR argument can be attached to more than one \fIpath\fR, that is, a stream or door can have several names associated with it.
.sp
.LP
The attributes of the named stream or door (see \fBstat\fR(2)), are initialized as follows: the permissions, user ID, group ID, and times are set to those of \fIpath\fR, the number of links is set to 1, and the size and device identifier are set to those of the streams or doors device associated with \fIfildes\fR. If any attributes of the named stream or door are subsequently changed  (for example, \fBchmod\fR(2)), the attributes of the underlying object are not affected.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfattach()\fR returns \fB0\fR.  Otherwise it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets  \fBerrno\fR to indicate an error.
