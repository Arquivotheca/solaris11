.SH NAME
wcwidth \- number of column positions of a wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcwidth\fR(\fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcwidth()\fR function determines the number of column positions required for the wide character \fIwc\fR. The value of \fIwc\fR must be a character representable as a \fBwchar_t\fR, and must be a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in the current locale.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcwidth()\fR function either returns \fB0\fR (if \fIwc\fR is a null wide-character code), or returns the number of column positions to be occupied by the wide-character code \fIwc\fR, or returns \fB\(mi1\fR (if \fIwc\fR does not correspond to a printing wide-character code).
.SH ERRORS
