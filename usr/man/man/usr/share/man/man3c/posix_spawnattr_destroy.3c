.TH posix_spawnattr_destroy 3C "30 Jan 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_destroy, posix_spawnattr_init \- destroy and initialize spawn attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_destroy\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawnattr_init\fR(\fBposix_spawnattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_destroy()\fR function destroys a spawn attributes object. A destroyed \fIattr\fR attributes object can be reinitialized using \fBposix_spawnattr_init()\fR. The results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation can cause \fBposix_spawnattr_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by \fIattr\fR to an invalid value.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawnattr_init()\fR function initializes a spawn attributes object \fIattr\fR with the default value for all of the individual attributes used by the implementation. Results are undefined if \fBposix_spawnattr_init()\fR is called specifying an already initialized \fIattr\fR attributes object.
.sp
.LP
A spawn attributes object is of type \fBposix_spawnattr_t\fR (defined in <\fBspawn.h\fR>) and is used to specify the inheritance of process attributes across a spawn operation.
.sp
.LP
No attributes other than those defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-200x are provided.
.sp
.LP
The resulting spawn attributes object (possibly modified by setting individual attribute values), is used to modify the behavior of \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C). After a spawn attributes object has been used to spawn a process by a call to \fBposix_spawn()\fR or \fBposix_spawnp()\fR, any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction) will not affect any process that has been spawned in this way.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawnattr_destroy()\fR and \fBposix_spawnattr_init()\fR return 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
