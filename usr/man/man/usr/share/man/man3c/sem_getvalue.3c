.TH sem_getvalue 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_getvalue \- get the value of a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_getvalue\fR(\fBsem_t *restrict\fR \fIsem\fR, \fBint *restrict\fR \fIsval\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_getvalue()\fR function updates the location referenced by the \fIsval\fR argument to have the value of the semaphore referenced by \fIsem\fR without affecting the state of the semaphore. The updated value represents an actual semaphore value that occurred at some unspecified time during the call, but it need not be the actual value of the semaphore when it is returned to the calling process.
.sp
.LP
If \fIsem\fR is locked, then the value returned by \fBsem_getvalue()\fR is either zero or a negative number whose absolute value represents the number of processes waiting for the semaphore at some unspecified time during the call.
.sp
.LP
The value set in \fIsval\fR may be 0 or positive. If \fIsval\fR is 0, there may be other processes (or LWPs or threads) waiting for the semaphore; if \fIsval\fR is positive, no process is waiting.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBsem_getvalue()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsem_getvalue()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fIsem\fR argument does not refer to a valid semaphore.
