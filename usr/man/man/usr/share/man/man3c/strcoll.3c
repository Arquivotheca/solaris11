.TH strcoll 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
strcoll \- string collation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>

\fBint\fR \fBstrcoll\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIs1\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIs2\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Both \fBstrcoll()\fR and \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) provide for locale-specific string sorting.  \fBstrcoll()\fR is intended for applications in which the number of comparisons per string is small. When strings are to be compared a number of times, \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) is a more appropriate function because the transformation process occurs only once.
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrcoll()\fR function does not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if successful.
.sp
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, then call \fBstrcoll()\fR, then check \fBerrno\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBstrcoll()\fR returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero in direct correlation to whether string \fIs1\fR is greater than, equal to, or less than the string \fIs2\fR.  The comparison is based on strings interpreted as appropriate to the program's locale  for category \fBLC_COLLATE\fR (see \fBsetlocale\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
On error, \fBstrcoll()\fR may set \fBerrno\fR, but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrcoll()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIs1\fR or \fIs2\fR arguments contain characters outside the domain of the collating sequence.

The \fBstrcoll()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
