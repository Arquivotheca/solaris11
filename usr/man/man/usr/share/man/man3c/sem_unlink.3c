.TH sem_unlink 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_unlink \- remove a named semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_unlink\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_unlink()\fR function removes the semaphore named by the string \fIname\fR. If the semaphore named by \fIname\fR is currently referenced by other processes, then \fBsem_unlink()\fR has no effect on the state of the semaphore.  If one or more processes have the semaphore open when \fBsem_unlink()\fR is called, destruction of the semaphore is postponed until all references to the semaphore have been destroyed by calls to \fBsem_close\fR(3C), \fB_Exit\fR(2), or one of the \fBexec\fR functions (see \fBexec\fR(2)) . Calls to \fBsem_open\fR(3C) to re-create or re-connect to the semaphore refer to a new semaphore after  \fBsem_unlink()\fR is called.  The \fBsem_unlink()\fR call does not block until all references have been destroyed; it returns immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBsem_unlink()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, the semaphore is not changed and the function returns a value of \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsem_unlink()\fR function will fail if:
.sp

.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The length of \fIname\fR string exceeds \fIPATH_MAX\fR, or a pathname component is longer than \fINAME_MAX\fR while \fB_POSIX_NO_TRUNC\fR is in effect.

.SH NOTES

.LP
Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
