.SH NAME
abort \- terminate the process abnormally
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBabort\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBabort()\fR function causes abnormal process termination to occur, unless the signal \fBSIGABRT\fR is being caught and the signal handler does not return.  The abnormal termination processing includes at least the effect of \fBfclose\fR(3C) on all open streams and message catalogue descriptors, and the default actions defined for \fBSIGABRT\fR. The \fBSIGABRT\fR signal is sent to the calling process as if by means of the \fBraise\fR(3C) function with the argument \fBSIGABRT\fR.
.sp
.LP
The status made available to \fBwait\fR(3C) or \fBwaitpid\fR(3C) by  \fBabort\fR will be that of a process terminated by the \fBSIGABRT\fR signal.   \fBabort\fR will override blocking or ignoring the \fBSIGABRT\fR signal.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBabort()\fR function does not return.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Catching the signal is intended to provide the application writer with a portable means to abort processing, free from possible interference from any  implementation-provided library functions.  If \fBSIGABRT\fR is neither caught nor ignored, and the current directory is writable, a core dump may be produced.
