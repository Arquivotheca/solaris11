.TH getwd 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
getwd \- get current working directory pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBgetwd\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIpath_name\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetwd()\fR function determines an absolute pathname of the current working directory of the calling process, and copies that pathname into the array pointed to by the \fIpath_name\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
If the length of the pathname of the current working directory is greater than (\fIPATH_MAX\fR + 1) including the null byte, \fBgetwd()\fR fails and returns a null pointer.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a pointer to the string containing the absolute pathname of the current working directory is returned.  Otherwise, \fBgetwd()\fR returns a null pointer and the contents of the array pointed to by \fIpath_name\fR are undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
For portability to implementations conforming to versions of the X/Open Portability Guide prior to SUS, \fBgetcwd\fR(3C) is preferred over this function.
