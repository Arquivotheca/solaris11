.TH sem_close 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sem_close \- close a named semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsem_close\fR(\fBsem_t *\fR\fIsem\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_close()\fR function is used to indicate that the calling process is finished using the named semaphore indicated by \fIsem\fR. The effects of calling \fBsem_close()\fR for an unnamed semaphore (one created by \fBsem_init\fR(3C)) are undefined. The \fBsem_close()\fR function deallocates (that is, make available for reuse by a subsequent \fBsem_open\fR(3C) by this process) any system resources allocated by the system for use by this process for this semaphore. The effect of subsequent use of the semaphore indicated by \fIsem\fR by this process is undefined. If the semaphore has not been removed with a successful call to \fBsem_unlink\fR(3C), then \fBsem_close()\fR has no effect on the state of the semaphore. If the \fBsem_unlink\fR(3C) function has been successfully invoked for \fIname\fR after the most recent call to \fBsem_open\fR(3C) with \fBO_CREAT\fR for this semaphore, then when all processes that have opened the semaphore close it, the semaphore is no longer be accessible.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBsem_close()\fR returns \fB0\fR, otherwise it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_close()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fIsem\fR argument is not a valid semaphore descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fBsem_close()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBsem_close()\fR function should not be called for an unnamed semaphore initialized by \fBsem_init\fR(3C). 
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
