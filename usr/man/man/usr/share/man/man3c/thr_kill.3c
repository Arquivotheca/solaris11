.TH thr_kill 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
thr_kill \- send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <signal.h> 
#include <thread.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBthr_kill\fR(\fBthread_t\fR \fIthread\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsig\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBthr_kill()\fR function sends the \fIsig\fR signal to the thread designated by \fIthread\fR. The \fIthread\fR argument must be a member of the same process as the calling thread. The \fIsig\fR argument must be one of the signals listed in \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD), with the exception of \fBSIGCANCEL\fR being reserved and off limits to \fBthr_kill()\fR. If \fIsig\fR is \fB0\fR, a validity check is done for the existence of the target thread; no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBthr_kill()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise,  an error number is returned. In the event of failure, no signal is sent.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBthr_kill()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIsig\fR argument value is not zero and is an invalid or an  unsupported signal number.
