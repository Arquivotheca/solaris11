.SH NAME
pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling, pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling \- get or set prioceiling attribute of mutex attribute object
.SH SYNOPSIS

cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIprioceiling\fR);

     \fBint\fR \fIprioceiling\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling()\fR and \fBpthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling()\fR functions, respectively, get and set the priority ceiling attribute of a mutex attribute object pointed to by \fIattr\fR, which was previously created by the \fBpthread_mutexattr_init()\fR function.
.sp
.LP
The \fIprioceiling\fR attribute contains the priority ceiling of initialized mutexes. The values of \fIprioceiling\fR must be within the range of priorities defined by \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIprioceiling\fR attribute defines the priority ceiling of initialized mutexes, which is the minimum priority level at which the critical section guarded by the mutex is executed. In order to avoid priority inversion, the priority ceiling of the mutex must be set to a priority higher than or equal to the highest priority of all the threads that may lock that mutex.
.sp
.LP
The ceiling value should be drawn from the range of priorities for the \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR policy. When a thread acquires such a mutex, the policy of the thread at mutex acquisition should match that from which the ceiling value was derived (\fBSCHED_FIFO\fR, in this case).    If a thread changes its scheduling policy while holding a ceiling mutex, the  behavior of \fBpthread_mutex_lock()\fR and \fBpthread_mutex_unlock()\fR on this mutex is undefined. See \fBpthread_mutex_lock\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling()\fR and \fBpthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
