.TH fgetwc 3C "15 Oct 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fgetwc \- get a wide-character code from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBwint_t\fR \fBfgetwc\fR(\fBFILE*\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR function obtains the next character (if present) from the input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR, converts that to the corresponding wide-character code and advances the associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined).
.sp
.LP
If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is indeterminate.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR function may mark the \fBst_atime\fR field of the file associated with \fIstream\fR for update. The \fBst_atime\fR field will be marked for update by the first successful execution of \fBfgetwc()\fR, \fBfgetc\fR(3C), \fBfgets\fR(3C), \fBfgetws\fR(3C), \fBfread\fR(3C), \fBfscanf\fR(3C), \fBgetc\fR(3C), \fBgetchar\fR(3C), \fBgets\fR(3C), or \fBscanf\fR(3C) using \fIstream\fR that returns data not supplied by a prior call to \fBungetc\fR(3C) or \fBungetwc\fR(3C). 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion the \fBfgetwc()\fR function returns the wide-character code of the character read from the input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR converted to a type \fBwint_t\fR. 
.sp
.LP
For standard-conforming (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) applications, if the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, \fBfgetwc()\fR returns \fBWEOF\fR whether or not the stream is at end-of-file.
.sp
.LP
If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set, \fBfgetwc()\fR returns \fBWEOF\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
If an encoding error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set, \fBfgetwc()\fR returns \fBWEOF\fR, and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR function will fail if data needs to be read and:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEAGAIN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR flag is set for the file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR and the process would be delayed in the \fBfgetwc()\fR operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is in a background process group attempting to read from its controlling terminal and either the process is ignoring or blocking the \fBSIGTTIN\fR signal or the process group is orphaned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding  \fIstream\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient storage space is available.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENXIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The data obtained from the input stream does not form a valid character.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBferror\fR(3C) or \fBfeof\fR(3C) functions must be used to distinguish between an error condition and an end-of-file condition.
