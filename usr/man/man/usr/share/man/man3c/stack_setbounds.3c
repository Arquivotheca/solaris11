.SH NAME
stack_setbounds \- update stack boundaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ucontext.h>

\fBint\fR \fBstack_setbounds\fR(\fBconst stack_t *\fR\fIsp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_setbounds()\fR function updates the current base and bounds of the stack for the current thread to the bounds specified by the \fBstack_t\fR structure pointed to by \fIsp\fR. The \fBss_sp\fR member refers to the virtual address of the base of the stack memory. The \fBss_size\fR member refers to the size of the stack in bytes. The \fBss_flags\fR member must be set to 0.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBstack_setbounds()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_setbounds()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIsp\fR argument does not refer to a valid address or the \fBss_sp\fR member of the \fBstack_t\fR structure pointed to by \fIsp\fR points to an illegal address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBss_sp\fR member of the \fBstack_t\fR structure pointed to by sp is not properly aligned, the \fBss_size\fR member is too small or is not properly aligned, or the \fBss_flags\fR member is non-zero.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_setbounds()\fR function is intended for use by applications that are managing their own alternate stacks.
