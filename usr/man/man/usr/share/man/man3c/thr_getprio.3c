.SH NAME
thr_getprio, thr_setprio \- access dynamic thread scheduling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR...[ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <thread.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBthr_setprio\fR(\fBthread_t\fR \fItarget_thread\fR, \fBint\fR \fIpriority\fR);

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBthr_getprio\fR(\fBthread_t\fR \fItarget_thread\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIpriority\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBthr_setprio()\fR function sets the scheduling priority for the thread specified by target_thread within the current process to the value given by priority.
.sp
.LP
The \fBthr_getprio()\fR function stores the current priority for the thread specified by \fItarget_thread\fR in the location pointed to by \fIpriority\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBthr_setprio()\fR function fails, the scheduling priority of the target thread is not changed.
.sp
.LP
See \fBpriocntl\fR(2), \fBpthread_setschedprio\fR(3C), and \fBsched_setparam\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBthr_getprio()\fR and \fBthr_setprio()\fR functions return \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
