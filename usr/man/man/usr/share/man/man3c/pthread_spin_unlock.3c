.TH pthread_spin_unlock 3C "30 Jan 2004" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_spin_unlock \- unlock a spin lock object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_spin_unlock\fR(\fBpthread_spinlock_t *\fR\fIlock\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_spin_unlock()\fR function releases the spin lock referenced by \fIlock\fR which was locked with the \fBpthread_spin_lock\fR(3C) or \fBpthread_spin_trylock\fR(3C) functions. The results are undefined if the lock is not held by the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the lock when \fBpthread_spin_unlock()\fR is called, the lock becomes available and an unspecified spinning thread acquires the lock.
.sp
.LP
The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized thread spin lock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
