.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBttyname()\fR function returns a pointer to a string containing the null-terminated path name of the terminal device associated with file descriptor \fIfildes\fR. The return value points to thread-specific data whose content is overwritten by each call from the same thread.
.sp
.LP
The \fBttyname_r()\fR function has the same functionality as \fBttyname()\fR except that the caller must supply a buffer \fIname\fR with length \fInamelen\fR to store the result; this buffer must be at least \fB_POSIX_PATH_MAX\fR in size (defined in <\fBlimits.h\fR>). The standard-conforming version (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) of \fBttyname_r()\fR takes a \fInamesize\fR parameter of type \fBsize_t\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBttyname()\fR and \fBttyname_r()\fR return a pointer to a string. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The standard-conforming \fBttyname_r()\fR returns 0 if successful or the error number upon failure.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBttyname()\fR and \fBttyname_r()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor. This condition is reported.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument does not refer to a terminal device. This condition is reported.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBttyname_r()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBERANGE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fInamesize\fR is smaller than the length of the string to be returned including the terminating null character.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When compiling multithreaded applications, see \fBIntro\fR(3), \fINotes On Multithreaded Applications\fR.
.sp
.LP
Messages printed from this function are in the native language specified by the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR locale category. See \fBsetlocale\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The return value of \fBttyname()\fR points to thread-specific data whose content is overwritten by each call from the same thread. This function is safe to use in multithreaded applications, but its use is discouraged. The \fBttyname_r()\fR function should used instead.
.sp
.LP
Solaris 2.4 and earlier releases provided definitions of the \fBttyname_r()\fR interface as specified in POSIX.1c Draft 6. The final POSIX.1c standard changed the interface as described above. Support for the Draft 6 interface is provided for compatibility only and might not be supported in future releases. New applications and libraries should use the standard-conforming interface.
