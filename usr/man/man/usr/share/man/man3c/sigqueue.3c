.TH sigqueue 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
sigqueue \- queue a signal to a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBsigqueue\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsigno\fR, \fBconst union sigval\fR \fIvalue\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigqueue()\fR function causes the signal specified by \fIsigno\fR to be sent with the value specified by \fIvalue\fR to the process specified by \fIpid\fR. If \fIsigno\fR is 0 (the null signal), error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent. The null signal can be used to check the validity of \fIpid\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The conditions required for a process to have permission to queue a signal to another process are the same as for the \fBkill\fR(2) function.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigqueue()\fR function returns immediately. If \fBSA_SIGINFO\fR is set for \fIsigno\fR and if the resources were available to queue the signal, the signal is queued and sent to the receiving process. If \fBSA_SIGINFO\fR is not set for \fIsigno\fR, then \fIsigno\fR is sent at least once to the receiving process; it is unspecified whether \fIvalue\fR will be sent to the receiving process as a result of this call.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIpid\fR causes \fIsigno\fR to be generated for the sending process, and if \fIsigno\fR is not blocked for the calling thread and if no other thread has \fIsigno\fR unblocked or is waiting in a \fBsigwait\fR(2) function for \fIsigno\fR, either \fIsigno\fR or at least the pending, unblocked signal will be delivered to the calling thread before the \fBsigqueue()\fR function returns. Should any of multiple pending signals in the range \fBSIGRTMIN\fR to \fBSIGRTMAX\fR be selected for delivery, it will be the lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the specified signal will have been queued, and the \fBsigqueue()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, the function returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsigqueue()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEAGAIN\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
No resources are available to queue the signal. The process has already queued \fBSIGQUEUE_MAX\fR signals that are still pending at the receiver(s), or a system wide resource limit has been exceeded.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The value of \fIsigno\fR is an invalid or unsupported signal number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fBsigqueue()\fR function is not supported by the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The process does not have the appropriate privilege to send the signal to the receiving process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The process \fIpid\fR does not exist.
