.TH fsetpos 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fsetpos \- reposition a file pointer in a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfsetpos\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR, \fBconst fpos_t *\fR\fIpos\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsetpos()\fR function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR according to the value of the object pointed to by \fIpos\fR, which must be a value obtained from an earlier call to \fBfgetpos\fR(3C) on the same stream.
.sp
.LP
A successful call to \fBfsetpos()\fR function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of \fBungetc\fR(3C) on the same stream.  After an \fBfsetpos()\fR call, the next operation on an update stream may be either input or output.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsetpos()\fR function returns \fB0\fR if it succeeds; otherwise it returns a non-zero value and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsetpos()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESPIPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is associated with a pipe, a FIFO, or a socket.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBfsetpos()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).
