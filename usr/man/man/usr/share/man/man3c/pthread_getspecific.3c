.TH pthread_getspecific 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_getspecific, pthread_setspecific \- manage thread-specific data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_setspecific\fR(\fBpthread_key_t\fR \fIkey\fR, \fBconst void *\fR\fIvalue\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBvoid *\fR\fBpthread_getspecific\fR(\fBpthread_key_t\fR \fIkey\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR function associates a thread-specific \fIvalue\fR with a \fIkey\fR obtained by way of a previous call to \fBpthread_key_create()\fR. Different threads may bind different values to the same key. These values are typically pointers to blocks of dynamically allocated memory that have been reserved for use by the calling thread.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_getspecific()\fR function returns the value currently bound to the specified \fIkey\fR on behalf of the calling thread.
.sp
.LP
The effect of calling \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR or \fBpthread_getspecific()\fR with a \fIkey\fR value not obtained from \fBpthread_key_create()\fR or after \fIkey\fR has been deleted with \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR is undefined.
.sp
.LP
Both \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR and \fBpthread_getspecific()\fR may be called from a thread-specific data destructor function. However, calling \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR from a destructor may result in lost storage or infinite loops.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_getspecific()\fR function returns the thread-specific data value associated with the given \fIkey\fR. If no thread-specific data value is associated with \fIkey\fR, then the value \fINULL\fR is returned.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Insufficient memory exists to associate the value with the key.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setspecific()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The key value is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_getspecific()\fR function does not  return errors.
