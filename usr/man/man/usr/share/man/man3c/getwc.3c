.TH getwc 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
getwc \- get wide character from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBgetwc\fR(\fBFILE\fR \fI*stream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetwc()\fR function is equivalent to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C), except that if it is implemented as a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fR more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with side effects.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C). 
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C). 
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
This interface is provided to align with some current implementations and with possible future \fBISO\fR standards.
.sp
.LP
Because it may be implemented as a macro, \fBgetwc()\fR may treat incorrectly a \fIstream\fR argument with side effects.  In particular, \fBgetwc\fR(*\fIf\fR\|++) may not work as expected.  Therefore, use of this function is not recommended; \fBfgetwc\fR(3C) should be used instead.
