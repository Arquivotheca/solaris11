.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_getclock, pthread_condattr_setclock \- get and set the clock selection condition variable attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_getclock\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_condattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBclockid_t *restrict\fR \fIclock_id\fR);

.LP
.nf

      \fBclockid_t\fR \fIclock_id\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_condattr_getclock()\fR function obtains the value of the clock attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. The \fBpthread_condattr_setclock()\fR function sets the clock attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. If \fBpthread_condattr_setclock()\fR is called with a \fIclock_id\fR argument that refers to a CPU-time clock, the call fails.
.sp
.LP
The clock attribute is the clock ID of the clock that is used to measure the timeout service of \fBpthread_cond_timedwait\fR(3C). The default value of the clock attribute refers to the system clock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_condattr_getclock()\fR function returns 0 and stores the value of the clock attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIclock_id\fR argument. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_condattr_setclock()\fR function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
