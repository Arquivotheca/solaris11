.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getschedpolicy, pthread_attr_setschedpolicy \- get or set schedpolicy attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpolicy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIpolicy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR, respectively, set and get the \fIschedpolicy\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
Supported values of \fIpolicy\fR include  \fBSCHED_FIFO,\fR \fBSCHED_RR\fR and  \fBSCHED_OTHER,\fR which are defined by the header \fB<sched.h>\fR. When threads executing with the scheduling policy \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR or  \fBSCHED_RR\fR are waiting on a mutex, they acquire the mutex in priority order when the mutex is unlocked.
.sp
.LP
See \fBsched.h\fR(3HEAD) for a description of all defined policy values.  Valid policy values can also be obtained from \fBpthread_getschedparam\fR(3C) and \fBsched_getscheduler\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR or \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
\fIattr\fR or \fIpolicy\fR is invalid.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the specified attributes using \fBpthread_create()\fR. Using these routines does not affect the current running thread.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
