.TH catgets 3C "22 Mar 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
catgets \- read a program message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <nl_types.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBcatgets\fR(\fBnl_catd\fR \fIcatd\fR, \fBint\fR \fIset_num\fR, \fBint\fR \fImsg_num\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIs\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatgets()\fR function attempts to read message \fImsg_num\fR, in set \fIset_num\fR, from the message catalog identified by  \fIcatd\fR. The \fIcatd\fR argument is a catalog descriptor returned from an earlier call to  \fBcatopen()\fR. The \fIs\fR argument points to a default message string which will be returned by  \fBcatgets()\fR if the identified message catalog is not currently available.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the identified message is retrieved successfully,  \fBcatgets()\fR returns a pointer to an internal buffer area containing the  null terminated message string. If the call is unsuccessful for any reason, \fBcatgets()\fR returns a pointer to \fIs\fR and \fBerrno\fR may be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatgets()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The \fIcatd\fR argument is not a valid message catalogue descriptor open for reading.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADMSG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The number of \fB%n\fR specifiers that appear in the message string specified by \fIs\fR does not match the number of \fB%n\fR specifiers that appear in the message identified by \fIset_id\fR and \fImsg_id\fR in the specified message catalog.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The message catalog identified by \fIcatd\fR is corrupted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMSG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The message identified by \fIset_id\fR and \fImsg_id\fR is not in the message catalog.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatgets()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
