.TH pthread_kill 3C "23 Mar 2005" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_kill \- send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <signal.h> 
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_kill\fR(\fBpthread_t\fR \fIthread\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsig\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_kill()\fR function sends the \fIsig\fR signal to the thread designated by thread.  The \fIthread\fR argument must be a member of the same process as the calling thread. The \fIsig\fR argument must be  one of the signals listed in \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD), with the exception of \fBSIGCANCEL\fR being reserved and off limits to \fBpthread_kill()\fR.  If \fIsig\fR is 0, a validity check is performed for the existence of the target thread; no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the function returns a value of  \fB0\fR. Otherwise the function returns an error number. If the \fBpthread_kill()\fR function fails, no signal is sent.
.SH ERRORS
