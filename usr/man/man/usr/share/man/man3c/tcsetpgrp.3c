.TH tcsetpgrp 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcsetpgrp \- set foreground process group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcsetpgrp\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBpid_t\fR \fIpgid_id\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If the process has a controlling terminal, \fBtcsetpgrp()\fR will set the foreground process group \fBID\fR associated with the terminal to \fIpgid_id\fR. The file associated with \fIfildes\fR must be the controlling terminal of the calling process and the controlling terminal must be currently associated with the session of the calling process. The value of \fIpgid_id\fR must match a process group \fBID\fR of a process in the same session as the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcsetpgrp()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2

This implementation does not support the value in the \fIpgid_id\fR argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal, or the controlling terminal is no longer associated with the session of the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fIpgid_id\fR does not match the process group \fBID\fR of a process in the same session as the calling process.
