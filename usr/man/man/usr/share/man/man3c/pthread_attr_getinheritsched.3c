.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getinheritsched, pthread_attr_setinheritsched \- get or set inheritsched attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getinheritsched\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIinheritsched\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setinheritsched\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIinheritsched\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setinheritsched()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_getinheritsched()\fR, respectively, set and get the \fIinheritsched\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
When the attribute objects are used by \fBpthread_create()\fR, the \fIinheritsched\fR attribute determines how the other scheduling attributes of the created thread are to be set:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
Specifies that the scheduling policy and associated attributes are to be inherited from the creating thread, and the scheduling attributes in this \fIattr\fR argument are to be ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
Specifies that the scheduling policy and associated attributes are to be set to the corresponding values from this attribute object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The symbols  \fBPTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED\fR and  \fBPTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED\fR are defined in the header \fB<pthread.h>\fR\&. 
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setinheritsched()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_getinheritsched()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setinheritsched()\fR or \fBpthread_attr_getinheritsched()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
\fIattr\fR or \fIinheritsched\fR is invalid.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the specified attributes using \fBpthread_create()\fR. Using these routines does not affect the current running thread.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
