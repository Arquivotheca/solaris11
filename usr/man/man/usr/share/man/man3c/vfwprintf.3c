.TH vfwprintf 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
vfwprintf, vswprintf, vwprintf \- wide-character formatted output of a stdarg argument list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBvfwprintf\fR(\fBFILE *restrict\fR \fIstream\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR,
     \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBvswprintf\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR,
     \fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR, \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBvwprintf\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR, \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvwprintf()\fR, \fBvfwprintf()\fR, and \fBvswprintf()\fR functions are the same as \fBwprintf()\fR, \fBfwprintf()\fR, and \fBswprintf()\fR respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined by  <\fBstdarg.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
These functions do not invoke the  \fBva_end()\fR macro.  However, as these functions do invoke the \fBva_arg()\fR macro, the value of \fIap\fR after the return is indeterminate.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Refer to  \fBfwprintf\fR(3C).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to  \fBfwprintf\fR(3C).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Applications using these functions should call \fBva_end(\fR\fIap\fR\fB)\fR afterwards to clean up.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBvwprintf()\fR, \fBvfwprintf()\fR, and \fBvswprintf()\fR functions can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
