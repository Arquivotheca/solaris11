.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These macros classify character-coded integer values. Each is a predicate returning non-zero for true, \fB0\fR for false. The behavior of these macros, except \fBisascii()\fR, is affected by the current locale (see \fBsetlocale\fR(3C)). To modify the behavior, change the \fBLC_TYPE\fR category in  \fBsetlocale()\fR, that is, \fBsetlocale(\fR\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fInewlocale\fR). In the "C" locale, or in a locale where character type information is not defined, characters are classified according to the rules of the \fBUS-ASCII\fR 7-bit coded character set.
.sp
.LP
The \fBisascii()\fR macro is defined on all integer values. The rest are defined only where the argument is an \fBint\fR, the value of which is representable as an \fBunsigned char\fR, or \fBEOF\fR, which is defined by the <\fBstdio.h\fR> header and represents end-of-file.
.sp
.LP
Functions exist for all the macros defined below. To get the function form, the macro name must be undefined (for example, \fB#undef isdigit\fR).
.sp
.LP
For macros described with \fBDefault\fR and \fBStandard conforming\fR versions, standard-conforming behavior is provided for standard-conforming applications (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) and for applications that define \fB__XPG4_CHAR_CLASS__\fR before including <\fBctype.h\fR>.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the argument to any of the character handling macros is not in the domain of the function, the result is undefined. Otherwise, the macro or function returns non-zero if the classification is \fBTRUE\fR and \fB0\fR if the classification is \fBFALSE\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
These macros or functions can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
