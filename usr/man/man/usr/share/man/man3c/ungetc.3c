.SH NAME
ungetc \- push byte back into input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBungetc\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR, \fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBungetc()\fR function pushes the byte specified by \fIc\fR (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR) back onto the input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR. The pushed-back bytes will be returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR) to a file-positioning function ( \fBfseek\fR(3C), \fBfsetpos\fR(3C) or \fBrewind\fR(3C)) discards any pushed-back bytes for the stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
Four bytes of push-back are guaranteed.  If \fBungetc()\fR is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIc\fR equals that of the macro \fBEOF\fR, the operation fails and the input stream is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
A successful call to \fBungetc()\fR clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all pushed-back bytes will be the same as it was before the bytes were pushed back. The file-position indicator is decremented by each successful call to \fBungetc()\fR; if its value was 0 before a call, its value is indeterminate after the call.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBungetc()\fR returns the byte pushed back after conversion.  Otherwise it returns \fBEOF.\fR
