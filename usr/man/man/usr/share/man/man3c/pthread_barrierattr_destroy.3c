.SH NAME
pthread_barrierattr_destroy, pthread_barrierattr_init \- destroy and initialize barrier attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR(\fBpthread_barrierattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_barrierattr_init\fR(\fBpthread_barrierattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_barrierattr_destroy()\fR function destroys a barrier attributes object. A destroyed \fIattr\fR attributes object can be reinitialized using \fBpthread_barrierattr_init()\fR. The results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation can cause \fBpthread_barrierattr_destroy()\fR to set the object referenced by \fIattr\fR to an invalid value.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_barrierattr_init()\fR function initializes a barrier attributes object \fIattr\fR with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the implementation.
.sp
.LP
Results are undefined if \fBpthread_barrierattr_init()\fR is called specifying an already initialized \fIattr\fR attributes object.
.sp
.LP
After a barrier attributes object has been used to initialize one or more barriers, any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction) does not affect any previously initialized barrier.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_barrierattr_destroy()\fR and \fBpthread_barrierattr_init()\fR functions returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

The \fBpthread_barrierattr_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
