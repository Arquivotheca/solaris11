.TH nanosleep 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
nanosleep \- high resolution sleep
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>

\fBint\fR \fBnanosleep\fR(\fBconst struct timespec *\fR\fIrqtp\fR,
     \fBstruct timespec *\fR\fIrmtp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnanosleep()\fR function causes the current thread  to be suspended from execution until either the time interval specified by the \fIrqtp\fR argument has elapsed or a signal is delivered to the calling thread and its action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to terminate the process. The suspension time may be longer than requested because the argument value is rounded up to an integer multiple of the sleep resolution or because of the scheduling of other activity by the system. But, except for the case of being interrupted by a signal, the suspension time will not be less than the time specified by \fIrqtp\fR, as measured by the system clock, \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The use of the \fBnanosleep()\fR function has no effect on the action or blockage of any signal.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the \fBnanosleep()\fR function returns because the requested time has elapsed, its return value is \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the \fBnanosleep()\fR function returns because it has been interrupted by a signal, the function returns a value of \(mi1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the interruption. If the \fIrmtp\fR argument is non-\fINULL\fR, the \fBtimespec\fR structure referenced by it is updated to contain the amount of time remaining in the interval (the requested time minus the time actually slept). If the \fIrmtp\fR argument is \fINULL\fR, the remaining time is not returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fBnanosleep()\fR fails, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
