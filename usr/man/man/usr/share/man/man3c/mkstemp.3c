.TH mkstemp 3C "22 Feb 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mkstemp, mkstemps, mkdtemp \- make a unique file name from a template and open the file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmkstemp\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fItemplate\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBmkstemps\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fItemplate\fR, \fBint\fR \fIslen\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBchar *\fR\fBmkdtemp\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fItemplate\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR function replaces the contents of the string pointed to by \fItemplate\fR by a unique file name, and returns a file descriptor for the file open for reading and writing. The function thus prevents any possible race condition between testing whether the file exists and opening it for use. The string in \fItemplate\fR should look like a file name with six trailing 'X's; \fBmkstemp()\fR replaces each 'X' with a character from the portable file name character set. The characters are chosen such that the resulting name does not duplicate the name of an existing file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemps()\fR function behaves the same as \fBmkstemp()\fR, except it permits a suffix to exist in the template. The template should be of the form /\fBtmp\fR/\fBtmp\fR\fIXXXXXX\fR\fIsuffix\fR. The \fIslen\fR parameter specifies the length of the suffix string.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkdtemp()\fR function makes the same replacement to the template as in \fBmktemp\fR(3C) and creates the template directory using \fBmkdir\fR(2), passing a \fImode\fR argument of 0700.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmkstemp()\fR returns an open file descriptor. Otherwise \(mi1 is returned if no suitable file could be created.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR, \fBmkstemps()\fR, and \fBmkdtemp()\fR functions can set \fBerrno\fR to the same values as \fBlstat\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR and \fBmkstemps()\fR functions can set \fBerrno\fR to the same values as \fBopen\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkdtemp()\fR function can set \fBerrno\fR to the same values as \fBmkdir\fR(2).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
It is possible to run out of letters.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR function does not check to determine whether the file name part of \fItemplate\fR exceeds the maximum allowable file name length.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile\fR(3C) function is preferred over this function.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR function is frequently used to create a temporary file that will be removed by the application before the application terminates.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkstemp()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets. See \fBlf64\fR(5).
