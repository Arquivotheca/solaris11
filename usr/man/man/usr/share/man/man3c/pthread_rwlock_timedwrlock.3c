.SH NAME
pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock, pthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np \- lock a read-write lock for writing

#include <time.h>

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()\fR function applies a write lock to the read-write lock referenced by \fIrwlock\fR as in the \fBpthread_rwlock_wrlock\fR(3C) function. If the lock cannot be acquired without waiting for other threads to unlock the lock, this wait will be terminated when the specified timeout expires. The timeout expires when the absolute time specified by \fIabs_timeout\fR passes, as measured by the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds \fIabs_timeout\fR), or if the absolute time specified by \fIabs_timeout\fR has already been passed at the time of the call.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np()\fR function is identical to the \fBpthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()\fR function, except that the timeout is specified as a relative time interval. The timeout expires when the time interval specified by \fIrel_timeout\fR passes, as measured by the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock, or if the time interval specified by \fIrel_timeout\fR is negative at the time of the call.
.sp
.LP
The resolution of the timeout is the resolution of the \fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR clock. The \fBtimespec\fR data type is defined in the <\fBtime.h\fR> header. Under no circumstances does either function fail with a timeout if the lock can be acquired immediately. The validity of the a\fIbs_timeout\fR parameter need not be checked if the lock can be immediately acquired.
.sp
.LP
If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is delivered to a thread blocked on a read- write lock with a call to \fBpthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()\fR or \fBpthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np()\fR, upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting for the lock as if it was not interrupted.
.sp
.LP
The calling thread can deadlock if at the time the call is made it holds the read-write lock. The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized read-write lock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()\fR and \fBpthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np()\fR functions return 0 if the lock for writing on the read-write lock object referenced by \fIrwlock\fR is acquired. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp

The \fBpthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()\fR and \fBpthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEDEADLK\fR\fR

.RS 11n
.rt  
The value specified by \fIrwlock\fR does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object, or the timeout nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than or equal to 1,000 million.
