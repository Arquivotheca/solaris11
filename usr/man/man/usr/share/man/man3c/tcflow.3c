.TH tcflow 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcflow \- suspend or restart the transmission or reception of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcflow\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIaction\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function suspends transmission or reception of data on the object referred to by \fIfildes\fR, depending on the value of \fIaction\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIaction\fR is \fBTCOOFF\fR, output is suspended.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIaction\fR is \fBTCOON\fR, suspended output is restarted.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIaction\fR is \fBTCIOFF\fR, the system transmits a \fBSTOP\fR character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data to the system.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIaction\fR is \fBTCION\fR, the system transmits a \fBSTART\fR character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to start transmitting data to the system.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its input nor its output are suspended.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcflow()\fR from a process which is a member of a background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a \fBSIGTTOU\fR signal. If the calling process is blocking or ignoring \fBSIGTTOU\fR signals, the process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n

.rt  
The \fIaction\fR argument is not a supported value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.LP
The \fBtcflow()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or blocking \fBSIGTTOU\fR.
