.TH wmemmove 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
wmemmove \- copy wide-characters in memory with overlapping areas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwchar_t *\fR\fBwmemmove\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemmove()\fR function copies \fIn\fR wide-characters from the object pointed to by \fIws2\fR to the object pointed to by \fIws1\fR. Copying takes place as if the \fIn\fR wide-characters from the object pointed to by \fIws2\fR are first copied into a temporary array of \fIn\fR wide-characters that does not overlap the objects pointed to by \fIws1\fR or \fIws2\fR, and then the \fIn\fR wide-characters from the temporary array are copied into the object pointed to by \fIws1.\fR
.sp
.LP
This function is not affected by locale and all \fBwchar_t\fR values are treated identically.  The null wide-character and \fBwchar_t\fR values not corresponding to valid  characters are not treated specially.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is 0,  \fIws1\fR and \fIws2\fR must be a valid pointers, and the function copies zero wide-characters.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemmove()\fR function returns the value of \fIws1\fR.
.SH ERRORS

.LP
No errors are defined.
