.TH fflush 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fflush \- flush a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfflush\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIstream\fR points to an output stream or an update stream in which the most recent operation was not input, \fBfflush()\fR causes any unwritten data for that stream to be written to the file, and the \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the underlying file are marked for update.
.sp
.LP
If \fIstream\fR points to an input stream or an update stream into which the most recent operation was input, that stream is flushed if it is seekable and is not already at end-of-file.  Flushing an input stream discards any buffered input and adjusts the file pointer such that the next input operation accesses the byte after the last one read.  A stream is seekable if the underlying file is not a pipe, FIFO, socket, or TTY device.
.sp
.LP
If \fIstream\fR is a null pointer, \fBfflush()\fR performs this flushing action on all streams for which the behavior is defined above.
.sp
.LP
An input stream, seekable or non-seekable, can be flushed by explicitly calling \fBfflush()\fR with a non-null argument specifying that stream.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfflush()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, it returns \fBEOF\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBfflush()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEAGAIN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR flag is set for the file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR and the process would be delayed in the write operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is not valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFBIG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size or the process's file size limit; or the file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding stream.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fBfflush()\fR function was interrupted by a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The process is a member of a background process group attempting to write to its controlling terminal, \fBTOSTOP\fR is set, the process is neither ignoring nor blocking \fBSIGTTOU\fR, and the process group of the process is orphaned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPIPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
An attempt is made to write to a pipe or \fBFIFO\fR that is not open for reading by any process. A \fBSIGPIPE\fR signal will also be sent to the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBfflush()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENXIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was beyond the limits of the device.
