.TH getdate 3C "21 Dec 2010" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
getdate \- convert user format date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>

\fBstruct tm *\fR\fBgetdate\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIstring\fR);
extern int getdate_err;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetdate()\fR function converts user-definable date and/or time specifications pointed to by \fIstring\fR to a \fBtm\fR structure. The \fBtm\fR structure is defined in the <\fBtime.h\fR> header.
.sp
.LP
User-supplied templates are used to parse and interpret the input string.  The templates are  text files created by the user and identified via the environment variable \fBDATEMSK\fR. Each line in the template represents an acceptable date and/or time specification using  conversion specifications similar to those used by \fBstrftime\fR(3C) and \fBstrptime\fR(3C). Dates before 1902 and after 2037 are illegal. The first line in the template that matches the input specification is used for interpretation and conversion into  the internal time format.

.SS "General Specifications"
.sp
.LP
A conversion specification that is an ordinary character is executed by scanning the next character from the buffer. If the character scanned from the buffer differs from the one comprising the conversion specification, the specification fails, and the differing and subsequent characters remain unscanned.
.sp
.LP
A series of conversion specifications composed of \fB%n\fR, \fB%t\fR, white space characters, or any combination is executed by scanning up to the first character that is not white space (which remains unscanned), or until no more characters can be scanned.
.sp
.LP
Any other conversion specification is executed by scanning characters until a character matching the next conversion specification is scanned, or until no more characters can be scanned.  These characters, except the one matching the next conversion specification, are then compared to the locale values associated with the conversion specifier.  If a match is found, values for the appropriate \fItm\fR structure members are set to values corresponding to the locale information. If no match is found, \fBgetdate()\fR fails and no more characters are scanned.
.sp
.LP
The month names, weekday names, era names, and alternative numeric symbols can consist of any combination of upper and lower case letters.  The user can request that the input date or time specification be in a specific language by setting the \fBLC_TIME\fR category using \fBsetlocale\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBgetdate()\fR returns a pointer to a \fBtm\fR structure; otherwise, it returns \fINULL\fR and sets the global variable \fBgetdate_err\fR to indicate the error. Subsequent calls to \fBgetdate()\fR alter the contents of \fBgetdate_err\fR.
