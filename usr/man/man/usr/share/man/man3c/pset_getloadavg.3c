.SH NAME
pset_getloadavg \- get system load averages for a processor set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/pset.h>
#include <sys/loadavg.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpset_getloadavg\fR(\fBpsetid_t\fR \fIpset\fR, \fBdouble\fR \fIloadavg\fR[\|], \fBint\fR \fInelem\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_getloadavg()\fR function returns the number of processes assigned to the specified processor set that are in the system run queue, averaged over various periods of time.  Up to \fInelem\fR samples are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of \fIloadavg\fR[\|].  The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
.sp
.LP
The \fBLOADAVG_1MIN\fR, \fBLOADAVG_5MIN\fR, and \fBLOADAVG_15MIN\fR indices, defined  in <\fBsys/loadavg.h\fR>, can be used to extract the data from the appropriate element of the \fIloadavg\fR[\|] array.
.sp
.LP
If pset is \fBPS_NONE\fR, the load average for processes not assigned to a processor set is returned.
.sp
.LP
If pset is \fBPS_MYID\fR, the load average for the processor set to which the caller is bound is returned.  If the caller is not bound to a processor set, the result is the same as if \fBPS_NONE\fR was specified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the number of samples  actually retrieved is returned. If the load average was unobtainable or the processor set does not exist, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpset_getloadavg()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The number of elements specified is less than 0, or an invalid processor set ID was specified.
.sp
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the specified processor set is not that of the zone's pool.
