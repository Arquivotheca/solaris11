.TH posix_fallocate 3C "26 Jul 2011" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
posix_fallocate \- file space control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fcntl.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_fallocate\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBoff_t\fR \fIoffset\fR, \fBoff_t\fR \fIlen\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fallocate()\fR function ensures that any required storage for regular file data starting at \fIoffset\fR and continuing for \fIlen\fR bytes is allocated on the file system storage media. If \fBposix_fallocate()\fR returns successfully, subsequent writes to the specified file data will not fail due to the lack of free space on the file system storage media.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIoffset\fR+\fIlen\fR is beyond the current file size, then \fBposix_fallocate()\fR adjusts the file size to \fIoffset\fR+\fIlen\fR. Otherwise, the file size is not changed.
.sp
.LP
Space allocated with \fBposix_fallocate()\fR is freed by a successful call to \fBcreat\fR(2) or \fBopen\fR(2) that truncates the size of the file. Space allocated with \fBposix_fallocate()\fR may be freed by a successful call to \fBftruncate\fR(3C) that reduces the file size to a size smaller than \fIoffset\fR+\fIlen\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_fallocate()\fR returns zero. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fallocate()\fR function will fail if:

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fallocate()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets. See \fBlf64\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fallocate()\fR function is supported only for regular files residing on UFS filesystems. Attempts to use it with files on any other filesystem type results in an \fBEINVAL\fR error.
