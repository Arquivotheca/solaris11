.TH tcflush 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcflush \- flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data or both
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcflush\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIqueue_selector\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtcflush()\fR discards data written to the object referred to by \fIfildes\fR (an open file descriptor associated with a terminal) but not transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the value of \fIqueue_selector\fR:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCIFLUSH\fR it flushes data received but not read.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCOFLUSH\fR it flushes data written but not transmitted.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCIOFLUSH\fR it flushes both data received but not read and data written but not transmitted.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcflush()\fR from a process which is a member of a background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a \fBSIGTTOU\fR signal. If the calling process is blocking or ignoring \fBSIGTTOU\fR signals, the process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
