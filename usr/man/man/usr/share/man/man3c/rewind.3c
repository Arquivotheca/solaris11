.SH NAME
rewind \- reset file position indicator in a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBrewind\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The call:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
rewind(stream)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
is equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
(void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
except that \fBrewind()\fR also clears the error indicator.
.SH RETURN VALUES

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfseek\fR(3C) with the exception of \fBEINVAL\fR which does not apply.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Because \fBrewind()\fR does not return a value, an application wishing to detect errors should clear \fBerrno\fR, then call \fBrewind()\fR, and if \fBerrno\fR is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
