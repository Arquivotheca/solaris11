.TH shm_unlink 3C "5 Feb 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
shm_unlink \- remove a shared memory object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/mman.h>

\fBint\fR \fBshm_unlink\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBshm_unlink()\fR function removes the name of the shared memory object named by the string pointed to by \fIname\fR. If one or more references to the shared memory object exists when the object is unlinked, the name is removed before \fBshm_unlink()\fR returns, but the removal of the memory object contents will be postponed until all open and mapped references to the shared memory object have been removed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBshm_unlink()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise it returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error condition, and the named shared memory object is not affected by this function call.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBshm_unlink()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Permission is denied to unlink the named shared memory object.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The length of the \fIname\fR string exceeds  \fBPATH_MAX\fR, or a pathname component is longer than  \fINAME_MAX\fR while  \fB_POSIX_NO_TRUNC\fR is in effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOENT\fR \fR

.SH NOTES

Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
