.TH strxfrm 3C "10 Dec 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
strxfrm \- string transformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBstrxfrm\fR(\fBchar *restrict\fR \fIs1\fR, \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIs2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrxfrm()\fR function transforms the string pointed to by \fIs2\fR and places the resulting string into the array pointed to by \fIs1\fR. The transformation is such that if \fBstrcmp\fR(3C) is applied to two transformed strings, it returns a value greater than, equal to or less than \fB0\fR, corresponding to the result of \fBstrcoll\fR(3C) applied to the same two original strings. No more than \fIn\fR bytes are placed into the resulting array pointed to by \fIs1\fR, including the terminating null byte.  If \fIn\fR is \fB0\fR, \fIs1\fR is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrxfrm()\fR function does not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if successful.
.sp
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, then call \fBstrxfrm()\fR, then check \fBerrno\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBstrxfrm()\fR returns the length of the transformed string (not including the terminating null byte). If the value returned is \fIn\fR or more, the contents of the array pointed to by \fIs1\fR are indeterminate.
.sp
.LP
On error, \fBstrxfrm()\fR may set \fBerrno\fR but no return value is reserved to indicate the error.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The transformation function is such that two transformed strings can be ordered by \fBstrcmp\fR(3C) as appropriate to collating sequence information in the program's locale (category \fBLC_COLLATE\fR).
.sp
.LP
The fact that when \fIn\fR is \fB0\fR, \fIs1\fR is permitted to be a null pointer, is useful to determine the size of the \fIs1\fR array prior to making the transformation.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRA sample of using the \fBstrxfm()\fR function.
.sp
.LP
The value of the following expression is the size of the array needed to hold the transformation of the string pointed to by \fIs\fR.

The \fBstrxfrm()\fR function can be used safely in a multithreaded application, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
