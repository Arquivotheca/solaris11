.TH posix_fadvise 3C "14 Jul 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
posix_fadvise \- file advisory information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fcntl.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_fadvise\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBoff_t\fR \fIoffset\fR, \fBoff_t\fR \fIlen\fR, \fBint\fR \fIadvice\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fadvise()\fR function advises the system on the expected behavior of the application with respect to the data in the file associated with the open file descriptor, \fIfd\fR, starting at \fIoffset\fR and continuing for \fIlen\fR bytes. The specified range need not currently exist in the file. If \fIlen\fR is zero, all data following offset is specified. The system may use this information to optimize handling of the specified data. The \fBposix_fadvise()\fR function has no effect on the semantics of other operations on the specified data, although it may affect the performance of other operations.
.sp
.LP
The advice to be applied to the data is specified by the \fIadvice\fR parameter and may be one of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_NORMAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its behavior with respect to the specified data. It is the default characteristic if no advice is given for an open file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application expects to access the specified data sequentially from lower offsets to higher offsets.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_RANDOM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application expects to access the specified data in a random order.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_WILLNEED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application expects to access the specified data in the near future.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_DONTNEED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application expects that it will not access the specified data in the near future.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPOSIX_FADV_NOREUSE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
Specifies that the application expects to access the specified data once and then not reuse it thereafter.
.RE

.sp
.LP
These values are defined in \fB<fcntl.h>\fR
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_fadvise()\fR returns zero. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_fadvise()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfd\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The value of \fIadvice\fR is invalid, or the value of \fIlen\fR is less than zero.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBESPIPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfd\fR argument is associated with a pipe or FIFO.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
