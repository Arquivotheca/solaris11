.TH mbsinit 3C "24 Jul 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mbsinit \- determine conversion object status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmbsinit\fR(\fBconst mbstate_t *\fR\fIps\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fBps\fR is not a null pointer, the \fBmbsinit()\fR function determines whether the object pointed to by \fBps\fR describes an initial conversion state.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbsinit()\fR function returns non-zero if  \fBps\fR is a null pointer, or if the pointed-to object describes an initial conversion state; otherwise, it returns \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
If an \fBmbstate_t\fR object is altered by any of the functions described as "restartable", and is then used with a different character sequence, or in the other conversion direction, or with a different \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category setting than on earlier function calls, the behavior is undefined.  See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbstate_t\fR object is used to describe the current conversion state from a particular character sequence to a wide-character sequence (or vice versa) under the rules of a particular setting of the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale.
.sp
.LP
The initial conversion state corresponds, for a conversion in either direction, to the beginning of a new character sequence in the initial shift state.  A zero-valued \fBmbstate_t\fR object is at least one way to describe an initial conversion state.  A zero-valued \fBmbstate_t\fR object can be used to initiate conversion involving any character sequence, in any \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category setting.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbsinit()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
