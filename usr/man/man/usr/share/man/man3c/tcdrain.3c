.TH tcdrain 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcdrain \- wait for transmission of output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcdrain\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcdrain()\fR function waits until all output written to the object referred to by \fIfildes\fR is transmitted.  The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.sp
.LP
Any attempts to use \fBtcdrain()\fR from a process which is a member of a background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a \fBSIGTTOU\fR signal.  If the calling process is blocking or ignoring \fBSIGTTOU\fR signals, the process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcdrain()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A signal interrupted \fBtcdrain()\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.LP
The \fBtcdrain()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or blocking \fBSIGTTOU\fR.
