.SH NAME
killpg \- send signal to a process group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <signal.h>

\fBint\fR \fBkillpg\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpgrp\fR, \fBint\fR \fIsig\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkillpg()\fR function sends the signal \fIsig\fR to the process group \fIpgrp\fR. See \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD) for a list of signals.
.sp
.LP
The real or effective user \fBID\fR of the sending process must match the real or saved set-user \fBID\fR of the receiving process, unless the effective user \fBID\fR of the sending process is the privileged user. A single exception is the signal \fBSIGCONT\fR, which may always be sent to any descendant of the current process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBkillpg()\fR function will fail and no signal will be sent if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIsig\fR argument is not a valid signal number.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The effective user \fBID\fR of the sending process is not privileged user, and neither its real nor effective user \fBID\fR matches the real or saved set-user \fBID\fR of one or more of the target processes.
