.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_getpshared, pthread_condattr_setpshared \- get or set process-shared condition variable attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_getpshared\fR(
     \fBconst pthread_condattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_condattr_setpshared\fR(\fBpthread_condattr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fIpshared\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_condattr_getpshared()\fR function obtains the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute from the attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. The \fBpthread_condattr_setpshared()\fR function is used to set the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is set to  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED\fR to permit a condition variable to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the condition variable is allocated, even if the condition variable is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute is  \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,\fR the condition variable will only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized the condition variable; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a condition variable, the behavior is undefined.  The default value of the attribute is \fBPTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.\fR 
.sp
.LP
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the associated functions to get and set those attribute values are implementation-dependent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_condattr_setpshared()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_condattr_getpshared()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR and stores the value of the \fIprocess-shared\fR attribute of \fIattr\fR into the object referenced by the \fIpshared\fR parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
