.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBprintf()\fR function places output on the standard output stream \fBstdout\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBfprintf()\fR function places output on on the named output stream \fIstream\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsprintf()\fR function places output, followed by the null byte (\fB\e0\fR), in consecutive bytes starting at \fIs\fR; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that enough storage is available.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsnprintf()\fR function is identical to \fBsprintf()\fR with the addition of the argument \fIn\fR, which specifies the size of the buffer referred to by \fIs\fR. If \fIn\fR is 0, nothing is written and \fIs\fR can be a null pointer. Otherwise, output bytes beyond the \fIn\fR-1st are discarded instead of being written to the array and a null byte is written at the end of the bytes actually written into the array.
.sp
.LP
The \fBasprintf()\fR function is the same as the \fBsprintf()\fR function except that it returns, in the \fIret\fR argument, a pointer to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the output string. This pointer should be passed to \fBfree\fR(3C) to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed. If sufficient space cannot be allocated, the \fBasprintf()\fR function returns -1 and sets \fIret\fR to be a \fINULL\fR pointer.
.sp
.LP
Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints its arguments under control of the \fIformat\fR. The \fIformat\fR is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The \fIformat\fR is composed of zero or more directives: \fBordinary characters\fR, which are simply copied to the output stream and \fBconversion specifications\fR, each of which results in the fetching of zero or more arguments. The results are undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the \fIformat\fR. If the \fIformat\fR is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.
.sp
.LP
Conversions can be applied to the \fIn\fRth argument after the \fIformat\fR in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In this case, the conversion specifier \fB%\fR (see below) is replaced by the sequence \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR, where \fIn\fR is a decimal integer in the range [1, \fBNL_ARGMAX\fR], giving the position of the argument in the argument list. This feature provides for the definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages (see the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section).
.sp
.LP
In format strings containing the \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR form of conversion specifications, numbered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the format string as many times as required.
.sp
.LP
In format strings containing the \fB%\fR form of conversion specifications, each argument in the argument list is used exactly once.
.sp
.LP
All forms of the \fBprintf()\fR functions allow for the insertion of a language-dependent radix character in the output string. The radix character is defined by the program's locale (category \fBLC_NUMERIC\fR). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character defaults to a period (\fB\&.\fR).
.SS "Conversion Specifications"
.sp
.LP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the \fB%\fR character or by the character sequence \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR, after which the following appear in sequence:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional field, consisting of a decimal digit string followed by a \fB$\fR, specifying the next argument to be converted. If this field is not provided, the \fIargs\fR following the last argument converted will be used.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Zero or more \fIflags\fR (in any order), which modify the meaning of the conversion specification.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional minimum \fIfield width\fR. If the converted value has fewer bytes than the field width, it will be padded with spaces by default on the left; it will be padded on the right, if the left-adjustment flag (\fB\(hy\fR), described below, is given to the field width. The field width takes the form of an asterisk (*), described below, or a decimal integer.
.sp
If the conversion specifier is \fBs\fR, a standard-conforming application (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) interprets the field width as the minimum number of bytes to be printed; an application that is not standard-conforming interprets the field width as the minimum number of columns of screen display. For an application that is not standard-conforming, \fB%10s\fR means if the converted value has a screen width of 7 columns, 3 spaces would be padded on the right.
.sp
If the format is \fB%ws\fR, then the field width should be interpreted as the minimum number of columns of screen display.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional \fIprecision\fR that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the \fBd\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBo\fR, \fBu\fR, \fBx\fR, and \fBX\fR conversions (the field is padded with leading zeros); the number of digits to appear after the radix character for the \fBa\fR, \fBA\fR, \fBe\fR, \fBE\fR, \fBf\fR, and \fBF\fR conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for the \fBg\fR and \fBG\fR conversions; or the maximum number of bytes to be printed from a string in \fBs\fR and \fBS\fR conversions. The precision takes the form of a period (.) followed either by an asterisk (*), described below, or an optional decimal digit string, where a null digit string is treated as 0. If a precision appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
If the conversion specifier is \fBs\fR or \fBS\fR, a standard-conforming application (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) interprets the precision as the maximum number of bytes to be written; an application that is not standard-conforming interprets the precision as the maximum number of columns of screen display. For an application that is not standard-conforming, \fB%.5s\fR would print only the portion of the string that would display in 5 screen columns. Only complete characters are written.
.sp
For \fB%ws\fR, the precision should be interpreted as the maximum number of columns of screen display. The precision takes the form of a period (\fB\&.\fR) followed by a decimal digit string; a null digit string is treated as zero. Padding specified by the precision overrides the padding specified by the field width.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
An optional \fIlength modifier\fR that specified the size of the argument.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A \fIconversion specifier\fR that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.
.RE
.sp
.LP
A field width, or precision, or both can be indicated by an asterisk (\fB*\fR) . In this case, an argument of type \fBint\fR supplies the field width or precision. Arguments specifying field width, or precision, or both must appear in that order before the argument, if any, to be converted. A negative field width is taken as a \(mi flag followed by a positive field width. A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted. In format strings containing the \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR form of a conversion specification, a field width or precision may be indicated by the sequence \fB*\fR\fIm\fR\fB$\fR, where \fIm\fR is a decimal integer in the range [1, \fBNL_ARGMAX\fR] giving the position in the argument list (after the format argument) of an integer argument containing the field width or precision, for example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
printf("%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$d\en", hour, min, precision, sec);
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fIformat\fR can contain either numbered argument specifications (that is, \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR and \fB*\fR\fIm\fR\fB$\fR), or unnumbered argument specifications (that is, \fB%\fR and \fB*\fR), but normally not both. The only exception to this is that \fB%%\fR can be mixed with the \fB%\fR\fIn\fR\fB$\fR form. The results of mixing numbered and unnumbered argument specifications in a \fIformat\fR string are undefined. When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the \fIN\fRth argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the (\fIN-1\fR)th, are specified in the format string.
.SS "Flag Characters"
.sp
.LP
The flag characters and their meanings are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\&'\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n

The integer portion of the result of a decimal conversion (\fB%i\fR, \fB%d\fR, \fB%u\fR, \fB%f\fR, \fB%F\fR, \fB%g\fR, or \fB%G\fR) will be formatted with thousands' grouping characters. For other conversions the behavior is undefined. The non-monetary grouping character is used.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The result of a signed conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -). The conversion will begin with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBspace\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign or if a signed conversion results in no characters, a space will be placed before the result. This means that if the \fBspace\fR and \fB+\fR flags both appear, the space flag will be ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB#\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
The value is to be converted to an alternate form. For \fBc\fR, \fBd\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBs\fR, and \fBu\fR conversions, the flag has no effect. For an \fBo\fR conversion, it increases the precision (if necessary) to force the first digit of the result to be a zero. For \fBx\fR or \fBX\fR conversion, a non-zero result will have \fB0x\fR (or \fB0X\fR) prepended to it. For \fBa\fR, \fBA\fR, \fBe\fR, \fBE\fR, \fBf\fR, \fBF\fR, \fBg\fR, and \fBG\fR conversions, the result will always contain a radix character, even if no digits follow the radix character. Without this flag, the radix character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. For \fBg\fR and \fBG\fR conversions, trailing zeros will not be removed from the result as they normally are.

If the \fB0\fR and \fB\(mi\fR flags both appear, the \fB0\fR flag will be ignored. For \fBd\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBo\fR, \fBu\fR, \fBx\fR, and \fBX\fR conversions, if a precision is specified, the \fB0\fR flag will be ignored. If the \fB0\fR and \fB\&'\fR flags both appear, the grouping characters are inserted before zero padding. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.

The argument must be a pointer to an array of \fBchar\fR. Bytes from the array are written up to (but not including) any terminating null byte. If a precision is specified, a standard-conforming application (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) will write only the number of bytes specified by precision; an application that is not standard-conforming will write only the portion of the string that will display in the number of columns of screen display specified by precision. If the precision is not specified, it is taken to be infinite, so all bytes up to the first null byte are printed. An argument with a null value will yield undefined results.

If an \fBl\fR (ell) qualifier is present, the argument must be a pointer to an array of type \fBwchar_t\fR. Wide-characters from the array are converted to characters (each as if by a call to the \fBwcrtomb\fR(3C) function, with the conversion state described by an \fBmbstate_t\fR object initialized to zero before the first wide-character is converted) up to and including a terminating null wide-character. The resulting characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character (byte). If no precision is specified, the array must contain a null wide-character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many characters (bytes) are written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array must contain a null wide-character if, to equal the character sequence length given by the precision, the function would need to access a wide-character one past the end of the array. In no case is a partial character written.

In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is simply expanded to contain the conversion result.

The \fBsnprintf()\fR function returns the number of bytes that would have been written to \fIs\fR if \fIn\fR had been sufficiently large (excluding the terminating null byte.) If the value of \fIn\fR is 0 on a call to \fBsnprintf()\fR, \fIs\fR can be a null pointer and the number of bytes that would have been written if \fIn\fR had been sufficiently large (excluding the terminating null byte) is returned.

In addition, the C language supports character sequences of the form
.sp
.LP
\eoctal-number
.sp
.LP
and
.sp
.LP
\ehex-number
.sp
.LP
which translates into the character represented by the octal or hexadecimal number. For example, if ASCII representations are being used, the letter 'a' may be written as '\e141' and 'Z' as '\e132'. This syntax is most frequently used to represent the null character as '\e0'. This is exactly equivalent to the numeric constant zero (0). Note that the octal number does not include the zero prefix as it would for a normal octal constant. To specify a hexadecimal number, omit the zero so that the prefix is an 'x' (uppercase 'X' is not allowed in this context). Support for hexadecimal sequences is an ANSI extension. See \fBstandards\fR(5).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If the \fBj\fR length modifier is used, 32-bit applications that were compiled using \fBc89\fR on releases prior to Solaris 10 will experience undefined behavior.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsnprintf()\fR return value when \fIn\fR = 0 was changed in the Solaris 10 release. The change was based on the SUSv3 specification. The previous behavior was based on the initial SUSv2 specification, where \fBsnprintf()\fR when \fIn\fR = 0 returns an unspecified value less than 1.
