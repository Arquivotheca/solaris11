.TH dirname 3C "18 Mar 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
dirname \- report the parent directory name of a file path name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <libgen.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBdirname\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdirname()\fR function takes a pointer to a character string that contains a pathname, and returns a pointer to a string that is a pathname of the parent directory of that file.  Trailing '/' characters in the path are not counted as part of the path.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpath\fR does not contain a '/', then \fBdirname()\fR returns a pointer to the string "." .  If \fIpath\fR is a null pointer or points to an empty string, \fBdirname()\fR returns a pointer to the string "." .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBdirname()\fR function returns a pointer to a string that is the parent directory of \fIpath\fR. If \fIpath\fR is a null pointer or points to an empty string, a pointer to a string "." is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRChanging the Current Directory to the Parent Directory.
.sp
.LP
The following code fragment reads a pathname, changes the current working directory to the parent directory of the named file (see \fBchdir\fR(2)), and opens the file.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
char path[[MAXPATHLEN], *pathcopy;
int fd;
fgets(path, MAXPATHLEN, stdin);
pathcopy = strdup(path);
chdir(dirname(pathcopy));
fd = open(basename(path), O_RDONLY);
.fi

\fBExample 2 \fRSample Input and Output Strings for \fBdirname()\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the following table, the input string is the value pointed to by \fIpath\fR, and the output string is the return value of the \fBdirname()\fR function.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBdirname()\fR function modifies the string pointed to by \fIpath\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdirname()\fR and \fBbasename\fR(3C) functions together yield a complete pathname.  The expression \fBdirname(\fR\fIpath\fR\fB)\fR obtains the pathname of the directory where \fBbasename(\fR\fIpath\fR\fB)\fR is found.
