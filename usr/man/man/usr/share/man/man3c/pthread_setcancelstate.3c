.TH pthread_setcancelstate 3C "22 Jan 2008" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_setcancelstate \- enable or disable cancellation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_setcancelstate\fR(\fBint\fR \fIstate\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIoldstate\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setcancelstate()\fR function atomically sets the calling thread's cancellation state to the specified \fIstate\fR and if \fIoldstate\fR is not \fINULL\fR, stores the previous cancellation \fIstate\fR in \fIoldstate\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIstate\fR can be either of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This is the default. When cancellation is deferred (deferred cancellation is also the default), cancellation occurs when the target thread reaches a cancellation point and a cancel is pending. When cancellation is asynchronous, receipt of a  \fBpthread_cancel\fR(3C) call causes immediate cancellation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When cancellation is deferred, all cancellation requests to the target thread are held pending. When cancellation is asynchronous, all cancellation requests to the target thread are held pending; as soon as cancellation is re-enabled, pending cancellations are executed immediately.
.RE

.sp
.LP
See \fBcancellation\fR(5) for the definition of a cancellation point and a discussion of cancellation concepts. See \fBpthread_setcanceltype\fR(3C) for explanations of deferred and asynchronous cancellation.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_setcancelstate()\fR, returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_setcancelstate()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The specified \fIstate\fR is not \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE\fR or \fBPTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE\fR.
