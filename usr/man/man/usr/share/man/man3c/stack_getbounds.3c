.SH NAME
stack_getbounds \- retrieve stack boundaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ucontext.h>

\fBint\fR \fBstack_getbounds\fR(\fBstack_t *\fR\fIsp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_getbounds()\fR function retrieves the stack boundaries that the calling thread is currently operating on. If the thread is currently operating on the alternate signal stack, this function will retrieve the bounds of that stack.
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBstack_getbounds()\fR sets the \fBss_sp\fR member of the \fBstack_t\fR structure pointed to by \fIsp\fR to the base of the stack region and the \fBss_size\fR member to its size (maximum extent) in bytes. The \fBss_flags\fR member is set to \fBSS_ONSTACK\fR if the calling thread is executing on its alternate signal stack, and zero otherwise.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBstack_getbounds()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBstack_getbounds()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIsp\fR argument does not refer to a valid address.
