\fBint\fR \fBscandir\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIdirname\fR, \fBstruct dirent *\fR(*\fInamelist\fR[]),
     \fBint\fR (*\fIselect\fR)(const struct dirent *),

     \fBconst struct dirent **\fR));

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR function reads the directory \fIdirname\fR using \fBreaddir\fR(3C) and builds an array of pointers to directory entries using \fBmalloc\fR(3C). The \fInamelist\fR argument is a pointer to an array of structure pointers. The \fIselect\fR argument is a pointer to a routine that is called with a pointer to a directory entry and returns a non-zero value if the directory entry is included in the array. If this pointer is \fINULL\fR, then all the directory entries are included. The \fIdcomp\fR argument is a pointer to a routine that is passed to \fBqsort\fR(3C), which sorts the completed array. If this pointer is \fINULL\fR, the array is not sorted.
.sp
.LP
The \fBalphasort()\fR function can be used as the \fIdcomp\fR() function parameter for the \fBscandir()\fR function to sort the directory entries into alphabetical order, as if by the \fBstrcoll\fR(3C) function. Its arguments are the two directory entries to compare.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR function returns the number of entries in the array and a pointer to the array through the \fInamelist\fR argument. When an error is encountered, \fBscandir()\fR returns -1 and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBalphasort()\fR function returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0 if the directory entry name pointed to by \fId1\fR is greater than, equal to, or less than the directory entry name pointed to by \fId2\fR when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current locale. There is no return value reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEOVERFLOW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
The number of directory entries exceeds the number that can be represented by an \fBint\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBscandir()\fR and \fBalphasort()\fR functions have transitional interfaces for 64-bit file offsets. See \fBlf64\fR(5).
