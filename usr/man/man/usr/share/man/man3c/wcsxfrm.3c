.SH NAME
wcsxfrm, wsxfrm \- wide character string transformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h> 

\fBsize_t\fR \fBwcsxfrm\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBsize_t\fR \fBwsxfrm\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwcsxfrm()\fR functions transform the wide character string pointed to by \fIws2\fR and place the resulting wide character string into the array pointed to by \fIws1\fR. The transformation is such that if either the \fBwcscmp\fR(3C) or \fBwscmp\fR(3C) functions are applied to two transformed wide strings, they return a value greater than, equal to, or less than 0, corresponding to the result of the  \fBwcscoll\fR(3C) or \fBwscoll\fR(3C) function applied to the same two original wide character strings. No more than  \fIn\fR wide-character codes are placed into the resulting array pointed to by \fIws1\fR, including the terminating null wide-character code. If \fIn\fR is 0, \fIws1\fR is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwsxfrm()\fR functions do not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if successful.
.sp
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, then call \fBwcsxfrm()\fR or \fBwsxfrm()\fR, then check \fBerrno\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwsxfrm()\fR functions return the length of the transformed wide character string (not including the terminating null wide-character code). If the value returned is \fIn\fR or more, the contents of the array pointed to by \fIws1\fR are indeterminate.
.sp
.LP
On error, \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwsxfrm()\fR may set \fBerrno\fR but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwsxfrm()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The wide character string pointed to by \fIws2\fR contains wide-character codes outside the domain of the collating sequence.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The transformation function is such that  two transformed wide character strings can be ordered by the \fBwcscmp()\fR or \fBwscmp()\fR functions as appropriate to collating sequence information in the program's locale (category \fBLC_COLLATE\fR).
.sp
.LP
The fact that when  \fIn\fR is 0, \fIws1\fR is permitted to be a null pointer,  is useful to determine the size of the  \fIws1\fR array prior to making the transformation.

The \fBwcsxfrm()\fR and \fBwsxfrm()\fR functions can be used safely in multithreaded applications as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
