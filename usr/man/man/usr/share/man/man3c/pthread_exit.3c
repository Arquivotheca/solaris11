.TH pthread_exit 3C "2 Nov 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
pthread_exit \- terminate calling thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBpthread_exit\fR(\fBvoid *\fR\fIvalue_ptr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_exit()\fR function terminates the calling thread, in a similar way that \fBexit\fR(3C) terminates the calling process. If the thread is not detached, the exit status specified by  \fIvalue_ptr\fR is made  available to any successful join with the terminating thread. See \fBpthread_join\fR(3C). Any cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and not yet popped are popped in the reverse order that they were pushed and then executed. After all cancellation cleanup handlers have been executed, if the thread has any thread-specific data, appropriate destructor functions will be called in an unspecified order. Thread termination does not release any application visible process resources, including, but not limited to, mutexes and file descriptors, nor does it perform any process level cleanup actions, including, but not limited to, calling any \fBatexit()\fR routines that might exist.
.sp
.LP
An exiting thread runs with all signals blocked. All thread termination functions, including cancellation cleanup handlers and thread-specific data destructor functions, are called with all signals blocked.
.sp
.LP
An implicit call to \fBpthread_exit()\fR is made when a thread other than the thread in which \fBmain()\fR was first invoked returns from the start routine that was used to create it. The function's return value serves as the thread's exit status.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of \fBpthread_exit()\fR is undefined if called from a cancellation cleanup handler or destructor function that was invoked as a result of either an implicit or explicit call to \fBpthread_exit()\fR. 
.sp
.LP
After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local (auto) variables of the thread is undefined. Thus, references to local variables of the exiting thread should not be used for the \fBpthread_exit()\fR \fIvalue_ptr\fR parameter value.
.sp
.LP
The process exits with an exit status of  \fB0\fR after the last thread has been terminated. The behavior is as if the implementation called \fBexit()\fR with a \fB0\fR argument at thread termination time.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_exit()\fR function cannot return to its caller.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
