.TH mbtowc 3C "1 Nov 2003" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mbtowc \- convert a character to a wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBmbtowc\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIpwc\fR, \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbtowc()\fR determines the number of the bytes that constitute the character pointed to by \fIs\fR. It then determines the wide-character code for the value of type \fBwchar_t\fR that corresponds to that character. (The value of the wide-character code corresponding to the null byte is 0.) If the character is valid and \fIpwc\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbtowc()\fR stores the wide-character code in the object pointed to by \fIpwc\fR.
.sp
.LP
A call with \fIs\fR as a null pointer causes this function to return \fB0\fR. The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the current locale. At most \fIn\fR bytes of the array pointed to by \fIs\fR will be examined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, \fBmbtowc()\fR returns \fB0\fR. If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbtowc()\fR returns \fB0\fR (if \fIs\fR points to the null byte), the number of bytes that constitute the converted character (if the next \fIn\fR or fewer bytes form a valid character), or  \fB\(mi1\fR and may set \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error (if they do not form a valid character).
.sp
.LP
In no case will the value returned be greater than \fIn\fR or the value of the \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR macro.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbtowc()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Invalid character sequence is detected.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBmbtowc()\fR function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is not being called to change the locale.
