.TH tcsendbreak 3C "14 Aug 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Standard C Library Functions"
.SH NAME
tcsendbreak \- send a ``break'' for a specific duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h> 

\fBint\fR \fBtcsendbreak\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIduration\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.sp
.LP
If the terminal is using asynchronous serial data transmission, \fBtcsendbreak()\fR will cause transmission of a continuous stream of zero-valued bits for a specific duration.  If \fIduration\fR is 0, it will cause transmission of zero-valued bits for at least 0.25 seconds, and not more than 0.5 seconds.  If \fIduration\fR is not 0, it behaves in a way similar to \fBtcdrain\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data transmission, it sends data to generate a break condition or returns without taking any action.
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcsendbreak()\fR from a process which is a member of a background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling terminal will cause the process group to be sent a \fBSIGTTOU\fR signal. If the calling process is blocking or ignoring \fBSIGTTOU\fR signals, the process is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcsendbreak()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBtcsendbreak()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or blocking \fBSIGTTOU\fR.
