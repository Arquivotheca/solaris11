.SH NAME
getrusage \- get information about resource utilization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/resource.h>

\fBint\fR \fBgetrusage\fR(\fBint\fR \fIwho\fR, \fBstruct rusage *\fR\fIr_usage\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetrusage()\fR function provides measures of the resources used by the current process, its terminated and waited-for child processes, or the current light weight process (LWP).  If the value of the \fIwho\fR argument is \fBRUSAGE_SELF\fR, information is returned about resources used by the current process. If the value of the \fIwho\fR argument is \fBRUSAGE_CHILDREN\fR, information is returned about resources used by the terminated and waited-for children of the current process. If the child is never waited for (for instance, if the parent has \fBSA_NOCLDWAIT\fR set or sets \fBSIGCHLD\fR to \fBSIG_IGN\fR), the resource information for the child process is discarded and not included in the resource information provided by \fBgetrusage()\fR. If the value of the \fIwho\fR argument is \fBRUSAGE_LWP\fR, information is returned about resources used by the current LWP.
.sp
.LP
The \fIr_usage\fR argument is a pointer to an object of type \fBstruct\fR \fBrusage\fR in which the returned information is stored.  The members of \fBrusage\fR are as follows:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBru_maxrss\fR, \fBru_ixrss\fR, \fBru_idrss\fR, and \fBru_isrss\fR members of the \fBrusage\fR structure are set to 0 in this implementation.
.sp
.LP
The numbers \fBru_inblock\fR and \fBru_oublock\fR account only for real I/O, and are approximate measures at best. Data supplied by the cache mechanism is charged only to the first process to read and the last process to write the data.
.sp
.LP
The way resident set size is calculated is an approximation, and could misrepresent the true resident set size.
.sp
.LP
Page faults can be generated from a variety of sources and for a variety of reasons. The customary cause for a page fault is a direct reference by the program to a page which is not in memory.  Now, however, the kernel can generate page faults on behalf of the user, for example, servicing \fBread\fR(2) and \fBwrite\fR(2) functions. Also, a page fault can be caused by an absent hardware translation to a page, even though the page is in physical memory.
.sp
.LP
In addition to hardware detected page faults, the kernel may cause pseudo page faults in order to perform some housekeeping.  For example, the kernel may generate page faults, even if the pages exist in physical memory, in order to lock down pages involved in a raw I/O request.
.sp
.LP
By definition, major page faults require physical I/O, while minor page faults do not require physical I/O. For example, reclaiming the page from the free list would avoid I/O and generate a minor page fault. More commonly, minor page faults occur during process startup as references to pages which are already in memory. For example, if an address space faults on some "hot" executable or shared library, this results in a minor page fault for the address space. Also, any one doing a \fBread\fR(2) or \fBwrite\fR(2) to something that is in the page cache will get a minor page fault(s) as well.
.sp
.LP
There is no way to obtain information about a child process which has not yet terminated.
