.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkbd\fR utility manipulates the state of the keyboard, or displays the keyboard type, or allows the default keyboard abort sequence effect to be changed. The abort sequence also applies to serial console devices. The \fBkbd\fR utility sets the \fB/dev/kbd\fR default keyboard device.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB-i\fR option reads and processes default values  for the \fBkeyclick\fR and \fBkeyboard\fR abort settings from the  keyboard configuration service, \fBsvc:/system/keymap:default\fR. Only keyboards that support a clicker respond to the \fB-c\fR option. To turn clicking on by default, add or change the value of the \fBkeymap/keyclick\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/keyclick=true
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Next, run the command \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR to change the setting. Valid settings for the \fBkeymap/keyclick\fR  property are \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR. All other  values are ignored. If the \fBkeymap/keyclick\fR property is not specified in the \fBkeymap\fR service, the setting is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
The keyboard abort sequence effect can only be changed by a super user using the \fB-a\fR option. This sequence is typically Stop-A or L1-A and Shift-Pause on the keyboard on \fBSPARC\fR systems, F1-A and Shift-Pause on x86 systems, and BREAK on the serial console input device on most systems.
.sp
.LP
A \fBBREAK\fR condition that originates from an erroneous electrical signal cannot be distinguished from one deliberately sent by remote \fBDCE\fR. As a remedy, use the \fB-a\fR option with Alternate Break to switch break interpretation. Due to the risk of incorrect sequence interpretation, binary protocols such as \fBSLIP\fR and others should not be run over the serial console port when Alternate Break sequence is in effect. 
.sp
.LP
Although PPP is a binary protocol, it has the ability to avoid using characters that interfere with serial operation. The default alternate break sequence is CTRL-m \fB~\fR CTRL-b, or \fB0D 7E 02\fR in hexidecimal. In PPP, this can be avoided by setting either \fB0x00000004\fR or \fB0x00002000\fR in the ACCM. This forces an escape for the CTRL-b or CTRL-m characters, respectively.
.sp
.LP
To do this in Solaris PPP 4.0, add:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
asyncmap 0x00002000
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
to the \fB/etc/ppp/options\fR file or any of the other configuration files used for the connection. See \fBpppd\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
SLIP has no comparable capability, and must not be used if the Alternate Break sequence is in use. 
.sp
.LP
The Alternate Break sequence has no effect on the keyboard abort. For more information on the Alternate Break sequence, see \fBzs\fR(7D),\fBse\fR(7D), and \fBasy\fR(7D). 
.sp
.LP
On many systems, the default effect of the keyboard abort sequence is to suspend the operating system and enter the debugger or the monitor. Some systems feature key switches with a \fBsecure\fR position. On these systems, setting the key switch to the \fBsecure\fR position overrides any software default set with this command.
.sp
.LP
To permanently change the software default effect of the keyboard abort sequence, first add or change the value of the \fBkeymap/keyboard_abort\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/keyboard_abort=disable
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Next, run the command \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR to change the setting. Valid settings are \fBenable\fR, \fBdisable\fR, and \fBalternate\fR; all other values are ignored. If the variable is not specified in the \fBkeymap\fR service, the setting is unchanged.
.sp
.LP
To set the abort sequence to the hardware \fBBREAK\fR, set the value of \fBkeymap/keyboard_abort\fR in the \fBkeymap\fR service to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/keyboard_abort=enable
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To change the current setting, run the command \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR. To set the abort sequence to the Alternate Break character sequence, first set the current value of the \fBkeyboard_abort\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/keyboard_abort=alternate
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Next, run the command \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR to change the setting. When the Alternate Break sequence is in effect, only serial console devices are affected.
.sp
.LP
To set the autorepeat delay by default, set the \fBrepeat_delay\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to the expected value with units in milliseconds (\fBms\fR). To avoid making the keyboard unusable due to a typographical error, delay values below \fBKIOCRPTDELAY_MIN\fR (defined in \fB/usr/include/sys/kbio.h\fR) are rejected with \fBEINVAL\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/repeate_delay=500
$ svcadm refresh keymap
 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To set the autorepeat rate by default, set the \fBrepeat_rate\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to the expected value with units in milliseconds. Negative and zero repeat rates are ejected with \fBEINVAL\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/repeate_rate=40
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To change the current settings of \fIdelay\fR and \fIrate\fR, run the command, \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR. When the Auto Repeat Delay and/or Auto Repeat Rate are in effect, only command line mode is affected.
.sp
.LP
To set the language by default, set the \fBkeymap/layout\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to the expected language. These languages supported in kernel can be found by running \fBkbd -s\fR. Other values are ignored. For example, the following sets Spanish layout to the keyboard:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/layout=Spanish
$ svcadm refresh keymap
 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Next, run the \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR to change the setting. When Solaris reboots, the Spanish key table is loaded into kernel. These layouts are valid for \fBusb\fR and \fBps/2\fR keyboards. 
.sp
.LP
To set the keyboard beeper frequency by default, set the \fBkeymap/kbd_beeper_freq\fR  property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to the expected value with units in HZ. This value should be between \fB0\fR and \fB32767\fR, inclusive. Otherwise it is rejected with \fBEINVAL\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/kbd_beeper_freq=2000
$ svcadm refresh keymap
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To set the console beeper frequency by default, set the \fBkeymap/console_beeper_freq\fR property in the \fBkeymap\fR service to the expected value with units in HZ. This value should be between \fB0\fR and \fB32767\fR, inclusive. Otherwise it is rejected with \fBEINVAL\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ svccfg -s keymap:default setprop keymap/console_beeper_freq=900
$ svcadm refresh keymap
 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To change the current settings of the keyboard beeper frequency and console beeper frequency, run \fBkbd\fR \fB-i\fR.

.sp
.LP
Some server systems have key switches with a \fBsecure\fR key position that can be read by system software. This key position overrides the normal default of the keyboard abort sequence effect and changes the default so the effect is disabled. When the key switch is in the \fBsecure\fR position on these systems, the keyboard abort sequence effect cannot be overridden by the software default, which is settable with the \fBkbd\fR utility.
.sp

Currently, there is no way to determine the state of the keyboard click setting.
