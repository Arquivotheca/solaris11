.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBacctcom\fR utility reads \fIfilename\fRs, the standard input, or \fB/var/adm/pacct\fR, in the form described by \fBacct.h\fR(3HEAD) and writes selected records to standard output. Each record represents the execution of one process. The output shows the \fBCOMMAND NAME\fR, \fBUSER\fR, \fBTTYNAME\fR, \fBSTART TIME\fR, \fBEND TIME\fR, \fBREAL (SEC)\fR, \fBCPU (SEC)\fR, \fBMEAN SIZE (K)\fR, and optionally, \fBF\fR (the \fBfork()\fR/\fBexec()\fR flag: \fB1\fR for \fBfork()\fR without \fBexec()\fR), \fBSTAT\fR (the system exit status), \fBHOG FACTOR\fR, \fBKCORE MIN\fR, \fBCPU FACTOR\fR, \fBCHARS TRNSFD\fR, and  \fBBLOCKS\fR \fBREAD\fR (total blocks read and written).
.sp
.LP
A  `\fB#\fR' is prepended to the command name if the command was executed with super-user privileges. If a process is not associated with a known terminal, a  `\fB?\fR' is printed in the \fBTTYNAME\fR field.
.sp
.LP
If no  \fIfilename\fR is specified, and if the standard input is associated with a terminal or \fB/dev/null\fR (as is the case when using `\fB&\fR\&' in the shell), \fB/var/adm/pacct\fR is read; otherwise, the standard input is read.
.sp
.LP
If any \fIfilename\fR arguments are given, they are read in their respective order. Each file is normally read forward, that is, in chronological order by process completion time. The file \fB/var/adm/pacct\fR is usually the current file to be examined; a busy system may need several such files of which all but the current file are found in \fB/var/adm/pacct\fIincr\fR\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Show some average statistics about the processes selected. The statistics will be printed after the output records.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Read backwards, showing latest commands first. This option has no effect when standard input is read.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad

.rt  
Print the \fBfork()\fR/\fBexec()\fR flag and system exit status columns in the output. The numeric output for this option will be in octal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Instead of mean memory size, show the fraction of total available \fBCPU\fR time consumed by the process during its execution. This "hog factor" is computed as (total \fBCPU\fR time)/(elapsed time).

.ad
.RS 18n

.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR

.ne 2
.mk
