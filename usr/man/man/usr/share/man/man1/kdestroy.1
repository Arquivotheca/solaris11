.SH NAME
kdestroy \- destroy Kerberos tickets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/kdestroy\fR [\fB-q\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIcache_name\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkdestroy\fR utility destroys the user's active Kerberos authorization tickets by writing zeros to the specified credentials cache that contains them. If the credentials cache is not specified, the default credentials cache is destroyed. If the credentials cache does not exist, \fBkdestroy\fR displays a message to that effect.
.sp
.LP
After overwriting the cache, \fBkdestroy\fR removes the cache from the system. The utility displays a message indicating the success or failure of the operation. If \fBkdestroy\fR is unable to destroy the cache, it will warn you by making your terminal beep.
.sp
.LP
If desired, you can place the \fBkdestroy\fR command in your \fB\&.logout\fR file so that your tickets are destroyed automatically when you logout.

.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
Only the tickets in the specified credentials cache are destroyed. Separate ticket caches are used to hold root instance and password changing tickets. These files should probably be destroyed too, or all of a user's tickets should be kept in a single credential cache.
