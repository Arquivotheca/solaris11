.LP
Using \fB+\fR rather than \fB\(mi\fR causes these flags to be turned off. These flags can also be used upon invocation of the shell. The current set of flags can be found in \fB$\(mi\fR. The remaining \fIargument\fRs are positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR, \fB\&.\|.\|.\|.\fR If no \fIargument\fRs are specified the values of all names are printed.
.sp
.LP
For each \fIname\fR, \fBunset\fR removes the corresponding variable or function value. The variables \fBPATH\fR, \fBPS1\fR, \fBPS2\fR, \fBMAILCHECK\fR, and \fBIF\fR cannot be unset.
.sp
.LP
With the \fBexport\fR built-in, the specified \fIname\fRs are marked for automatic export to the \fIenvironment\fR of subsequently executed commands. If no arguments are specified, variable names that have been marked for export during the current shell's execution are listed. Function names are \fBnot\fR exported.
.SS "csh"
.sp
.LP
With no arguments, \fBset\fR displays the values of all shell variables. Multiword values are displayed as a parenthesized list. With the \fIvar\fR argument alone, \fBset\fR assigns an empty (null) value to the variable \fIvar\fR. With arguments of the form \fIvar\fR \fB=\fR \fIvalue\fR \fBset\fR assigns \fIvalue\fR to \fIvar\fR, where \fIvalue\fR is one of:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIword\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A single word (or quoted string).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB(\fR\fIwordlist\fR\fB)\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
A space-separated list of words enclosed in parentheses.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Values are command and filename expanded before being assigned. The form \fBset\fR \fIvar\fR\fB[\fR\fIn\fR\fB]=\fR\fIword\fR replaces the \fIn\fR'th word in a multiword value with \fIword\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBunset\fR removes variables whose names match (filename substitution) \fIpattern\fR. All variables are removed by `\fBunset *\fR'.
.sp
.LP
With no arguments, \fBsetenv\fR displays all environment variables. With the \fIVAR\fR argument, \fBsetenv\fR sets the environment variable \fB\fR\fIVAR\fR\fB \fR to an empty (null) value. (By convention, environment variables are normally specified upper-case names.) With both \fIVAR\fR and \fIword\fR arguments specified, \fBsetenv\fR sets \fIVAR\fR to \fIword\fR, which must be either a single word or a quoted string. The \fBPATH\fR variable can take multiple \fIword\fR arguments, separated by colons (see EXAMPLES). The most commonly used environment variables, \fBUSER\fR, \fBTERM\fR, and \fBPATH\fR, are automatically imported to and exported from the \fBcsh\fR variables \fBuser\fR, \fBterm\fR, and \fBpath\fR. Use \fBsetenv\fR if you need to change these variables. In addition, the shell sets the \fBPWD\fR environment variable from the \fBcsh\fR variable \fBcwd\fR whenever the latter changes.
.sp
.LP
The environment variables \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_NUMERIC\fR, and \fBLC_MONETARY\fR take immediate effect when changed within the C shell. See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of these environment variables.
.sp
.LP
\fBunsetenv\fR removes \fIvariable\fR from the environment. As with \fBunset\fR, pattern matching is not performed.
.SS "ksh88"

The flags for the \fBset\fR built-in have meaning as follows:
.sp

\fBset\fR sets or unsets options and positional parameters. Options that are specified with a \fB-\fR cause the options to be set. Options that are specified with a \fB+\fR cause the option to be unset.

\fBset\fR without any options or arguments displays the names and values of all shell variables in the order of the collation sequence in the current locale. The values are quoted so that they are suitable for input again to the shell.

If no arguments are specified, not even the end of options argument \fB--\fR, the positional parameters are unchanged. Otherwise, unless the \fB-A\fR option has been specified, the positional parameters are replaced by the list of arguments. A first argument of \fB--\fR is ignored when setting positional parameters.
