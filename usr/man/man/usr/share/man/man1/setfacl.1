.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
For each file specified, \fBsetfacl\fR either replaces its entire \fBACL\fR, including the default \fBACL\fR on a directory, or it adds, modifies, or deletes one or more \fBACL\fR entries, including default entries on directories.
.sp
.LP
When the \fBsetfacl\fR command is used, it can result in changes to the file permission bits. When the user \fBACL\fR entry for the file owner is changed, the file owner class permission bits are modified. When the group \fBACL\fR entry for the file group class is changed, the file group class permission bits are modified. When the other \fBACL\fR entry is changed, the file other class permission bits are modified.
.sp
.LP
If you use the \fBchmod\fR(1) command to change the file group owner permissions on a file with \fBACL\fR entries, both the file group owner permissions and the \fBACL\fR mask are changed to the new permissions. Be aware that the new \fBACL\fR mask permissions can change the effective permissions for additional users and groups who have \fBACL\fR entries on the file.
.sp
.LP
A directory can contain default \fBACL\fR entries. If a file or directory is created in a directory that contains default \fBACL\fR entries, the newly created file has permissions generated according to the intersection of the default \fBACL\fR entries and the permissions requested at creation time. The \fBumask\fR(1) are not applied if the directory contains default \fBACL\fR entries. If a default \fBACL\fR is specified for a specific user (or users), the file has a regular \fBACL\fR created. Otherwise, only the mode bits are initialized according to the intersection described above. The default \fBACL\fR should be thought of as the maximum discretionary access permissions that can be granted.
.sp
.LP
Use the \fBsetfacl\fR command to set ACLs on files in a UFS file system, which supports POSIX-draft ACLS (or \fBaclent_t\fR style ACLs). Use the \fBchmod\fR command to set ACLs on files in a ZFS file system, which supports NFSv4-style ACLS (or \fBace_t\fR style ACLs).
.SS "\fIacl_entries\fR Syntax"
.sp
.LP
For the \fB-m\fR and \fB-s\fR options, \fIacl_entries\fR are one or more comma-separated \fBACL\fR entries.
.sp
.LP
An \fBACL\fR entry consists of the following fields separated by colons:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIentry_type\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Type of \fBACL\fR entry on which to set file permissions. For example, \fIentry_type\fR can be \fBuser\fR (the owner of a file) or \fBmask\fR (the \fBACL\fR mask).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIuid\fR or \fIgid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n

User name or user identification number. Or, group name or group identification number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.LP
For the \fB-d\fR option, \fIacl_entries\fR are one or more comma-separated \fBACL\fR entries without permissions. Notice that the entries for file owner, file group owner, \fBACL\fR mask, and others can not be deleted.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The options have the following meaning:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIacl_entries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Deletes one or more entries from the file. The entries for the file owner, the file group owner, and others can not be deleted from the \fBACL\fR. Notice that deleting an entry does not necessarily have the same effect as removing all permissions from the entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIacl_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Sets a file's \fBACL\fR with the \fBACL\fR entries contained in the file named \fIacl_file\fR. The same constraints on specified entries hold as with the \fB-s\fR option. The entries are not required to be in any specific order in the file. Also, if you specify a dash (\fB-\fR) for \fIacl_file\fR, standard input is used to set the file's \fBACL\fR.
.sp
The character \fB#\fR in \fIacl_file\fR can be used to indicate a comment. All characters, starting with the \fB#\fR until the end of the line, are ignored. Notice that if the \fIacl_file\fR has been created as the output of the \fBgetfacl\fR(1) command, any effective permissions, which follow a \fB#\fR, are ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fIacl_entries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Adds one or more new \fBACL\fR entries to the file, and/or modifies one or more existing \fBACL\fR entries on the file. If an entry already exists for a specified \fIuid\fR or \fIgid\fR, the specified permissions replace the current permissions. If an entry does not exist for the specified \fIuid\fR or \fIgid\fR, an entry is created. When using the \fB-m\fR option to modify a default \fBACL\fR, you must specify a complete default \fBACL\fR (user, group, other, mask, and any additional entries) the first time.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Recalculates the permissions for the \fBACL\fR mask entry. The permissions specified in the \fBACL\fR mask entry are ignored and replaced by the maximum permissions necessary to grant the access to all additional user, file group owner, and additional group entries in the \fBACL\fR. The permissions in the additional user, file group owner, and additional group entries are left unchanged.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIacl_entries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAdding read permission only
.sp
.LP
The following example adds one \fBACL\fR entry to file \fBabc\fR, which gives user \fBshea\fR read permission only.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBsetfacl -m user:shea:r\(mi\(mi abc\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRReplacing a file's entire \fBACL\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example replaces the entire \fBACL\fR for the file \fBabc\fR, which gives \fBshea\fR read access, the file owner all access, the file group owner read access only, the \fBACL\fR mask read access only, and others no access.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBsetfacl -s user:shea:rwx,user::rwx,group::rw-,mask:r--,other:--- abc\fR 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Notice that after this command, the file permission bits are \fBrwxr-----\fR. Even though the file group owner was set with read/write permissions, the \fBACL\fR mask entry limits it to have only read permission. The mask entry also specifies the maximum permissions available to all additional user and group \fBACL\fR entries. Once again, even though the user \fBshea\fR was set with all access, the mask limits it to have only read permission. The \fBACL\fR mask entry is a quick way to limit or open access to all the user and group entries in an \fBACL\fR. For example, by changing the mask entry to read/write, both the file group owner and user \fBshea\fR would be given read/write access.

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRSetting the same \fBACL\fR on two files
.sp
.LP
The following example sets the same \fBACL\fR on file \fBabc\fR as the file \fBxyz\fR.

\fBgetfacl xyz | setfacl -f \(mi abc\fR
