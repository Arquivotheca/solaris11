.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBiconv\fR utility converts the characters or sequences of characters in \fIfile\fR from one code set to another and writes the results to standard output. If no conversion exists for a particular character, an implementation-defined conversion is performed on this character.
.sp
.LP
The list of supported conversions and the locations of the associated conversion tables are provided in the \fBiconv\fR(5) manual page.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Omits any characters that are invalid in the codeset of the input file from the output. When \fB-c\fR is not used, the results of encountering invalid characters in the input stream depend on the specified codesets for the conversion. Invalid characters can be either those that are not valid characters in the codeset of the input file or those that have no corresponding character in the codeset of the output file. The presence or absence of \fB-c\fR does not affect the exit status of \fBiconv\fR. When \fIfromcode\fR is specified for the \fIfromcodeset\fR of the \fB-f\fR option or \fItocode\fR is specified for the \fItocodeset\fR of the \fB-t\fR option, the specification of \fB-c\fR may be ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfromcodeset\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Identifies the code set of the input file. The following two forms of the \fIfromcodeset\fR option-argument are recognized:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfromcode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The \fIfromcode\fR option-argument must not contain a	 slash (\fB/\fR) character. It is interpreted as the name of one of the codeset descriptions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfrommap\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The \fIfrommap\fR option-argument must contain a slash character. It is interpreted as the pathname of a charmap file as defined in \fBcharmap\fR(5). If the pathname does not represent a valid, readable charmap file, the results are undefined.
.RE

If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current locale is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Writes all supported \fIfromcode\fR and \fItocode\fR values to standard output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Suppresses any messages written to standard error concerning invalid characters. When \fB-s\fR is not used, the results of encountering invalid characters in the input stream depend on the specified codesets for the conversion. Invalid characters can be either those that are not valid characters in the codeset of the input file or those that have no corresponding character in the codeset of the output file. The presence or absence of \fB-s\fR does not affect the exit status of \fBiconv\fR. When \fIfromcode\fR is 	specified for the \fIfromcodeset\fR of the \fB-f\fR option or \fItocode\fR is specified for the \fItocodeset\fR of the \fB-t\fR option, the specification of \fB-s\fR may be ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItocodeset\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Identifies the code set used for the output file. The following two forms of the \fItocodeset\fR option-argument are recognized:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItocode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fItocode\fR option-argument must not contain a	 slash (\fB/\fR) character. It is interpreted as the name of one of the codeset descriptions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItomap\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The \fItomap\fR option-argument must contain a slash character. It is interpreted as the pathname of a charmap file as defined in \fBcharmap\fR(5). If the pathname does not represent a valid, readable charmap file, the results are undefined.
.RE

If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current locale is used.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If either \fB-f\fR or \fB-t\fR represents a charmap file but the other does not, or is omitted, or if both \fB-f\fR and \fB-t\fR are omitted, \fBiconv\fR fails as an error.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
A path name of an input file. If no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is '\fB-\fR', the standard input is used.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRConverting and storing files
.sp
.LP
The following example converts the contents of file \fBmail1\fR from code set \fB8859\fR to \fB646fr\fR and stores the results in file \fBmail.local\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf

.fi
.in -2

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Make sure that both charmap files use the same symbolic names for characters the two codesets have in common.
.sp
.LP
The output format of the \fB-l\fR option is unspecified. The \fB-l\fR option is 	not intended for shell script usage.
.sp
.LP
When \fIfromcode\fR or \fItocode\fR is specified for the codeset conversion, \fBiconv\fR uses the \fBiconv_open\fR(3C) function. If \fBiconv_open\fR(3C) fails to open the specified codeset conversion, \fBiconv\fR searches for an appropriate conversion table. As for the supported codeset conversion by \fBiconv_open\fR(3C), please refer to \fBiconv\fR(5) and \fBiconv_locale\fR(5).
