.SH NAME
sdiff \- print differences between two files side-by-side
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsdiff\fR uses the output of the \fBdiff\fR command to produce a side-by-side listing of two files indicating lines that are different. Lines of the two files are printed with a blank gutter between them if the lines are identical, a \fB<\fR in the gutter if the line appears only in \fIfilename1\fR, a \fB>\fR in the gutter if the line appears only in \fIfilename2\fR, and a \fB|\fR for lines that are different. (See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section below.)

Use the argument \fIoutput\fR as the name of a third file that is created as a user-controlled merge of \fIfilename1\fR and \fIfilename2\fR. Identical lines of \fIfilename1\fR and \fIfilename2\fR are copied to \fIoutput\fR. Sets of differences, as produced by \fBdiff\fR, are printed; where a set of differences share a common gutter character. After printing each set of differences, \fBsdiff\fR prompts the user with a \fB%\fR and waits for one of the following user-typed commands:

.SH USAGE

.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBsdiff\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
If any of the \fBLC_*\fR variables ( \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_NUMERIC\fR, and \fBLC_MONETARY\fR ) (see \fBenviron\fR(5)) are not set in the environment, the operational behavior of \fBsdiff\fR for each corresponding locale category is determined by the value of the \fBLANG\fR environment variable.  If \fBLC_ALL\fR is set, its contents are used to override both the \fBLANG\fR and the other \fBLC_*\fR variables.  If none of the above variables is set in the environment, the "C" locale determines how \fBsdiff\fR behaves.
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBLC_CTYPE\fR \fR

.RS 13n
.rt  
Determines how \fBsdiff\fR handles characters. When \fBLC_CTYPE\fR is set to a valid value, \fBsdiff\fR can display and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale.
