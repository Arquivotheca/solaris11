.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBftp\fR command is the user interface to the \fBInternet\fR standard File Transfer Protocol (\fBFTP\fR). \fBftp\fR transfers files to and from a remote network site.
.sp
.LP
The host and optional port with which \fBftp\fR is to communicate can be specified on the command line. If this is done, \fBftp\fR immediately attempts to establish a connection to an \fBFTP\fR server on that host. Otherwise, \fBftp\fR enters its command interpreter and awaits instructions from the user. When \fBftp\fR is awaiting commands from the user, it displays the prompt \fBftp>\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options can be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter:

.RS 14n
.rt  
Specifies the \fBGSS\fR-\fBAPI\fR mechanism to use. The default is to use the kerberos_v5 mechanism. Supported alternatives are defined in \fB/etc/gss/mech\fR (see \fBmech\fR(4)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Does not attempt "auto-login" upon initial connection. If auto-login is not disabled, \fBftp\fR checks the \fB\&.netrc\fR file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an account on the remote machine. If no entry exists, \fBftp\fR prompts for the login name of the account on the remote machine (the default is the login name on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompts for a password and an account with which to login.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Skips the \fBSYST\fR command that is sent by default to all remote servers upon connection. The system command is what enables the automatic use of binary mode rather than the protocol default ascii mode. 
.sp
As some older servers cannot handle the \fBftp\fR command, this directive is provided to allow inter-operability with these servers.

Toggles RETURN stripping during "network \fBASCII\fR" type file retrieval. Records are denoted by a RETURN/\fBLINEFEED\fR sequence during "network \fBASCII\fR" type file transfer. When \fBcr\fR is on (the default), RETURN characters are stripped from this sequence to conform with the UNIX system single \fBLINEFEED\fR record delimiter. Records on non-UNIX-system remote hosts can contain single \fBLINEFEED\fR characters; when an "network \fBASCII\fR" type transfer is made, these \fBLINEFEED\fR characters can be distinguished from a record delimiter only when \fBcr\fR is off.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Toggles filename expansion, or "globbing", for \fBmdelete\fR, \fBmget\fR and \fBmput\fR. If globbing is turned off, filenames are taken literally.
.sp
Globbing for \fBmput\fR is done as in \fBsh\fR(1). For \fBmdelete\fR and \fBmget\fR, each remote file name is expanded separately on the remote machine, and the lists are not merged.
.sp
Expansion of a directory name is likely to be radically different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact result depends on the remote operating system and \fBFTP\fR server, and can be previewed with the command, \fBmls\fR \fIremote-files\fR \(mi.
.sp
\fBmget\fR and \fBmput\fR are not meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files. You can do this by transferring a \fBtar\fR(1) archive of the subtree (using a "representation type" of "image" as set by the \fBbinary\fR command).

\fB\fBls\fR [ \fB-al\fR | \fIremote-directory\fR [ \fIlocal-file\fR ]]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
By default, prints an abbreviated listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine. This default behavior can be changed to make \fBls\fR a synonym of the \fBdir\fR command. This change can be achieved by setting \fBFTP_LS_SENDS_NLST\fR to '\fBno\fR' in \fB/etc/default/ftp\fR or in the environment. See \fBftp\fR(4) for details.
.sp
The \fB-a\fR option lists all entries, including those that begin with a dot (\fB\&.\fR), which are normally not listed. The \fB-l\fR option lists files in long format, giving mode, number of links, owner, group, size in bytes, and time of last modification for each file. If the file is a special file, the size field instead contains the major and minor device numbers rather than a size. If the file is a symbolic link, the filename is printed followed by "\fB\(->\fR" and the pathname of the referenced file.
.sp
If \fIremote-directory\fR is left unspecified, the current working directory is used.
.sp
If no local file is specified, or if \fIlocal-file\fR is \fB\(mi\fR, the output is sent to the terminal.

.RS 4n
Defines a macro. Subsequent lines are stored as the macro \fImacro-name\fR. A null line (consecutive \fBNEWLINE\fR characters in a file or RETURN characters from the terminal) terminates macro input mode. There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in all defined macros. Macros remain defined until a \fBclose\fR command is executed.
.sp
The macro processor interprets \fB$\fR and \fB\e\fR as special characters. A \fB$\fR followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument on the macro invocation command line. A \fB$\fR followed by an \fBi\fR signals that macro processor that the executing macro is to be looped. On the first pass, \fB$i\fR is replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation command line; on the second pass, it is replaced by the second argument, and so on. A \fB\e\fR followed by any character is replaced by that character. Use the \fB\e\fR to prevent special treatment of the \fB$\fR.

Prints an abbreviated listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine, listing only those files that can be retrieved by the \fBget\fR command, unless the \fB-a\fR or \fB-l\fR option is used. If \fIremote-directory\fR is left unspecified, the current working directory is used.
.sp
The \fB-a\fR option lists all entries, including those that begin with a dot (\fB\&.\fR), which are normally not listed. The \fB-l\fR option lists files in long format the same way it does when used with the \fBls\fR command.

\fB\fBnmap\fR [ \fIinpattern outpattern\fR ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets or unsets the filename mapping mechanism. If no arguments are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset. If arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during \fBmput\fR commands and \fBput\fR commands issued without a specified remote target filename. If arguments are specified, local filenames are mapped during \fBmget\fR commands and \fBget\fR commands issued without a specified local target filename.
.sp
This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX-system remote host with different file naming conventions or practices. The mapping follows the pattern set by \fIinpattern\fR and \fIoutpattern\fR. \fIinpattern\fR is a template for incoming filenames (which can have already been processed according to the \fBntrans\fR and \fBcase\fR settings). Variable templating is accomplished by including the sequences \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR, .\|.\|.\|, \fB$9\fR in \fIinpattern\fR. Use \fB\e\fR to prevent this special treatment of the \fB$\fR character. All other characters are treated literally, and are used to determine the \fBnmap\fR \fIinpattern\fR variable values.
.sp
For example, given \fIinpattern\fR \fB$1.$2\fR and the remote file name \fBmydata.data\fR, \fB$1\fR would have the value \fBmydata\fR, and \fB$2\fR would have the value \fBdata\fR.
.sp
The \fIoutpattern\fR determines the resulting mapped filename. The sequences \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR, .\|.\|.\|, \fB$9\fR are replaced by any value resulting from the \fIinpattern\fR template. The sequence \fB$0\fR is replaced by the original filename. Additionally, the sequence [\fI\|seq1\|\fR,\fI\|seq2\|\fR] is replaced by \fIseq1\fR if \fIseq1\fR is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by \fIseq2\fR.
.sp
For example, the command \fBnmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]\fR would yield the output filename \fBmyfile.data\fR for input filenames \fBmyfile.data\fR and \fBmyfile.data.old\fR, \fBmyfile.file\fR for the input filename \fBmyfile\fR, and \fBmyfile.myfile\fR for the input filename \fB\&.myfile\fR. \fBSPACE\fR characters can be included in \fIoutpattern\fR, as in the example \fBnmap $1 | sed "s/ *$//" > $1\fR. Use the \fB\e\fR character to prevent special treatment of the \fB$\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB]\fR, and \fB,\fR, characters.

Sets or unsets the filename character translation mechanism. If no arguments are specified, the filename character translation mechanism is unset. If arguments are specified, characters in remote filenames are translated during \fBmput\fR commands and \fBput\fR commands issued without a specified remote target filename, and characters in local filenames are translated during \fBmget\fR commands and \fBget\fR commands issued without a specified local target filename.
.sp
This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX-system remote host with different file naming conventions or practices. Characters in a filename matching a character in \fIinchars\fR are replaced with the corresponding character in \fIoutchars\fR. If the character's position in \fIinchars\fR is longer than the length of \fIoutchars\fR, the character is deleted from the file name.

Toggles passive mode.

The remote server listens on that port and the client connects to it. When passive mode is turned off, the ftp client sends the \fBPORT\fR command to the server specifying an address for the remote server to connect back to. Passive mode is useful when the connections to the ftp client are controlled, for example, when behind a firewall. When connecting to an IPv6-enabled \fBFTP\fR server, \fBEPSV\fR can be used in place of \fBPASV\fR and \fBEPRT\fR in place of \fBPORT\fR.

The \fBreget\fR command acts like \fBget\fR, except that if \fIlocal-file\fR exists and is smaller than \fIremote-file\fR, \fIlocal-file\fR is presumed to be a partially transferred copy of \fIremote-file\fR and the transfer is continued from the apparent point of failure.

Toggles the use of \fBPORT\fR commands. By default, \fBftp\fR attempts to use a \fBPORT\fR command when establishing a connection for each data transfer. The use of \fBPORT\fR commands can prevent delays when performing multiple file transfers. If the \fBPORT\fR command fails, \fBftp\fR uses the default data port. When the use of \fBPORT\fR commands is disabled, no attempt is made to use \fBPORT\fR commands for each data transfer. This is useful when connected to certain \fBFTP\fR implementations that ignore \fBPORT\fR commands but incorrectly indicate they have been accepted.

.SH ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER
.sp
.LP
To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key. Sending transfers is immediately halted. Receiving transfers are halted by sending an \fBFTP\fR protocol \fBABOR\fR command to the remote server, and discarding any further data received. The speed at which this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for \fBABOR\fR processing. If the remote server does not support the \fBABOR\fR command, an \fBftp>\fR prompt does not appear until the remote server has completed sending the requested file.
.sp
.LP
The terminal interrupt key sequence is ignored when \fBftp\fR has completed any local processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote server. A long delay in this mode can result from the \fBABOR\fR processing described above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server, including violations of the ftp protocol. If the delay results from unexpected remote server behavior, the local \fBftp\fR program must be killed by hand.

If the shell command includes SPACE characters, the argument must be quoted; for example, \fB| ls\fR \fB-lt\fR. A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: \fB"dir | more"\fR.

.SH FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The \fBFTP\fR specification specifies many parameters which can affect a file transfer.
.sp
.LP
The "representation type" can be one of "network \fBASCII\fR", "\fBEBCDIC\fR", "image", or "local byte size" with a specified byte size (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly). The "network \fBASCII\fR" and "\fBEBCDIC\fR" types have a further subtype which specifies whether vertical format control (\fBNEWLINE\fR characters, form feeds, and so on) are to be passed through ("non-print"), provided in \fBTELNET\fR format ("\fBTELNET\fR format controls"), or provided in \fBASA\fR (\fBFORTRAN\fR) ("carriage control (\fBASA\fR)") format. \fBftp\fR supports the "network \fBASCII\fR" (subtype "non-print" only) and "image" types, plus "local byte size" with a byte size of 8 for communicating with \fBTENEX\fR machines.
.sp
.LP
The "file structure" can be one of \fBfile\fR (no record structure), \fBrecord\fR, or \fBpage\fR. \fBftp\fR supports only the default value, which is \fBfile\fR.
.sp
.LP
The "transfer mode" can be one of \fBstream\fR, \fBblock\fR, or \fBcompressed\fR. \fBftp\fR supports only the default value, which is \fBstream\fR.

.sp
.LP
An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2 \fBBSD\fR code handling transfers with a "representation type" of "network \fBASCII\fR" has been corrected. This correction can result in incorrect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2 \fBBSD\fR servers using a "representation type" of "network \fBASCII\fR". Avoid this problem by using the "image" type.
