.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In the first synopsis form, the \fBmv\fR utility moves the file named by the \fIsource\fR operand to the destination specified by the \fItarget_file\fR. \fIsource\fR and \fItarget_file\fR can not have the same name. If \fItarget_file\fR does not exist, \fBmv\fR creates a file named \fItarget_file\fR. If \fItarget_file\fR exists, its contents are overwritten. This first synopsis form is assumed when the final operand does not name an existing directory.
.sp
.LP
In the second synopsis form, \fBmv\fR moves each file named by a \fIsource\fR operand to a destination file in the existing directory named by the \fItarget_dir\fR operand. The destination path for each \fIsource\fR is the concatenation of the target directory, a single slash character (\fB/\fR), and the last path name component of the \fIsource\fR. This second form is assumed when the final operand names an existing directory.
.sp
.LP
If \fBmv\fR determines that the mode of \fItarget_file\fR forbids writing, it prints the mode (see \fBchmod\fR(2)), ask for a response, and read the standard input for one line. If the response is affirmative, the \fBmv\fR occurs, if permissible; otherwise, the command exits. Notice that the mode displayed can not fully represent the access permission if \fItarget\fR is associated with an \fBACL\fR. When the parent directory of \fIsource\fR is writable and has the sticky bit set, one or more of the following conditions must be true:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the user must own the file
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
the user must own the directory
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.RE

.el o

.sp
.LP
If \fIsource\fR is a file and \fItarget_file\fR is a link to another file with links, the other links remain and \fItarget_file\fR becomes a new file.
.sp
.LP
If \fIsource\fR and \fItarget_file\fR/\fItarget_dir\fR are on different file systems, \fBmv\fR copies the source and deletes the original. Any hard links to other files are lost. \fBmv\fR attempts to duplicate the source file characteristics to the target, that is, the owner and group id, permission modes, modification and access times, \fBACL\fRs, and extended attributes, if applicable. For symbolic links, \fBmv\fR preserves only the owner and group of the link itself.
.sp
.LP
If unable to preserve owner and group id, \fBmv\fR clears \fBS_ISUID\fR and \fBS_ISGID\fR bits in the target. \fBmv\fR prints a diagnostic message to stderr if unable to clear these bits, though the exit code is not affected. \fBmv\fR might be unable to preserve extended attributes if the target file system does not have extended attribute support. \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/mv\fR prints a diagnostic message to stderr for all other failed attempts to duplicate file characteristics. The exit code is not affected.
.sp
.LP
In order to preserve the source file characteristics, users must have the appropriate file access permissions. This includes being super-user or having the same owner id as the destination file.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
\fBmv\fR moves the file(s) without prompting even if it is writing over an existing \fItarget\fR. Note that this is the default if the standard input is not a terminal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
\fBmv\fR prompts for confirmation whenever the move would overwrite an existing target. This is done regardless of whether the input  is coming from a terminal. If the prompt for confirmation fails, this is equivalent to the user answering in the negative.  An affirmative answer means that the move should proceed. Any other answer prevents \fBmv\fR from overwriting \fItarget\fR.
.RE

.SS "/usr/bin/mv"
.sp
.LP
Specifying both the \fB-f\fR and the \fB-i\fR options is not considered an error. The \fB-f\fR option overrides the \fB-i\fR option.
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/mv"
.sp
.LP
Specifying both the \fB-f\fR and the \fB-i\fR options is not considered an error. The last option specified determines the behavior of \fBmv\fR.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIsource\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A path name of a file or directory to be moved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItarget_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A new path name for the file or directory being moved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fItarget_dir\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A path name of an existing directory into which to move the input files.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBmv\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBmv\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.LP
Affirmative responses are processed using the extended regular expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR keyword in the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category of the user's locale. The locale specified in the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category defines the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the expression defined for \fByesexpr\fR. The locale specified in \fBLC_CTYPE\fR determines the locale for interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data a characters, the behavior of character classes used in the expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR. See \fBlocale\fR(5).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
All input files were moved successfully.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
An error occurred.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
A \fB--\fR permits the user to mark explicitly the end of any command line options, allowing \fBmv\fR to recognize filename arguments that begin with a \fB-\fR. As an aid to BSD migration, \fBmv\fR accepts \fB-\fR as a synonym for \fB--\fR. This migration aid might disappear in a future release.
