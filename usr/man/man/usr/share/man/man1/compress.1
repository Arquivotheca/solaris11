.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "compress"
.sp
.LP
The \fBcompress\fR utility attempts to reduce the size of the named files by using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. Except when the output is to the standard output, each file is replaced by one with the extension \fB\&.Z\fR, while keeping the same ownership modes, change times and modification times, ACLs, and extended attributes. The compress utility also attempt to set the owner and group of \fIfile\fR\fB\&.z\fR to the owner and group of file, but does not fail if this cannot be done. If appending the \fB\&.Z\fR to the file pathname would make the pathname exceed \fB1023\fR bytes, the command fails. If no files are specified, the standard input is compressed to the standard output.
.sp
.LP
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of \fIbits\fR per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50\(mi60%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in \fBpack\fR(1)) and it takes less time to compute. The \fIbits\fR parameter specified during compression is encoded within the compressed file, along with a magic number to ensure that neither decompression of random data nor recompression of compressed data is subsequently allowed.
.SS "uncompress"
.sp
.LP
The \fBuncompress\fR utility restores files to their original state after they have been compressed using the \fBcompress\fR utility. If no files are specified, the standard input is uncompressed to the standard output.
.sp
.LP
This utility supports the uncompressing of any files produced by \fBcompress\fR. For files produced by \fBcompress\fR on other systems, \fBuncompress\fR supports 9- to 16-bit compression (see \fB-b\fR).
.SS "zcat"
.sp
.LP
The \fBzcat\fR utility writes to standard output the uncompressed form of files that have been compressed using \fBcompress\fR. It is the equivalent of \fBuncompress\fR\fB-c\fR. Input files are not affected.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fIbits\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Sets the upper limit (in bits) for common substring codes. \fIbits\fR must be between 9 and 16 (16 is the default). Lowering the number of bits result in larger, less compressed files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Writes to the standard output; no files are changed and no \fB\&.Z\fR files are created. The behavior of \fBzcat\fR is identical to that of `\fBuncompress\fR \fB-c\fR'.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
When compressing, forces compression of \fIfile\fR, even if it does not actually reduce the size of the file, or if the corresponding \fIfile\fR\fB\&.Z\fR file already exists. 
.sp
If the \fB-f\fR option is not specified, and the process is not running in the background, prompts to verify whether an existing file should be overwritten. If the response is affirmative, the existing file is overwritten. When uncompressing, does not prompt for overwriting files. If the \fB-f\fR option is not specified, and the process is not running in the background, prompts to verify whether an existing file should be overwritten. If the standard input is not a terminal and \fB-f\fR is not specified, writes a diagnostic message to standard error and exits with a status greater than \fB0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Verbose. Writes to standard error messages concerning the percentage reduction or expansion of each file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-/\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
When compressing or decompressing, copies any extended system attributes associated with the source file to the target file and copies any extended system attributes associated with extended attributes of the source file to the corresponding extended attributes associated with the target file. If any extended system attributes cannot be copied, the original file is retained, a diagnostic is written to \fBstderr\fR, and the final exit status is \fBnon-zero\fR.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
A path name of a file to be compressed by \fBcompress\fR, uncompressed by \fBuncompress\fR, or whose uncompressed form is written to standard out by \fBzcat\fR. If \fIfile\fR is \fB\(mi\fR, or if no \fIfile\fR is specified, the standard input is used.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBcompress\fR, \fBuncompress\fR, and \fBzcat\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBcompress\fR, \fBuncompress\fR, and \fBzcat\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Affirmative responses are processed using the extended regular expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR keyword in the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category of the user's locale. The locale specified in the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category defines the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the expression defined for \fByesexpr\fR. The locale specified in \fBLC_CTYPE\fR determines the locale for interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data a characters, the behavior of character classes used in the expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR. See \fBlocale\fR(5).
.SH EXIT STATUS

.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Although compressed files are compatible between machines with large memory, \fB-b\fR 12 should be used for file transfer to architectures with a small process data space (64KB or less).
.sp
.LP
\fBcompress\fR should be more flexible about the existence of the \fB\&.\|Z\fR suffix.
