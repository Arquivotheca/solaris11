.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipcs\fR utility prints information about active inter-process communication facilities. The information that is displayed is controlled by the options supplied. Without options, information is printed in short format for message queues, shared memory, and semaphores that are currently active in the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

The next nine characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The first set refers to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions of others in the user-group of the facility entry; and the last to all others. Within each set, the first character indicates permission to read, the second character indicates permission to write or alter the facility entry, and the last character is currently unused.
