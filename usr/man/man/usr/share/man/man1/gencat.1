.TH gencat 1 "1 Feb 1995" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
gencat \- generate a formatted message catalog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBgencat\fR \fIcatfile\fR \fImsgfile\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgencat\fR command merges the message text source file(s) \fImsgfile\fR into a formatted message database \fIcatfile\fR. The database \fIcatfile\fR is created if it does not already exist.  If \fIcatfile\fR does exist, its messages are included in the new \fIcatfile\fR. If set and message numbers collide, the new message-text defined in \fImsgfile\fR replaces the old message text currently contained in \fIcatfile\fR. The message text source file (or set of files) input to \fBgencat\fR can contain either set and message numbers or simply message numbers, in which case the set \fBNL_SETD\fR (see \fBnl_types.h\fR(3HEAD)) is assumed.
.SS "Message Text Source File Format"
.sp
.LP
The format of a message text source file is defined as follows. Note that the fields of a message text source line are separated by a single \fBASCII\fR space or tab character. Any other \fBASCII\fR spaces or tabs are considered as part of the subsequent field.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB$set\fR \fIn comment\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Where \fIn\fR specifies the set identifier of the following messages until the next \fB$set\fR, \fB$delset\fR, or end-of-file appears. \fIn\fR must be a number in the range (\fB1\fR-{\fBNL_SETMAX\fR}). Set identifiers within a single source file need not be contiguous. Any string following the set identifier is treated as a comment.  If no \fB$set\fR directive is specified in a message text source file, all messages are located in the default message set \fBNL_SETD\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB$delset\fR \fIn comment\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
Deletes message set \fIn\fR from an existing message catalog. Any string following the set number is treated as a comment. (\fBNote:\fR if  \fIn\fR is not a valid set it is ignored.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB$\fR\fIcomment\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
A line beginning with a dollar symbol  \fB$\fR followed by an \fBASCII\fR space or tab character is treated as a comment.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIm\fR \fImessage-text\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
The \fIm\fR denotes the message identifier, a number in the range (\fB1\fR-{\fBNL_MSGMAX\fR}).  The \fImessage-text\fR is stored in the message catalog with the set identifier specified by the last \fB$set\fR directive, and with message identifier \fIm\fR. If the \fImessage-text\fR is empty, and an \fBASCII\fR space or tab field separator is present, an empty string is stored in the message catalog.  If a message source line has a message number, but neither a field separator nor \fImessage-text\fR, the existing message with that number (if any) is deleted from the catalog. Message identifiers need not be contiguous.  The length of \fImessage-text\fR must be in the range (\fB0\fR-{\fBNL_TEXTMAX\fR}).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB$quote\fR \fIc\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 22n
.rt  
This line specifies an optional quote character \fIc\fR, which can be used to surround \fImessage-text\fR so that trailing spaces or null (empty) messages are visible in a message source line.  By default, or if an empty \fB$quote\fR directive is supplied, no quoting of \fImessage-text\fR will be recognized.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Empty lines in a message text source file are ignored.
.sp
.LP
Text strings can contain the special characters and escape sequences defined in the following table:
.sp

.sp
.TS
tab() box;
lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) 
lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) 
.
DescriptionSymbolSequence
newlineNL(LF)\en
horizontal tabHT\et
vertical tabVT\ev
backspaceBS\eb
carriage returnCR\er
form feedFF \ef
backslash\e\e\e
bit patternddd\eddd
.TE

.sp
.LP
The escape sequence \fB\e\fR\fIddd\fR consists of backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits, which are taken to specify the value of the desired character. If the character following a backslash is not one of those specified, the backslash is ignored.
.sp
.LP
Backslash followed by an \fBASCII\fR newline character is also used to continue a string on the following line. Thus, the following two lines describe a single message string:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
1 This line continues \e
to the next line
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
which is equivalent to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
    1 This line continues to the next line
.fi
.in -2
