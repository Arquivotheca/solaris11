.SH NAME
tput \- initialize a terminal or query terminfo database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBtput\fR [\fB-T\fR \fItype\fR] \fIcapname\fR [\fIparm\fR]...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBtput\fR \fB-S\fR <<
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtput\fR utility uses the \fBterminfo\fR database to make the values of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to the shell (see \fBsh\fR(1)); to clear, initialize or reset the terminal; or to return the long name of the requested terminal type. \fBtput\fR outputs a string if the capability attribute (\fIcapname\fR) is of type string, or an integer if the attribute is of type integer. If the attribute is of type boolean, \fBtput\fR simply sets the exit status (\fB0\fR for \fBTRUE\fR if the terminal has the capability, \fB1\fR for \fBFALSE\fR if it does not), and produces no output. Before using a value returned on standard output, the user should test the exit status (\fB$?\fR, see \fBsh\fR(1)) to be sure it is \fB0\fR. See the EXIT STATUS section.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR\fItype\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Indicates the \fItype\fR of terminal. Normally this option is unnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment variable \fBTERM\fR. If \fB-T\fR is specified, then the shell variables \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR and the layer size will not be referenced.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-S\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Allows more than one capability per invocation of \fBtput\fR. The capabilities must be passed to \fBtput\fR from the standard input instead of from the command line (see the example in the EXAMPLES section). Only one \fIcapname\fR is allowed per line. The \fB-S\fR option changes the meaning of the \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR boolean and string exit statuses (see the EXAMPLES section).
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcapname\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Indicates the capability attribute from the \fBterminfo\fR database. See \fBterminfo\fR(4) for a complete list of capabilities and the \fIcapname\fR associated with each.
.sp
The following strings will be supported as operands by the implementation in the "C" locale:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBclear\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Display the clear-screen sequence.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBinit\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the user's terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR, above), the following will occur: 
.RS +4
.TP
1.
if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be output (\fBis1\fR, \fBis2\fR, \fBis3\fR, \fBif\fR, \fBiprog\fR),
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
any delays (for instance, newline) specified in the entry will be set in the tty driver,
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to the specification in the entry, and
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be set (every 8 spaces). If an entry does not contain the information needed for any of the four above activities, that activity will silently be skipped.
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBreset\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal's reset strings will be output if present (\fBrs1\fR, \fBrs2\fR, \fBrs3\fR, \fBrf\fR). If the reset strings are not present, but initialization strings are, the initialization strings will be output. Otherwise, \fBreset\fR acts identically to \fBinit\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBlongname\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
If the \fBterminfo\fR database is present and an entry for the user's terminal exists (see \fB-T\fR\fItype\fR above), then the long name of the terminal will be put out. The long name is the last name in the first line of the terminal's description in the \fBterminfo\fR database (see \fBterm\fR(5)).
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIparm\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
If the attribute is a string that takes parameters, the argument \fIparm\fR will be instantiated into the string. An all numeric argument will be passed to the attribute as a number.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRInitializing the terminal according to TERM
.sp
.LP
This example initializes the terminal according to the type of terminal in the environment variable \fBTERM\fR. This command should be included in everyone's .profile after the environment variable \fBTERM\fR has been exported, as illustrated on the \fBprofile\fR(4) manual page.
