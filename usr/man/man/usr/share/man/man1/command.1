.TH command 1 "12 Jul 2011" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
command \- execute a simple command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS "/usr/bin/command"
.LP
.nf
\fBcommand\fR [\fB-p\fR] \fIcommand_name\fR [\fIargument\fR]...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBcommand\fR [\fB-v\fR | \fB-V\fR] \fIcommand_name\fR
.fi

.SS "ksh"
.LP
.nf
\fBcommand\fR [\fB-pvxV\fR] [\fIcommand_name\fR [\fIargument\fR...]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcommand\fR utility causes the shell to treat the arguments as a simple command, suppressing the shell function lookup.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIcommand_name\fR is the same as the name of one of the special built-in utilities, the special properties do not occur. In every other respect, if \fIcommand_name\fR is not the name of a function, the effect of \fBcommand\fR (with no options) are the same as omitting \fBcommand\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcommand\fR utility also provides information concerning how a command name is interpreted by the shell. See \fB-v\fR and \fB-V\fR.
.SS "ksh"
.sp
.LP
Without the \fB-v\fR or \fB-V\fR option, \fBcommand\fR executes \fIcommand_name\fR with arguments specified by \fIargument\fR, suppressing the shell function lookup that normally occurs. In addition, if \fIcommand\fR is a special built-in command, the special properties are removed so that failures do not cause the script that executes it to terminate. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-v\fR or \fB-V\fR options are specified, \fBcommand\fR is equivalent to \fBwhence\fR(1).

If command fails because there are too many arguments, it is invoked multiple times with a subset of the arguments on each invocation. Arguments that occur prior to the first word that expand to multiple arguments and arguments that occur after the last word that expands to multiple arguments are passed on each invocation. The exit status is the maximum invocation exit status.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIargument\fR\fR

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRMaking a Version of \fBcd\fR That Always Prints Out the New Working Directory
.sp
.LP
The following example takes a version of \fBcd\fR that always prints out the new working directory exactly once:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
cd() {
	command cd "$@" >/dev/null
	pwd
}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRStarting Off a \fBsecure shell script\fR in Which the Script Avoids Being Spoofed by Its Parent
.sp
.LP
The following example starts off a \fBsecure shell script\fR in which the script avoids being spoofed by its parent:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
IFS='
\&'
#	The preceding value should be <space><tab><newline>.
#	Set IFS to its default value.
\eunalias -a
#	Unset all possible aliases.
#	Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
#	being used for unalias.
unset -f command
#	Ensure command is not a user function.
PATH="$(command -p getconf _CS_PATH):$PATH"
#	Put on a reliable PATH prefix.
#	...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
At this point, given correct permissions on the directories called by \fBPATH\fR, the script has the ability to ensure that any utility it calls is the intended one. It is being very cautious because it assumes that implementation extensions can be present that would allow user functions to exist when it is invoked. This capability is not specified by this document, but it is not prohibited as an extension. For example, the \fBENV\fR variable precedes the invocation of the script with a user startup script. Such a script could define functions to spoof the application.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
