.SH NAME
rcapstat \- report resource cap enforcement daemon statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrcapstat\fR [\fB-g\fR] [\fB-p | -z\fR] [\fB-T\fR u | d ] [\fIinterval\fR [\fIcount\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrcapstat\fR command reports on the projects or zones capped by \fBrcapd\fR(1M). Each report contains statistics that pertain to the project or zone and paging statistics. Paging refers to the act of relocating portions of memory, called pages, to or from physical memory. \fBrcapd\fR pages out the most infrequently used pages.
.sp
.LP
The paging statistics in the first report issued show the activity since the daemon was started. Subsequent reports reflect the activity since the last report was issued.
.sp
.LP
Reports are issued every \fIinterval\fR seconds up to the quantity specified by \fIcount\fR, or forever if \fIcount\fR is not specified.

The first three lines of output constitute the first report, which contains the cap and project information for the two projects and paging statistics since \fBrcapd\fR was started. The \fBat\fR and \fBpg\fR columns are a number greater than zero for \fBuser1\fR and zero for \fBuser2\fR, which indicates that at some time in the daemon's history, \fBuser1\fR exceeded its cap but \fBuser2\fR did not.

The subsequent reports show no significant activity.

The project \fBuser1\fR has an \fBRSS\fR in excess of its physical memory cap. The nonzero values in the \fBpg\fR column indicate that \fBrcapd\fR is consistently paging out memory as it attempts to meet the cap by lowering the physical memory utilization of the project's processes. However, \fBrcapd\fR is unsuccessful, as indicated by the varying \fBrss\fR values that do not show a corresponding decrease. This means that the application's resident memory is being actively used, forcing \fBrcapd\fR to affect the working set. Under this condition, the system continues to experience high page fault rates, and associated I/O, until the working set size (\fBWSS\fR) is reduced, the cap is raised, or the application changes its memory access pattern. Notice that a page fault occurs when either a new page must be created, or the system must copy in a page from the swap device.

By inhibiting cap enforcement, either by raising the cap of a project or by changing the minimum physical  memory utilization for cap enforcement (see \fBrcapadm\fR(1M)), the resident set can become the working set. The \fBrss\fR column might stabilize to show the project \fBWSS\fR, as shown in the previous example. The \fBWSS\fR is the minimum cap value that allows the project's processes to operate without perpetually incurring page faults.

.SH NOTES

.LP
If the interval specified to \fBrcapstat\fR is shorter than the reporting interval specified to \fBrcapd\fR (with \fBrcapadm\fR(1M)), the output for some intervals can be zero. This is because \fBrcapd\fR does not update statistics more frequently than the interval specified with \fBrcapadm\fR, and this interval is independent of (and less precise than) the sampling interval used by \fBrcapstat\fR.
