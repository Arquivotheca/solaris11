.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sh\fR utility is a standards compliant shell. This utility provides all the functionality of \fB/usr/sunos/bin/ksh\fR, except in cases where differences in behavior exist. See \fBArithmetic Expansions\fR section for details.
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/sunos/bin/ksh\fR is a command and programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file. \fBrksh\fR is a restricted version of the command interpreter \fBksh\fR; it is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the standard shell. See the \fBInvocation\fR section for the meaning of arguments to the shell.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A \fImetacharacter\fR is one of the following characters:
.sp
.LP
\fB; & (   )   |   <   >\fR      \fINEWLINE   SPACE   TAB\fR
.sp
.LP
A \fIblank\fR is a \fITAB\fR or a \fISPACE\fR. An \fIidentifier\fR is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores starting with a letter or underscore. Identifiers are used as names for \fIfunctions\fR and \fIvariables\fR. A \fIword\fR is a sequence of \fIcharacters\fR separated by one or more non-quoted \fImetacharacters\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is a sequence of characters in the syntax of the shell language. The shell reads each command and carries out the desired action either directly or by invoking separate utilities. A \fIspecial-command\fR is a command that is carried out by the shell without creating a separate process. Except for documented side effects, most special commands can be implemented as separate utilities.
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A \fIsimple-command\fR is a sequence of blank-separated words which can be preceded by a variable assignment list. See \fBEnvironment\fR. The first word specifies the name of the command to be executed. Except as specified, the remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0 (see \fBexec\fR(2)). The \fIvalue\fR of a simple-command is its exit status if it terminates normally. If it terminates abnormally due to receipt of a signal, the \fIvalue\fR is the signal number plus 128. See \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD) for a list of signal values. Obviously, normal exit status values 129 to 255 cannot be distinguished from abnormal exit caused by receiving signal numbers 1 to 127.
.sp
.LP
A \fIpipeline\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIcommands\fR separated by \fB|\fR. The standard output of each command but the last is connected by a \fBpipe\fR(2) to the standard input of the next command. Each command is run as a separate process; the shell waits for the last command to terminate. The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command.
.sp
.LP
A \fIlist\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIpipeline\fRs separated by \fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, \fB&&\fR, or \fB|\||\fR, and optionally terminated by \fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, or \fB|&\fR. Of these five symbols, \fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, and \fB|&\fR have equal precedence, which is lower than that of \fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR. The symbols \fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR also have equal precedence. A semicolon (\fB;\fR) causes sequential execution of the preceding pipeline; an ampersand (\fB&\fR) causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline (that is, the shell does \fInot\fR wait for that pipeline to finish). The symbol \fB|&\fR causes asynchronous execution of the preceding command or pipeline with a two-way pipe established to the parent shell.
.sp
.LP
The standard input and output of the spawned command can be written to and read from by the parent shell using the \fB-p\fR option of the special commands \fBread\fR and \fBprint\fR described in \fBSpecial Commands\fR. The symbol \fB&&\fR(\|\fB|\||\fR) causes the \fIlist\fR following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns \fB0\fR (or a non-zero) value. An arbitrary number of new-lines can appear in a \fIlist\fR, instead of a semicolon, to delimit a command.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is either a \fIsimple-command\fR or one of the following. Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last simple-command executed in the command.
.sp
.ne 2

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Each time a \fBfor\fR command is executed, \fIidentifier\fR is set to the next \fIword\fR taken from the \fBin\fR \fIword\fR list. If \fBin\fR \fIword\fR ... is omitted, then the \fBfor\fR command executes the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR once for each positional parameter that is set. See \fBParameter Substitution\fR. Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBselect\fR command prints to standard error (file descriptor 2), the set of \fIword\fRs, each preceded by a number. If \fBin\fR \fIword\fR ... is omitted, then the positional parameters are used instead. See \fBParameter Substitution\fR. The \fBPS3\fR prompt is printed and a line is read from the standard input. If this line consists of the number of one of the listed \fIword\fRs, then the value of the variable \fIidentifier\fR is set to the \fIword\fR corresponding to this number. If this line is empty the selection list is printed again. Otherwise the value of the variable \fIidentifier\fR is set to \fBNULL\fR. (See \fBBlank Interpretation\fR about \fBNULL\fR). The contents of the line read from standard input is saved in the shell variable \fBREPLY\fR. The \fIlist\fR is executed for each selection until a \fBbreak\fR or \fBEOF\fR is encountered. If the \fBREPLY\fR variable is set to \fBNULL\fR by the execution of \fIlist\fR, then the selection list is printed before displaying the \fBPS3\fR prompt for the next selection.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBcase\fR command executes the \fIlist\fR associated with the first \fIpattern\fR that matches \fIword\fR. The form of the patterns is the same as that used for file-name generation. See \fBFile Name Generation\fR.

The \fIlist\fR following \fBif\fR is executed and, if it returns an exit status of \fB0\fR, the \fIlist\fR following the first \fBthen\fR is executed. Otherwise, the \fIlist\fR following \fBelif\fR is executed and, if its value is \fB0\fR, the \fIlist\fR following the next \fBthen\fR is executed. Failing that, the \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR is executed. If no \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR or \fBthen\fR \fIlist\fR is executed, then the \fBif\fR command returns \fB0\fR exit status.

A \fBwhile\fR command repeatedly executes the \fBwhile\fR \fIlist\fR and, if the exit status of the last command in the list is \fB0\fR, executes the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR; otherwise the loop terminates. If no commands in the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR are executed, then the \fBwhile\fR command returns \fB0\fR exit status. \fBuntil\fR can be used in place of \fBwhile\fR to negate the loop termination test.

The following reserved words are only recognized as the first word of a command and when not quoted:

function   select   time     [[  ]]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Comments"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with \fB#\fR causes that word and all the following characters up to a new-line to be ignored.
.SS "Aliasing"
.sp
.LP
The first word of each command is replaced by the text of an alias if an alias for this word has been defined. An alias name consists of any number of characters excluding metacharacters, quoting characters, file expansion characters, parameter and command substitution characters, and \fB=\fR. The replacement string can contain any valid shell script including the metacharacters listed above. The first word of each command in the replaced text, other than any that are in the process of being replaced, is tested for aliases. If the last character of the alias value is a \fIblank\fR then the word following the alias is also be checked for alias substitution. Aliases can be used to redefine special builtin commands but cannot be used to redefine the reserved words listed above. Aliases can be created, listed, and exported with the \fBalias\fR command and can be removed with the \fBunalias\fR command. Exported aliases remain in effect for scripts invoked by name, but must be reinitialized for separate invocations of the shell. See \fBInvocation\fR. To prevent infinite loops in recursive aliasing, if the shell is not currently processing an alias of the same name, the word is replaced by the value of the alias; otherwise, it is not be replaced.
.sp
.LP
Aliasing is performed when scripts are read, not while they are executed. Therefore, for an alias to take effect, the \fBalias\fR definition command has to be executed before the command which references the alias is read.
.sp
.LP
Aliases are frequently used as a short hand for full path names. An option to the aliasing facility allows the value of the alias to be automatically set to the full pathname of the corresponding command. These aliases are called \fItracked\fR aliases. The value of a \fItracked\fR alias is defined the first time the corresponding command is looked up and becomes undefined each time the \fBPATH\fR variable is reset. These aliases remain \fItracked\fR so that the next subsequent reference redefines the value. Several tracked aliases are compiled into the shell. The \fB-h\fR option of the \fBset\fR command makes each referenced command name into a tracked alias.
.sp
.LP
The following \fIexported aliases\fR are compiled into (and built-in to) the shell but can be unset or redefined:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBautoload='typeset \(mifu'
functions='typeset \(mif'
history='fc \(mil'
integer='typeset \(mii'
nohup='nohup '
r='fc \(mie \(mi'\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
An example concerning trailing blank characters and reserved words follows. If the user types: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBalias foo="/bin/ls "\fR
$ \fBalias while="/"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
the effect of executing:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBwhile true\fR
> \fBdo\fR
> \fBecho "Hello, World"\fR
> \fBdone\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
is a never-ending sequence of \fBHello, World\fR strings to the screen. However, if the user types:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBfoo while\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
the result is an \fBls\fR listing of \fB/\fR. Since the alias substitution for \fBfoo\fR ends in a space character, the next word is checked for alias substitution. The next word, \fBwhile\fR, has also been aliased, so it is substituted as well. Since it is not in the proper position as a command word, it is not recognized as a reserved word.
.sp
.LP
If the user types:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBfoo; while\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fBwhile\fR retains its normal reserved-word properties.
.SS "Tilde Substitution"
.sp
.LP
After alias substitution is performed, each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted \fB~\fR. If it does, then the word up to a \fB/\fR is checked to see if it matches a user name. If a match is found, the \fB~\fR and the matched login name are replaced by the login directory of the matched user. This is called a \fItilde\fR substitution. If no match is found, the original text is left unchanged. A \fB~\fR by itself, or in front of a \fB/\fR, is replaced by \fB$HOME\fR. A \fB~\fR followed by a \fB+\fR or \fB\(mi\fR is replaced by \fB$PWD\fR and \fB$OLDPWD\fR, respectively.
.sp
.LP
In addition, \fItilde\fR substitution is attempted when the value of a \fIvariable assignment\fR begins with a \fB~\fR.
.SS "Tilde Expansion"
.sp
.LP
A \fItilde-prefix\fR consists of an unquoted tilde character at the beginning of a word, followed by all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash in the word, or all the characters in the word if there is no slash. In an assignment, multiple tilde-prefixes can be used: at the beginning of the word (that is, following the equal sign of the assignment), following any unquoted colon or both. A tilde-prefix in an assignment is terminated by the first unquoted colon or slash. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name from the user database.
.sp
.LP
A portable login name cannot contain characters outside the set given in the description of the \fBLOGNAME\fR environment variable. If the login name is null (that is, the tilde-prefix contains only the tilde), the tilde-prefix is replaced by the value of the variable \fBHOME\fR. If \fBHOME\fR is unset, the results are unspecified. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced by a pathname of the home directory associated with the login name obtained using the \fBgetpwnam\fR function. If the system does not recognize the login name, the results are undefined.
.sp
.LP
Tilde expansion generally occurs only at the beginning of words, but an exception based on historical practice has been included:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
PATH=/posix/bin:~dgk/bin
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
is eligible for tilde expansion because tilde follows a colon and none of the relevant characters is quoted. Consideration was given to prohibiting this behavior because any of the following are reasonable substitutes:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
PATH=$(printf %s ~karels/bin : ~bostic/bin)
for Dir in ~maart/bin ~srb/bin .
do
     PATH=${PATH:+$PATH:}$Dir
done
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
With the first command, explicit colons are used for each directory. In all cases, the shell performs tilde expansion on each directory because all are separate words to the shell.
.sp
.LP
Expressions in operands such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
make -k mumble LIBDIR=~chet/lib
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
do not qualify as shell variable assignments and tilde expansion is not performed (unless the command does so itself, which \fBmake\fR does not).
.sp
.LP
The special sequence \fB$~\fR has been designated for future implementations to evaluate as a means of forcing tilde expansion in any word.
.sp
.LP
Because of the requirement that the word not be quoted, the following are not equivalent; only the last causes tilde expansion:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB\e~hlj/   ~h\elj/   ~"hlj"/   ~hlj\e/   ~hlj/\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The results of giving tilde with an unknown login name are undefined because the KornShell \fB~+\fR and \fB~\(mi\fR constructs make use of this condition, but, in general it is an error to give an incorrect login name with tilde. The results of having \fBHOME\fR unset are unspecified because some historical shells treat this as an error.
.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The standard output from a \fIcommand\fR enclosed in parenthesis preceded by a dollar sign (that is, \fB$(\fR\fIcommand\fR\fB)\fR) or a pair of grave accents (\fB``\fR) can be used as part or all of a word. Trailing new-lines are removed. In the second (archaic) form, the string between the quotes is processed for special quoting characters before the command is executed. See \fBQuoting\fR. The command substitution \fB$(cat\fR \fIfile\fR\fB)\fR can be replaced by the equivalent but faster \fB$(<\fR\fIfile\fR\fB)\fR. Command substitution of most special commands that do not perform input/output redirection are carried out without creating a separate process.
.sp
.LP
Command substitution allows the output of a command to be substituted in place of the command name itself. Command substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$(\fIcommand\fR)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
or (backquoted version):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
`\fIcommand\fR\fB`\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The shell expands the command substitution by executing \fIcommand\fR in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution (the text of \fIcommand\fR plus the enclosing \fB$()\fR or backquotes) with the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or more newline characters at the end of the substitution. Embedded newline characters before the end of the output is not be removed; however, they can be treated as field delimiters and eliminated during field splitting, depending on the value of \fBIFS\fR and quoting that is in effect.
.sp
.LP
Within the backquoted style of command substitution, backslash shall retain its literal meaning, except when followed by:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB$     `     \e\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
(dollar-sign, backquote, backslash). The search for the matching backquote is satisfied by the first backquote found without a preceding backslash. During this search, if a non-escaped backquote is encountered within a shell comment, a here-document, an embedded command substitution of the $(\fIcommand\fR) form, or a quoted string, undefined results occur. A single- or double-quoted string that begins, but does not end, within the `\fB\&...\fR` sequence produces undefined results.
.sp
.LP
With the $(\fIcommand\fR) form, all characters following the open parenthesis to the matching closing parenthesis constitute the \fIcommand\fR. Any valid shell script can be used for \fIcommand\fR, except:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A script consisting solely of redirections produces unspecified results.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
See the restriction on single subshells.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The results of command substitution are not field splitting and pathname expansion processed for further tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution or arithmetic expansion. If a command substitution occurs inside double-quotes, it is not be performed on the results of the substitution.
.sp
.LP
Command substitution can be nested. To specify nesting within the backquoted version, the application must precede the inner backquotes with backslashes; for example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
`\e`\fIcommand\fR\fB\e``\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB$()\fR form of command substitution solves a problem of inconsistent behavior when using backquotes. For example:
.sp

.sp
.TS
tab() box;
cw(2.75i) cw(2.75i) 
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) 
.
CommandOutput
_
echo '\e$x'\e$x
echo `echo '\e$x'`$x
echo $(echo '\e$x')\e$x
.TE

.sp
.LP
Additionally, the backquoted syntax has historical restrictions on the contents of the embedded command. While the new \fB$()\fR form can process any kind of valid embedded script, the backquoted form cannot handle some valid scripts that include backquotes. For example, these otherwise valid embedded scripts do not work in the left column, but do work on the right:
.sp

.sp
.TS
tab() box;
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) 
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) 
.
echo `echo $(
cat <<eeofcat <<eeof
a here-doc with `a here-doc with )
eofeof
`)
echo `echo $(
echo abc # a comment with `echo abc # a comment with )
`)
echo `echo $(
echo '`'echo ')'
`)
.TE

.sp
.LP
Because of these inconsistent behaviors, the backquoted variety of command substitution is not recommended for new applications that nest command substitutions or attempt to embed complex scripts.
.sp
.LP
If the command substitution consists of a single subshell, such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$( (\fIcommand\fR) )
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
a portable application must separate the \fB$(\fR and \fB(\fR into two tokens (that is, separate them with white space). This is required to avoid any ambiguities with arithmetic expansion.
.SS "Arithmetic Expansion"
.sp
.LP
An arithmetic expression enclosed in double parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ( \fB$((\fR\fIarithmetic-expression\fR\fB))\fR ) is replaced by the value of the arithmetic expression within the double parenthesis. Arithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an arithmetic expression and substituting its value. The format for arithmetic expansion is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$((\fIexpression\fR))
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated specially. The shell expands all tokens in the expression for parameter expansion, command substitution and quote removal.
.sp
.LP
Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and substitute the value of the expression. The arithmetic expression is processed according to the rules of the ISO C with the following exceptions:

.SS "Process Substitution"
.sp
.LP
This feature is available in SunOS and only on versions of the UNIX operating system that support the \fB/dev/fd\fR directory for naming open files. Each command argument of the form \fB<(\fR\fIlist\fR\fB)\fR or \fB>(\fR\fIlist\fR\fB)\fR runs process \fIlist\fR asynchronously connected to some file in \fB/dev/fd\fR. The name of this file becomes the argument to the command. If the form with \fB>\fR is selected, then writing on this file provides input for \fIlist\fR. If \fB<\fR is used, then the file passed as an argument contains the output of the \fIlist\fR process. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
paste <(cut -f1 \fIfile1\fR) <(cut -f3 \fIfile2\fR) | tee >(\fIprocess1\fR) >(\fIprocess2\fR)

The file, which is passed as an argument to the command, is a UNIX \fBpipe\fR(2) so programs that expect to \fBlseek\fR(2) on the file does not work.
.SS "Parameter Substitution"
.sp
.LP
A \fIparameter\fR is an \fIidentifier\fR, one or more digits, or any of the characters \fB*\fR, \fB@\fR, \fB#\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB\(mi\fR, \fB$\fR, and \fB!\fR. A \fIvariable\fR (a \fIparameter\fR denoted by an \fIidentifier\fR) has a \fIvalue\fR and zero or more \fIattributes\fR. \fIvariable\fRs can be assigned \fIvalue\fRs and \fIattribute\fRs by using the \fBtypeset\fR special command. The attributes supported by the shell are described later with the \fBtypeset\fR special command. Exported variables pass values and attributes to the environment.
.sp
.LP
The shell supports a one-dimensional array facility. An element of an array variable is referenced by a \fIsubscript\fR. A \fIsubscript\fR is denoted by a \fB[\fR, followed by an \fIarithmetic expression\fR, followed by a \fB]\fR. See \fBArithmetic Evaluation\fR. To assign values to an array, use \fBset\fR \fB-A\fR \fIname value\fR \fB\&...\fR. The \fIvalue\fR of all subscripts must be in the range of 0 through 4095. Arrays need not be declared. Any reference to a variable with a valid subscript is legal and an array is created if necessary. Referencing an array without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the element \fB0\fR. If an array \fIidentifier\fR with subscript \fB*\fR or \fB@\fR is used, then the value for each of the elements is substituted (separated by a field separator character).
.sp
.LP
The \fIvalue\fR of a \fIvariable\fR can be assigned by writing:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR [ \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR ] ...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If the integer attribute, \fB-i\fR, is set for \fIname\fR, the \fIvalue\fR is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
.sp
.LP
Positional parameters, parameters denoted by a number, can be assigned values with the \fBset\fR special command. Parameter \fB$0\fR is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked. If \fIparameter\fR is one or more digits then it is a positional parameter. A positional parameter of more than one digit must be enclosed in braces.
.SS "Parameter Expansion"
.sp
.LP
The format for parameter expansion is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
${\fIexpression\fR}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIexpression\fR consists of all characters until the matching \fB}\fR. Any \fB}\fR escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command substitutions and variable expansions, are not examined in determining the matching \fB}\fR.
.sp
.LP
The simplest form for parameter expansion is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
${\fIparameter\fR}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The value, if any, of \fIparameter\fR is substituted.
.sp
.LP
The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are optional except for positional parameters with more than one digit or when \fIparameter\fR is followed by a character that could be interpreted as part of the name. The matching closing brace are determined by counting brace levels, skipping over enclosed quoted strings and command substitutions.
.sp
.LP
If the parameter name or symbol is not enclosed in braces, the expansion uses the longest valid name whether or not the symbol represented by that name exists. When the shell is scanning its input to determine the boundaries of a name, it is not bound by its knowledge of what names are already defined. For example, if \fBF\fR is a defined shell variable, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBecho $Fred\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
does not echo the value of \fB$F\fR followed by \fBred\fR; it selects the longest possible valid name, \fBFred\fR, which in this case might be unset.
.sp

In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of the following formats. In each case that a value of \fIword\fR is needed (based on the state of \fIparameter\fR), \fIword\fR is subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion. If \fIword\fR is not needed, it is not expanded. The \fB}\fR character that delimits the following parameter expansion modifications is determined as described previously in this section and in \fBdquote\fR. (For example, \fB${foo-bar}xyz}\fR would result in the expansion of \fBfoo\fR followed by the string \fBxyz}\fR if \fBfoo\fR is set, else the string \fBbarxyz}\fR).

The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for substring processing.

.SS "Blank Interpretation"

After parameter and command substitution, the results of substitutions are scanned for the field separator characters (those found in \fBIFS\fR) and split into distinct arguments where such characters are found. Explicit null arguments ( \fB""\fR ) or (\fB\&''\fR) are retained. Implicit null arguments (those resulting from \fIparameters\fR that have no values) are removed.
.SS "File Name Generation"
.sp
.LP
Following substitution, each command \fIword\fR is scanned for the characters \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR, and \fB[\fR unless the \fB-f\fR option has been \fBset\fR. If one of these characters appears, the word is regarded as a \fIpattern\fR. The word is replaced with lexicographically sorted file names that match the pattern. If no file name is found that matches the pattern, the word is left unchanged. When a \fIpattern\fR is used for file name generation, the character period (\fB\&.\fR) at the start of a file name or immediately following a \fB/\fR, as well as the character \fB/\fR itself, must be matched explicitly. A file name beginning with a period is not matched with a pattern with the period inside parentheses. That is, \fBls .@(r*)\fR would locate a file named \fB\&.restore\fR, but \fBls @(.r*)\fR would not. In other instances of pattern matching, the \fB/\fR and \fB\&.\fR are not treated specially.

.SS "Quoting"
.sp
.LP
Each of the \fImetacharacters\fR listed above (see \fBDefinitions\fR) has a special meaning to the shell and causes termination of a word unless quoted. A character can be \fIquoted\fR (that is, made to stand for itself) by preceding it with a \fB\e\|\fR\&. The pair \fB\e\|NEWLINE\fR is removed. All characters enclosed between a pair of single quote marks (\fB\&' '\fR) are quoted. A single quote cannot appear within single quotes. Inside double quote marks (\fB""\fR), parameter and command substitution occur and \fB\e\fR quotes the characters \fB\e\|\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB"\fR, and \fB$\fR. The meaning of \fB$*\fR and \fB$@\fR is identical when not quoted or when used as a parameter assignment value or as a file name. However, when used as a command argument, \fB$*\fR is equivalent to \fB``$1\fR\fId\fR\fB\|$2\fR\fId\fR\fB\&...'',\fR where \fId\fR is the first character of the \fBIFS\fR variable, whereas \fB$@\fR is equivalent to \fB$1\fR \fB$2\fR .\|.\|.. Inside grave quote marks (\fB``\fR), \fB\e\fR quotes the characters \fB\e\fR, \fB\&'\fR, and \fB$\fR. If the grave quotes occur within double quotes, then \fB\e\fR also quotes the character \fB"\fR.
.sp

The special meaning of reserved words or aliases can be removed by quoting any character of the reserved word. The recognition of function names or special command names listed cannot be altered by quoting them.
.SS "Arithmetic Evaluation"
.sp
.LP
An ability to perform integer arithmetic is provided with the special command \fBlet\fR. Evaluations are performed using \fIlong\fR arithmetic. Constants are of the form [ \fIbase\fR\fB#\fR ] \fIn\fR where \fIbase\fR is a decimal number between two and thirty-six representing the arithmetic base and \fIn\fR is a number in that base. If \fIbase\fR is omitted then base 10 is used.
.sp
.LP
An arithmetic expression uses the same syntax, precedence, and associativity of expression as the C language. All the integral operators, other than \fB++\fR, \fB-;\fR, \fB?:\fR, and \fB,\fR are supported. Variables can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression without using the parameter substitution syntax. When a variable is referenced, its value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.
.sp
.LP
An internal integer representation of a \fIvariable\fR can be specified with the \fB-i\fR option of the \fBtypeset\fR special command. Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each assignment to a variable with the \fB-i\fR attribute. If you do not specify an arithmetic base, the first assignment to the variable determines the arithmetic base. This base is used when parameter substitution occurs.
.sp
.LP
Since many of the arithmetic operators require quoting, an alternative form of the \fBlet\fR command is provided. For any command which begins with a \fB((\fR, all the characters until a matching \fB))\fR are treated as a quoted expression. More precisely, \fB((\fR.\|.\|.\fB))\fR is equivalent to \fBlet\fR \fB"\fR\|.\|.\|.\fB"\fR.
.SS "Prompting"
.sp
.LP
When used interactively, the shell prompts with the parameter expanded value of \fBPS1\fR before reading a command. If at any time a new-line is typed and further input is needed to complete a command, then the secondary prompt (that is, the value of \fBPS2\fR) is issued.
.SS "Conditional Expressions"

If \fB\(mi\fR is appended to \fB<<\fR, then all leading tabs are stripped from \fIword\fR and from the document.

If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file descriptor number referred to is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1). For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&... 2>&1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
means file descriptor 2 is to be opened for writing as a duplicate of file descriptor 1.
.sp
.LP
The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the (\fIfile descriptor\fR, \fIfile\fR) association at the time of evaluation. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&... 1>\fIfname\fR 2>&1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file \fIfname\fR. It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is, \fIfname\fR). If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file \fIfname\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a command is followed by \fB&\fR and job control is not active, then the default standard input for the command is the empty file \fB/dev/null\fR. Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The \fIenvironment\fR (see \fBenviron\fR(5)) is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument list. The names must be \fIidentifiers\fR and the values are character strings. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a variable for each name found, giving it the corresponding value and marking it \fIexport\fR. Executed commands inherit the environment. If the user modifies the values of these variables or creates new ones, using the \fBexport\fR or \fBtypeset\fR \fB-x\fR commands, they become part of the environment. The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, whose values can be modified by the current shell, plus any additions which must be noted in \fBexport\fR or \fBtypeset\fR \fB-x\fR commands.
.sp
.LP
The environment for any \fIsimple-command\fR or \fIfunction\fR can be augmented by prefixing it with one or more variable assignments. A variable assignment argument is a word of the form \fIidentifier=value\fR. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBTERM=450 \fIcmd args\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB(export TERM; TERM=450; \fIcmd args)\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
are equivalent (as far as the above execution of \fIcmd\fR is concerned, except for special commands listed that are preceded with an asterisk).
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-k\fR flag is set, \fIall\fR variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment, even if they occur after the command name. The following first prints \fBa=b c\fR and then \fBc\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
echo a=b c
set \(mik echo
a=b c 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This feature is intended for use with scripts written for early versions of the shell and its use in new scripts is strongly discouraged. It is likely to disappear someday.
.SS "Functions"
.sp
.LP
The \fBfunction\fR reserved word, described in the \fBCommands\fR section above, is used to define shell functions. Shell functions are read in and stored internally. Alias names are resolved when the function is read. Functions are executed like commands with the arguments passed as positional parameters. See \fBExecution\fR.
.sp
.LP
Functions execute in the same process as the caller and share all files and present working directory with the caller. Traps caught by the caller are reset to their default action inside the function. A trap condition that is not caught or ignored by the function causes the function to terminate and the condition to be passed on to the caller.
.sp
.LP
A trap on \fBEXIT\fR set inside a function is executed after the function completes in the environment of the caller. This is true only for non-POSIX-style functions, that is, functions declared as
.sp
.in +2
.nf
function func
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
as opposed to POSIX-style functions, declared as
.sp
.in +2
.nf
func()
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Ordinarily, variables are shared between the calling program and the function. However, the \fBtypeset\fR special command used within a function defines local variables whose scope includes the current function and all functions it calls.
.sp
.LP
The special command \fBreturn\fR is used to return from function calls. Errors within functions return control to the caller.
.sp
.LP
The names of all functions can be listed with \fBtypeset\fR\fB-f\fR. \fBtypeset\fR \fB-f\fR lists all function names as well as the text of all functions. \fBtypeset\fR \fB-f\fR \fIfunction-names\fR lists the text of the named functions only. Functions can be undefined with the \fB-f\fR option of the \fBunset\fR special command.
.sp
.LP
Ordinarily, functions are \fBunset\fR when the shell executes a shell script. The \fB-xf\fR option of the \fBtypeset\fR command allows a function to be exported to scripts that are executed without a separate invocation of the shell. Functions that need to be defined across separate invocations of the shell should be specified in the \fBENV\fR file with the \fB-xf\fR option of \fBtypeset\fR.
.SS "Function Definition Command"
.sp
.LP
A function is a user-defined name that is used as a simple command to call a compound command with new positional parameters. A function is defined with a \fIfunction definition command\fR.
.sp
.LP
The format of a function definition command is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBfname()\fR \fIcompound-command\fR[\fIio-redirect\fR ...]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The function is named \fBfname\fR; it must be a name. An implementation can allow other characters in a function name as an extension. The implementation maintains separate name spaces for functions and variables.
.sp
.LP
The \fB()\fR in the function definition command consists of two operators. Therefore, intermixing blank characters with the \fBfname\fR, \fB(\fR, and \fB)\fR is allowed, but unnecessary.
.sp
.LP
The argument \fIcompound-command\fR represents a compound command.
.sp
.LP
When the function is declared, none of the expansions in \fBwordexp\fR is performed on the text in \fIcompound-command\fR or \fIio-redirect\fR; all expansions is performed as normal each time the function is called. Similarly, the optional \fIio-redirect\fR redirections and any variable assignments within \fIcompound-command\fR is performed during the execution of the function itself, not the function definition.
.sp
.LP
When a function is executed, it has the syntax-error and variable-assignment properties described for the special built-in utilities.
.sp
.LP
The \fIcompound-command\fR is executed whenever the function name is specified as the name of a simple command The operands to the command temporarily becomes the positional parameters during the execution of the \fIcompound-command\fR; the special parameter \fB#\fR is also changed to reflect the number of operands. The special parameter \fB0\fR is unchanged. When the function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter \fB#\fR is restored to the values they had before the function was executed. If the special built-in \fBreturn\fR is executed in the \fIcompound-command\fR, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call.
.sp
.LP
An example of how a function definition can be used wherever a simple command is allowed:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# If variable i is equal to "yes",
# define function foo to be ls \(mil
#
[ "$i" = yes ] && foo() {
      ls \(mil
}\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The exit status of a function definition is \fB0\fR if the function was declared successfully; otherwise, it is greater than zero. The exit status of a function invocation is the exit status of the last command executed by the function.
.SS "Jobs"
.sp
.LP
If the \fBmonitor\fR option of the \fBset\fR command is turned on, an interactive shell associates a \fBjob\fR with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the \fBjobs\fR command, and assigns them small integer numbers. When a job is started asynchronously with \fB&\fR, the shell prints a line which looks like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[1] 1234
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
indicating that the \fBjob\fR, which was started asynchronously, was job number \fB1\fR and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was \fB1234\fR.
.sp
.LP
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you can press the key \fB^Z\fR (Control-Z) which sends a \fBSTOP\fR signal to the current job. The shell normally indicates that the job has been \fB`Stopped'\fR, and print another prompt. You can then manipulate the state of this job, putting it in the background with the \fBbg\fR command, or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with the foreground command \fBfg\fR. A \fB^Z\fR takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.
.sp
.LP
A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command \fB"stty tostop"\fR\&. If you set this tty option, then background jobs stop when they try to produce output as they do when they try to read input.
.sp
.LP
There are several ways to refer to \fBjob\fRs in the shell. A \fBjob\fR can be referred to by the process id of any process of the \fBjob\fR or by one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.LP
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state. It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints a prompt. This is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work.
.sp
.LP
When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes triggers any trap set for \fBCHLD\fR.
.sp
.LP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or stopped, you are warned with the message, \fB`You have stopped(running) jobs.'\fR You can use the \fBjobs\fR command to see what they are. If you do this or immediately try to exit again, the shell does not warn you a second time, and the stopped jobs is terminated. If you have jobs running for which the \fBnohup\fR command was invoked and attempt to logout, you are warned with the message:
.sp
.LP
\fBYou have jobs running.\fR 
.sp
.LP
You need to logout a second time to actually logout. However, your background jobs continue to run.
.SS "Signals"
.sp
.LP
The \fBINT\fR and \fBQUIT\fR signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by \fB&\fR and the \fB-monitor\fR option is not active. Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its parent. See the \fBtrap\fR special command section.
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is executed, the above substitutions are carried out. If the command name matches one of the \fBSpecial Commands\fR listed, it is executed within the current shell process. Next, the command name is checked to see if it matches one of the user defined functions. If it does, the positional parameters are saved and then reset to the arguments of the \fBfunction\fR call. When the \fBfunction\fR completes or issues a \fBreturn\fR, the positional parameter list is restored and any trap set on \fBEXIT\fR within the function is executed. The value of a \fBfunction\fR is the value of the last command executed. A function is also executed in the current shell process. If a command name is not a \fBspecial command\fR or a user defined \fBfunction\fR, a process is created and an attempt is made to execute the command using \fBexec\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The shell variable \fBPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fB/bin:/usr/bin:\fR (specifying \fB/bin\fR, \fB/usr/bin\fR, and the current directory in that order). The current directory can be specified by two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at the beginning or end of the path list. If the command name contains a \fB/\fR then the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an executable file. If the file has execute permission but is not a directory or an \fBa.out\fR file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A sub-shell is spawned to read it. All non-exported aliases, functions, and variables are removed in this case. A parenthesized command is executed in a sub-shell without removing non-exported quantities.
.SS "Command Re-entry"
.sp
.LP
The text of the last \fBHISTSIZE\fR (default 128) commands entered from a terminal device is saved in a \fBhistory\fR file. The file \fB$HOME/.sh_history\fR is used if the \fBHISTFILE\fR variable is not set or if the file it names is not writable. A shell can access the commands of all \fIinteractive\fR shells which use the same named \fBHISTFILE\fR. The special command \fBfc\fR is used to list or edit a portion of this file. The portion of the file to be edited or listed can be selected by number or by giving the first character or characters of the command. A single command or range of commands can be specified. If you do not specify an editor program as an argument to \fBfc\fR then the value of the variable \fBFCEDIT\fR is used. If \fBFCEDIT\fR is not defined, then \fB/bin/ed\fR is used. The edited command(s) is printed and re-executed upon leaving the editor. The editor name \fB\(mi\fR is used to skip the editing phase and to re-execute the command. In this case a substitution parameter of the form \fIold\fR\fB=\fR\fInew\fR can be used to modify the command before execution.  For example, if \fBr\fR is aliased to \fB\&'fc\fR \fB-e\fR \fB\fR\fB-\fR\fB\&'\fR then typing \fB\&'r bad=good c'\fR re-executes the most recent command which starts with the letter \fBc\fR, replacing the first occurrence of the string \fBbad\fR with the string \fBgood\fR.
.SS "In-line Editing Option"
.sp
.LP
Normally, each command line entered from a terminal device is simply typed followed by a new-line (RETURN or LINEFEED). If either the \fBemacs\fR, \fBgmacs\fR, or \fBvi\fR option is active, the user can edit the command line. To be in either of these edit modes \fBset\fR the corresponding option. An editing option is automatically selected each time the \fBVISUAL\fR or \fBEDITOR\fR variable is assigned a value ending in either of these option names.
.sp
.LP
The editing features require that the user's terminal accept \fBRETURN\fR as carriage return without line feed and that a space must overwrite the current character on the screen.
.sp
.LP
The editing modes implement a concept where the user is looking through a window at the current line. The window width is the value of \fBCOLUMNS\fR if it is defined, otherwise 80. If the window width is too small to display the prompt and leave at least 8 columns to enter input, the prompt is truncated from the left. If the line is longer than the window width minus two, a mark is displayed at the end of the window to notify the user. As the cursor moves and reaches the window boundaries the window are centered about the cursor. The mark is a \fB>\fR if the line extends on the right side of the window, \fB<\fR if the line extends on the left, and \fB*\fR if the line extends on both sides of the window.
.sp
.LP
The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the history file. Only strings are matched, not patterns, although a leading caret (\fB^\fR) in the string restricts the match to begin at the first character in the line.
.SS "emacs Editing Mode"
.sp
.LP
This mode is entered by enabling either the \fBemacs\fR or \fBgmacs\fR option. The only difference between these two modes is the way they handle \fB^T\fR. To edit, move the cursor to the point needing correction and then insert or delete characters or words as needed. All the editing commands are control characters or escape sequences. The notation for control characters is caret ( \fB^\fR ) followed by the character. For example, \fB^F\fR is the notation for control \fBF\fR. This is entered by depressing `f' while holding down the CTRL (control) key. The SHIFT key is \fInot\fR depressed. (The notation \fB^?\fR indicates the DEL (delete) key.)
.sp
.LP
The notation for escape sequences is \fBM-\fR followed by a character. For example, \fBM-f\fR (pronounced Meta f) is entered by depressing ESC (ascii \fB033\fR) followed by `f'. (\fBM-F\fR would be the notation for ESC followed by SHIFT (capital) `F'.)
.sp

All edit commands operate from any place on the line (not just at the beginning). Neither the RETURN nor the LINEFEED key is entered after edit commands except when noted.

.SS "vi Editing Mode"
.sp
.LP
There are two typing modes. Initially, when you enter a command you are in the \fIinput\fR mode. To edit, enter \fIcontrol\fR mode by typing \fBESC\fR (\fB033\fR) and move the cursor to the point needing correction and then insert or delete characters or words as needed. Most control commands accept an optional repeat \fIcount\fR prior to the command.
.sp
.LP
When in \fBvi\fR mode on most systems, canonical processing is initially enabled and the command is echoed again if the speed is 1200 baud or greater and it contains any control characters or less than one second has elapsed since the prompt was printed. The ESC character terminates canonical processing for the remainder of the command and the user can then modify the command line. This scheme has the advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead echoing of raw mode.
.sp
.LP
If the option \fBviraw\fR is also set, the terminal always have canonical processing disabled. This mode is implicit for systems that do not support two alternate end of line delimiters, and can be helpful for certain terminals.

This command can be in either of two forms. In the first form it changes the current directory to \fIarg\fR. If \fIarg\fR is \fB\(mi\fR the directory is changed to the previous directory. The shell variable \fBHOME\fR is the default \fIarg\fR. The environment variable \fBPWD\fR is set to the current directory. If the \fBPWD\fR is changed, the \fBOLDPWD\fR environment variable shall also be changed to the value of the old working directory, that is, the current working directory immediately prior to the call to change directory (\fBcd\fR). The shell variable \fBCDPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing \fIarg\fR. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is null (specifying the current directory). The current directory is specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If \fIarg\fR begins with a \fB/\fR then the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for \fIarg\fR. If unsuccessful, \fBcd\fR attempts to change directories to the pathname formed by the concatenation of the value of PWD, a slash character, and arg.

In the first form, a range of commands from \fIfirst\fR to \fIlast\fR is selected from the last \fBHISTSIZE\fR commands that were typed at the terminal. The arguments \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR can be specified as a number or as a string. A string is used to locate the most recent command starting with the given string. A negative number is used as an offset to the current command number. If the \fB-l\fR flag is selected, the commands are listed on standard output. Otherwise, the editor program \fIename\fR is invoked on a file containing these keyboard commands. If \fIename\fR is not supplied, then the value of the variable \fBFCEDIT\fR (default \fB/bin/ed\fR) is used as the editor. When editing is complete, the edited command(s) is executed.

Checks \fIarg\fR for legal options. If \fIarg\fR is omitted, the positional parameters are used. An option argument begins with a \fB+\fR or a \fB\(mi\fR\&. An option not beginning with \fB+\fR or \fB\(mi\fR or the argument \fB-\fR ends the options. \fIoptstring\fR contains the letters that \fBgetopts\fR recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a \fB:\fR, that option is expected to have an argument. The options can be separated from the argument by blanks.
.sp
\fBgetopts\fR places the next option letter it finds inside variable \fIname\fR each time it is invoked with a \fB+\fR prepended when \fIarg\fR begins with a \fB+\fR. The index of the next \fIarg\fR is stored in \fBOPTIND\fR. The option argument, if any, gets stored in \fBOPTARG\fR.
.sp
A leading \fB:\fR in \fIoptstring\fR causes \fBgetopts\fR to store the letter of an invalid option in \fBOPTARG\fR, and to set \fIname\fR to \fB?\fR for an unknown option and to \fB:\fR when a required option is missing. Otherwise, \fBgetopts\fR prints an error message. The exit status is non-zero when there are no more options. See \fBgetoptcvt\fR(1) for usage and description.
.sp
\fBgetopts\fR supports both traditional single-character short options and long options defined by Sun's Command Line Interface Paradigm (\fBCLIP\fR). 
.sp
Each long option is an alias for a short option and is specified in parentheses following its equivalent short option.  For example, you can specify the long option \fBfile\fR as an alias for the short option \fBf\fR using the following script line:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
getopts "f(file)" opt
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Precede long options on the command line with \fB--\fR or \fB++\fR. In the example above, \fB--file\fR on the command line would be the equivalent of \fB-f\fR, and \fB++file\fR on the command line would be the equivalent of \fB+f\fR.
.sp
Each short option can have multiple long option equivalents, although this is in violation of the CLIP specification and should be used with caution. You must enclose each long option equivalent parentheses, as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
getopts "f:(file)(input-file)o:(output-file)"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

In the above example, both \fB--file\fR and \fB--input-file\fR are the equivalent of \fB-f\fR, and \fB--output-file\fR is the equivalent of \fB-o\fR.
.sp
The variable name is always set to a short option. When a long option is specified on the command line, name is set to the short-option equivalent.

\fB* \fBtrap\fR [ \fIarg\fR \fIsig\fR ... ]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fIarg\fR is a command to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) \fIsig\fR. \fIarg\fR is scanned once when the trap is set and once when the trap is taken. \fIsig\fR can be specified as a signal number or signal name. \fBtrap\fR commands are executed in order of signal number. Any attempt to set a trap on a signal number that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective. 
.sp
If \fIarg\fR is \fB\(mi\fR, the shell resets each \fIsig\fR to the default value. If \fIarg\fR is null (\fB\&''\fR), the shell ignores each specified \fIsig\fR if it arises. Otherwise, \fIarg\fR is read and executed by the shell when one of the corresponding \fIsigs\fR arises. The action of the trap overrides a previous action (either default action or one explicitly set). The value of \fB$?\fR after the trap action completes is the value it had before the trap was invoked.
.sp
\fIsig\fR can be \fBEXIT,\fR \fB0\fR (equivalent to \fBEXIT)\fR or a signal specified using a symbolic name, without the \fBSIG\fR prefix, for example, \fBHUP\fR, \fBINT\fR, \fBQUIT\fR, \fBTERM\fR. If \fIsig\fR is \fB0\fR or \fBEXIT\fR and the \fBtrap\fR statement is executed inside the body of a function, then the command \fIarg\fR is executed after the function completes. If \fIsig\fR is \fB0\fR or \fBEXIT\fR for a \fBtrap\fR set outside any function, the command \fIarg\fR is executed on exit from the shell. If \fIsig\fR is \fBERR\fR, \fIarg\fR is executed whenever a command has a non-zero exit status. If \fIsig\fR is \fBDEBUG\fR, \fIarg\fR is executed after each command.
.sp
The environment in which the shell executes a trap on \fBEXIT\fR is identical to the environment immediately after the last command executed before the trap on \fBEXIT\fR was taken.
.sp
Each time the trap is invoked, \fIarg\fR is processed in a manner equivalent to \fBeval "$arg"\fR.
.sp
Signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell cannot be trapped or reset, although no error need be reported when attempting to do so. An interactive shell can reset or catch signals ignored on entry. Traps remain in place for a given shell until explicitly changed with another \fBtrap\fR command.
.sp
When a subshell is entered, traps are set to the default args. This does not imply that the \fBtrap\fR command cannot be used within the subshell to set new traps.
.sp
The \fBtrap\fR command with no arguments writes to standard output a list of commands associated with each sig. The format is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
trap \(mi\(mi %s %s ... \fI<arg>\fR, \fI<sig>\fR ...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The shell formats the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same trapping results. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBsave_traps=$(trap)
\&.\|.\|.
eval "$save_traps"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

If the trap name or number is invalid, a non-zero exit status is returned. Otherwise, \fB0\fR is returned. For both interactive and non-interactive shells, invalid signal names or numbers are not considered a syntax error and dol not cause the shell to abort.
.sp
Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for a foreground process. Thus, a trap on \fBCHLD\fR won't be executed until the foreground job terminates.

The restrictions above are enforced after \fB\&.profile\fR and the \fBENV\fR files are interpreted.

.LP
When a command to be executed is found to be a shell procedure, \fBrksh\fR invokes \fBksh\fR to execute it. Thus, it is possible to provide to the end-user shell procedures that have access to the full power of the standard shell, while imposing a limited menu of commands; this scheme assumes that the end-user does not have write and execute permissions in the same directory.
.sp
.LP
The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the \fB\&.profile\fR has complete control over user actions, by performing guaranteed setup actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory (probably \fInot\fR the login directory).
.sp
.LP
The system administrator often sets up a directory of commands (that is, \fB/usr/rbin\fR) that can be safely invoked by \fBrksh\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to return a non-zero exit status. Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of the last command executed (see also the \fBexit\fR command above). If the shell is being used non-interactively then execution of the shell file is abandoned. Run time errors detected by the shell are reported by printing the command or function name and the error condition. If the line number that the error occurred on is greater than one, then the line number is also printed in square brackets (\fB[]\fR) after the command or function name.
.sp
.LP
For a non-interactive shell, an error condition encountered by a special built-in or other type of utility causes the shell to write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit as shown in the following table:

Expansion errorexitsexits

.TE

.sp
.LP
An expansion error is one that occurs when the shell expansions are carried out (for example, \fB${x!y}\fR, because \fB!\fR is not a valid operator). An implementation can treat these as syntax errors if it is able to detect them during tokenization, rather than during expansion.
.sp
.LP
If any of the errors shown as "might exit" or "exits" occur in a subshell, the subshell exits or might exit with a non-zero status, but the script containing the subshell does not exit because of the error.
.sp
.LP
In all of the cases shown in the table, an interactive shell writes a diagnostic message to standard error without exiting.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBksh\fR and \fBrksh\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (2^31 bytes).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
Each command has an exit status that can influence the behavior of other shell commands. The exit status of commands that are not utilities is documented in this section. The exit status of the standard utilities is documented in their respective sections.
.sp
.LP
If a command is not found, the exit status is \fB127\fR. If the command name is found, but it is not an executable utility, the exit status is \fB126\fR. Applications that invoke utilities without using the shell should use these exit status values to report similar errors.
.sp
.LP
If a command fails during word expansion or redirection, its exit status is greater than zero.
.sp
.LP
When reporting the exit status with the special parameter \fB?\fR, the shell reports the full eight bits of exit status available. The exit status of a command that terminated because it received a signal reported as greater than \fB128\fR.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The use of \fBsetuid\fR shell scripts is \fIstrongly\fR discouraged.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If a command which is a \fItracked alias\fR is executed, and then a command with the same name is installed in a directory in the search path before the directory where the original command was found, the shell continues to \fBexec\fR the original command. Use the \fB-t\fR option of the \fBalias\fR command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
Some very old shell scripts contain a \fB^\fR as a synonym for the pipe character \fB|\fR.
.sp
.LP
Using the \fBfc\fR built-in command within a compound command causes the whole command to disappear from the history file.
.sp
.LP
The built-in command \fB\&.\fR\fIfile\fR reads the whole file before any commands are executed. Therefore, \fBalias\fR and \fBunalias\fR commands in the file does not apply to any functions defined in the file.
.sp
.LP
When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to execute a non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns an erroneous diagnostic message that the shell script file does not exist.
