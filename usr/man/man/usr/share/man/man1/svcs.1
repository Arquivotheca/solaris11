.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsvcs\fR command displays information about service instances as recorded in the service configuration repository.
.sp
.LP
The first form of this command prints one-line status listings for service instances specified by the arguments. Each instance is listed only once. With no arguments, all enabled service instances, even if temporarily disabled, are listed with the columns indicated below.
.sp
.LP
The second form prints one-line status listings for the dependencies or dependents of the service instances specified by the arguments.
.sp
.LP
The third form prints detailed information about specific services and instances.
.sp
.LP
The fourth form explains the states of service instances. For each argument, a block of human-readable text is displayed which explains what state the service is in, and why it is in that state. With no arguments, problematic services are described.
.sp
.LP
Error messages are printed to the standard error stream.
.sp
.LP
The output of this command can be used appropriately as input to the \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) command.

\fB\fBdependency\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Information about a dependency. The grouping and \fBrestart_on\fR properties are displayed first and are separated by a forward slash (\fB/\fR). Next, each entity and its state is listed. See \fBsmf\fR(5) for information about states. In addition to the standard states, each service dependency can have the following state descriptions:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBabsent\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
No such service is defined on the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBinvalid\fR\fR

.sp
A service might be temporarily disabled because an administrator has run \fBsvcadm disable -t\fR, used \fBsvcadm milestone\fR, or booted the system to a specific milestone. See \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) for details.

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIFMRI\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
A fault management resource identifier (FMRI) that specifies one or more instances (see \fBsmf\fR(5)). FMRIs can be abbreviated by specifying the instance name, or the trailing portion of the service name. For example, given the FMRI:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The following are valid abbreviations:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sendmail
:sendmail
smtp
smtp:sendmail
network/smtp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The following are invalid abbreviations:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
mail
network
network/smt
.fi
.in -2
.sp

If the FMRI specifies a service, then the command applies to all instances of that service, except when used with the \fB-D\fR option.
.sp
Abbreviated forms of FMRIs are unstable, and should not be used in scripts or other permanent tools.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
A pattern that is matched against the \fIFMRI\fRs of service instances according to the globbing rules described by \fBfnmatch\fR(5). If the pattern does not begin with \fBsvc:\fR, then \fBsvc:/\fR is prepended. The following is a typical example of a glob pattern:
.sp

\fBExample 6 \fRExplaining Service States Using \fBsvcs\fR \fB-x\fR
.sp
.LP
(a) In this example, \fBsvcs\fR \fB-x\fR has identified that the print/server service being disabled is the root cause of two services which are enabled but not online. \fBsvcs\fR \fB-xv\fR shows that those services are \fBprint/rfc1179\fR and \fBprint/ipp-listener\fR. This situation can be rectified by either enabling \fBprint/server\fR or disabling \fBrfc1179\fR and \fBipp-listener\fR.
