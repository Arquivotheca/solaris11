.SH NAME
dis \- object code disassembler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdis\fR [\fB-onqCLV\fR] [\fB-d\fR \fIsec\fR] [\fB-D\fR \fIsec\fR] [\fB-F\fR \fIfunction\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdis\fR command produces an assembly language listing of \fIfile\fR, which can be an object file or an archive of object files. The listing includes assembly statements and an octal or hexadecimal representation of the binary that produced those statements.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Options are interpreted by the disassembler and can be specified in any order.
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Displays demangled C++ symbol names in the disassembly.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIsec\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Disassembles the named section as data, printing the offset of the data from the beginning of the section.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIsec\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Disassembles the named section as data, printing the actual address of the data.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIfunction\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Disassembles only the named function in each object file specified on the command line. The \fB-F\fR option can be specified multiple times on the command line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIstring\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Disassembles the archive file specified by \fIstring\fR. For example, one would issue the command \fBdis\fR \fB-l\fR \fBx\fR \fB-l\fR \fBz\fR to disassemble \fBlibx.a\fR and \fBlibz.a\fR, which are assumed to be in \fBLIBDIR\fR.
.sp
This option is obsolete and might be removed in a future release of Solaris.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Invokes a lookup of C-language source labels in the symbol table for subsequent writing to standard output.
.sp
This option is obsolete and might be removed in a future release of Solaris.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Displays all addresses numerically. Addresses are displayed using symbolic names by default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Prints numbers in octal. The default is hexadecimal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Quiet mode.  Does not print any headers or function entry labels.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fIsec\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Disassembles the named section as text.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-V\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Prints, on standard error, the version number of the disassembler being executed.
.sp
This option is obsolete and might be removed in a future release of Solaris.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If the \fB-d\fR, \fB-D\fR, or \fB-t\fR options are specified, only those named sections from each user-supplied file is disassembled. Otherwise, all sections containing text is disassembled.
.sp
.LP
On output, a number enclosed in brackets at the beginning of a line, such as \fB[5]\fR, indicates that the break-pointable line number starts with the following instruction. These line numbers is printed only if the file was compiled with additional debugging information.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
A path name of an object file or an archive (see \fBar\fR(1)) of object files.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBdis\fR: \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLIBDIR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
If this environment variable contains a value, use this as the path to search for the library. If the variable contains a null value, or is not set, it defaults to searching for the library under \fB/usr/lib\fR.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2

.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR

Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
