.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBscp\fR utility copies files between hosts on a network. It uses \fBssh\fR(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as \fBssh\fR(1). Unlike \fBrcp\fR(1), \fBscp\fR will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.
.sp
.LP
Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host. Copies between two remote hosts are permitted.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Compression enable. Passes the \fB-C\fR flag to \fBssh\fR(1) to enable compression.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIssh_config\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for \fBssh\fR(1.).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIidentity_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for \fBRSA\fR authentication is read. This option is directly passed to \fBssh\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIssh_option\fR\fR
.ad

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIport\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host. Notice that this option is written with a capital `P', because \fB-p\fR is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in \fBrcp\fR(1).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Generally, use of \fBscp\fR with password or keyboard-interactive authentication  method and two remote hosts does not work. It does work with either the \fBpubkey\fR,  \fBhostbased\fR or \fBgssapi-keyex\fR authentication method. For the \fBpubkey\fR authentication  method, either private keys not protected by a passphrase, or an explicit \fBssh\fR  agent forwarding have to be used. The \fBgssapi-keyex\fR authentication method  works with the \fBkerberos_v5\fR GSS-API mechanism, but only if  the \fBGSSAPIDelegateCredentials\fR option is enabled.
