.SH NAME
ctwatch \- watch events in a contract or group of contracts
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBctwatch\fR utility allows a user to observe the events occurring within a set of contracts or contract types. By default, \fBctwatch\fR watches all contracts.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Report events starting at the front of the event queue. Normally, \fBctwatch\fR reports only events which occur after it has been invoked. With the \fB-f\fR option, any events that still exist in the contracts' event queues when \fBctwatch\fR is invoked (for example, unacknowledged critical events) are also reported.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Reliably watches all messages. Normally, the system may drop informative events and acknowledged critical events at any time, so \fBctwatch\fR isn't guaranteed to see them all. This option may only be used if the \fBctwatch\fR is invoked with the \fB{PRIV_CONTRACT_EVENT}\fR privilege asserted in its effective set.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Ordering of events is only guaranteed within a single contract, or within a single type when a type is specified.
.sp
.LP
\fBctwatch\fR can only observe those events which are generated by contracts owned or authored by processes with the same effective user ID as \fBctwatch\fR, unless the \fB{PRIV_CONTRACT_OBSERVER}\fR privilege is asserted in its effective set.
