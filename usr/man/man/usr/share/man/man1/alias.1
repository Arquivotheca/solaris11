.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBalias\fR and \fBunalias\fR utilities create or remove a pseudonym or shorthand term for a command or series of commands, with different functionality in the C-shell and Korn shell environments.
.SS "\fB/usr/bin/alias\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBalias\fR utility creates or redefines alias definitions or writes the values of existing alias definitions to standard output. An alias definition provides a string value that replaces a command name when it is encountered.
.sp
.LP
An alias definition affects the current shell execution environment and the execution environments of the subshells of the current shell. When used as specified by this document, the alias definition does not affect the parent process of the current shell nor any utility environment invoked by the shell.
.SS "\fB/usr/bin/unalias\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBunalias\fR utility removes the definition for each alias name specified. The aliases are removed from the current shell execution environment. The \fB-a\fR option removes all alias definitions from the current execution environment.
.SS "\fBcsh\fR"
.sp
.LP
\fBalias\fR assigns \fIdef\fR to the alias \fIname\fR. The assigned \fIdef\fR is a list of words that can contain escaped history-substitution metasyntax. \fIname\fR is not allowed to be \fBalias\fR or \fBunalias\fR. If \fIdef\fR is omitted, the alias \fIname\fR is displayed along with its current definition. If both \fIname\fR and \fIdef\fR are omitted, all aliases are displayed.
.sp
.LP
Because of implementation restrictions, an alias definition must have been entered on a previous command line before it can be used.
.sp
.LP
\fBunalias\fR discards aliases that match (filename substitution) \fIpattern\fR. All aliases can be removed by `\fBunalias *\fR'.
.SS "\fBksh88\fR"
.sp
.LP
\fBalias\fR with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form \fIname=value\fR on standard output. An \fBalias\fR is defined for each name whose \fIvalue\fR is specified. A trailing space in \fIvalue\fR causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution. The \fB-t\fR flag is used to set and list tracked aliases. The value of a tracked alias is the full pathname corresponding to the specified \fIname\fR. The value becomes undefined when the value of \fBPATH\fR is reset but the aliases remained tracked. Without the \fB-t\fR flag, for each \fIname\fR in the argument list for which no \fIvalue\fR is specified, the name and value of the alias is printed. The \fB-x\fR flag is used to set or print \fIexported alias\fRes. An exported alias is defined for scripts invoked by \fIname\fR. The exit status is non-zero if a \fIname\fR is specified, but no value, and no alias has been defined for the \fIname\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBalias\fRs specified by the list of \fIname\fRs can be removed from the \fBalias\fR list with \fBunalias\fR.
.SS "\fBksh\fR"
.sp
.LP
\fBalias\fR creates or redefines alias definitions or writes the existing alias definitions to standard output. 
.sp
.LP
An alias definition provides a string value that replaces a command name when the command is read. Alias names can contain any printable character that is not special to the shell. If an alias value ends in a SPACE or TAB, the word following the command name the alias replaces is also checked to see whether it is an alias. 
.sp
.LP
If no names are specified, the names and values of all aliases are written to standard output. Otherwise, for each name that is specified, and \fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR is not specified, the current value of the alias corresponding to name is written to standard output. If \fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR is specified, the alias name is created or redefined. 
.sp
.LP
\fBalias\fR is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the arguments. Tilde expansion occurs on \fIvalue\fR. An alias definition only affects scripts read by the current shell environment. It does not affect scripts run by this shell. 
.sp
.LP
\fBunalias\fR removes the definition of each named alias from the current shell execution environment, or all aliases if \fB-a\fR is specified. It does not affect any commands that have already been read and subsequently executed.
