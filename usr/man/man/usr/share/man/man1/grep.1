.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgrep\fR utility searches text files for a pattern and prints all lines that contain that pattern.  It uses a compact non-deterministic algorithm.
.sp
.LP
Be careful using the characters \fB$\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB^\fR, \fB|\fR, \fB(\fR, \fB)\fR, and \fB\e\fR in the \fIpattern_list\fR because they are also meaningful to the shell. It is safest to enclose the entire \fIpattern_list\fR in single quotes \fBa\'\fR\&...\fBa\'\fR\&.
.sp
.LP
If no files are specified, \fBgrep\fR assumes standard input. Normally, each line found is copied to standard output. The file name is printed before each line found if there is more than one input file.
.SS "/usr/bin/grep"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/grep\fR utility uses limited regular expressions like those described on the \fBregexp\fR(5) manual page to match the patterns.
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/grep"
.sp
.LP
The options \fB-E\fR and \fB-F\fR affect the way \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR interprets \fIpattern_list\fR. If \fB-E\fR is specified, \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR interprets \fIpattern_list\fR as a full regular expression (see \fB-E\fR for description).  If \fB-F\fR is specified, \fBgrep\fR interprets \fIpattern_list\fR as a fixed string. If neither are specified, \fBgrep\fR interprets \fIpattern_list\fR as a basic regular expression as described on \fBregex\fR(5) manual page.
.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported for both \fB/usr/bin/grep\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR

Prevents the name of the file containing the matching line from being prepended to that line.  Used when searching multiple files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Precedes each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Quiet. Does not write anything to the standard output, regardless of matching lines. Exits with zero status if an input line is selected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Suppresses error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Prints all lines except those that contain the pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt

.RE

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/grep"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR only:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIpattern_list\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Specifies one or more patterns to be used during the search for input. Patterns in \fIpattern_list\fR must be separated by a NEWLINE character. A null pattern can be specified by two adjacent newline characters in \fIpattern_list\fR. Unless the \fB-E\fR or \fB-F\fR option is also specified, each pattern is treated as a basic regular expression.  Multiple \fB-e\fR and \fB-f\fR options are accepted by \fBgrep\fR. All of the specified patterns are used when matching lines, but the order of evaluation is unspecified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Matches using full regular expressions. Treats each pattern specified as a full regular expression. If any entire full regular expression pattern matches an input line, the line is matched. A null full regular expression matches every line. Each pattern is interpreted as a full regular expression as described on the \fBregex\fR(5) manual page, except for \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR, and including: 
.RS +4
.TP
1.
A full regular expression followed by \fB+\fR that matches one or more occurrences of the full regular expression.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
A full regular expression followed by \fB?\fR that matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the full regular expression.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Full regular expressions separated by | or by a new-line that match strings that are matched by any of the expressions.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
A full regular expression that is enclosed in parentheses \fB()\fR for grouping.
.RE
The order of precedence of operators is \fB[\|]\fR, then \fB*\|?\|+\fR, then concatenation, then | and new-line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIpattern_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Reads one or more patterns from the file named by the path name \fIpattern_file\fR. Patterns in \fIpattern_file\fR are terminated by a NEWLINE character. A null pattern can be specified by an empty line in \fIpattern_file\fR. Unless the \fB-E\fR or \fB-F\fR option is also specified, each pattern is treated as a basic regular expression.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Matches using fixed strings. Treats each pattern specified as a string instead of a regular expression. If an input line contains any of the patterns as a contiguous sequence of bytes, the line is matched. A null string matches every line. See \fBfgrep\fR(1) for more information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
.rt  
Considers only input lines that use all characters in the line to match an entire fixed string or regular expression to be matching lines.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
A path name of a file to be searched for the patterns. If no \fIfile\fR operands are specified, the standard input is used.
.RE

.SS "/usr/bin/grep"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Specifies a pattern to be used during the search for input.
.RE

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/grep"
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Specifies one or more patterns to be used during the search for input. This operand is treated as if it were specified as \fB-e\fR \fIpattern_list\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fB-c\fR, \fB-l\fR and \fB-q\fR options are mutually exclusive. If specified together \fB-q\fR overrides \fB-c\fR which overrides \fB-l\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-e\fR \fIpattern_list\fR option has the same effect as the \fIpattern_list\fR operand, but is useful when \fIpattern_list\fR begins with the hyphen delimiter. It is also useful when it is more convenient to provide multiple patterns as separate arguments.
.sp
.LP
Multiple \fB-e\fR and \fB-f\fR options are accepted and \fBgrep\fR uses all of the patterns it is given while matching input text lines. Notice that the order of evaluation is not specified. If an implementation finds a null string as a pattern, it is allowed to use that pattern first, matching every line, and effectively ignore any other patterns.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-q\fR option provides a means of easily determining whether or not a pattern (or string) exists in a group of files. When searching several files, it provides a performance improvement (because it can quit as soon as it finds the first match) and requires less care by the user in choosing the set of files to supply as arguments (because it exits zero if it finds a match even if \fBgrep\fR detected an access or read error on earlier file operands).
.SS "Large File Behavior"
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBgrep\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES

.SH NOTES
.SS "/usr/bin/grep"
.sp
.LP
Lines are limited only by the size of the available virtual memory. If there is a line with embedded nulls, \fBgrep\fR only matches up to the first null. If the line matches, the entire line is printed.
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/grep"
.sp
.LP
The results are unspecified if input files contain lines longer than \fBLINE_MAX\fR bytes or contain binary data. \fBLINE_MAX\fR is defined in \fB/usr/include/limits.h\fR.
