.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnice\fR utility invokes \fBcommand\fR, requesting that it be run with a different system scheduling priority. The \fBpriocntl\fR(1) command is a more general interface to scheduler functions.
.sp
.LP
The invoking process (generally the user's shell) must be in a scheduling class that supports \fBnice\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the C shell (see \fBcsh\fR(1)) is used, the full path of the command must be specified. Otherwise, the \fBcsh\fR built-in version of \fBnice\fR will be invoked. See \fBcsh Builtin\fR below.
.SS "/usr/bin/nice"
.sp
.LP
If \fBnice\fR executes commands with arguments, it uses the default shell \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR (see \fBsh\fR(1)).
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/nice"
.sp
.LP
If \fBnice\fR executes commands with arguments, it uses \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sh\fR (see \fBksh88\fR(1)).
.SS "csh Builtin"
.sp
.LP
\fBnice\fR is also a \fBcsh\fR built-in command with behavior different from the utility versions.  See \fBcsh\fR(1) for description.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-\fR\fIincrement\fR | \fB-n\fR \fIincrement\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
\fIincrement\fR is a positive or negative decimal integer that has the same effect on the execution of the utility as if the utility had called the \fBnice()\fR function with the numeric value of the \fIincrement\fR option-argument. See \fBnice\fR(2). \fBnice()\fR errors, other than \fBEINVAL\fR, are ignored. If not specified, an increment of \fB10\fR is assumed.
.sp
The super-user may run commands with priority higher than normal by using a negative increment such as \fB-10\fR\&. A negative \fIincrement\fR assigned by an unprivileged user is ignored.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The name of a command that is to be invoked. If \fIcommand\fR names any of the special built-in utilities (see \fBshell_builtins\fR(1)), the results are undefined.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIargument\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking \fIcommand\fR.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBnice\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBPATH\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
If \fIcommand\fR is invoked, the exit status of \fBnice\fR will be the exit status of \fIcommand\fR. Otherwise, \fBnice\fR will exit with one of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB1-125\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
An error occurred. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB126\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
\fIcommand\fR was found but could not be invoked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB127\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n

\fIcommand\fR could not be found.
