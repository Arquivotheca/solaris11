.SH NAME
pargs \- print  process  arguments,  environment  variables,  or auxiliary vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpargs\fR [\fB-aceFlx\fR] [\fIpid\fR | \fIcore\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpargs\fR utility examines a target process or process core file and prints arguments, environment variables and values, or the process auxiliary vector.
.sp
.LP
\fBpargs\fR outputs unprintable characters as escaped octal in the format \fB\e\fR\fIxxx\fR, unless the character is  one of the characters specified in the "\fBEscape Sequences\fR" section of \fBformats\fR(5), in which case the character is  printed as specified in that section.
.sp
.LP
\fBpargs\fR attempts to be sensitive to the locale of the target process. If the target process and the \fBpargs\fR process do not share a common character encoding, \fBpargs\fR attempts to employ the \fBiconv\fR(3C) facility to generate a printable version of the extracted  strings. In the event that such a conversion is impossible, strings are displayed as 7-bit \fBASCII\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Prints process arguments as contained in \fBargv[]\fR (default).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Treats strings  in the target process as  though they were encoded in 7-bit \fBASCII\fR, regardless of the locale of the target. The use of \fBiconv\fR(3C) is suppressed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Prints process environment variables and values as pointed at by the \fB_environ\fR symbol or by \fBpr_envp\fR in \fB/proc/\fIpid\fR/psinfo\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Force. Grabs the target process even if another process has control.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Displays the arguments as a single command line. The command line is printed in a manner suitable for interpretation by \fB/bin/sh\fR. If the arguments contain unprintable characters, or if the target process is in a different locale, a warning message is displayed. The resulting command line might not be interpreted correctly by \fB/bin/sh\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Prints process auxiliary vector.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
Process \fBID\fR list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcore\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
Process core file.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Caution should be exercised when using the \fB-F\fR flag. Imposing two controlling processes on one victim process can lead to chaos. Safety is assured only if the primary controlling process, typically a debugger, has stopped the victim process and the primary controlling process is doing nothing at the moment of application of the \fBproc\fR tool in question.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Successful operation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBnon-zero\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
An error has occurred (such as no such process, permission denied, or invalid option).
.RE

.SH FILES
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB/proc/pid/*\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Process information and control files.
