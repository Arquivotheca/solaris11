.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBssh-keyscan\fR is a utility for gathering the public ssh host keys of a number of hosts. It was designed to aid in building and verifying \fBssh_known_hosts\fR files. \fBssh-keyscan\fR provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl scripts. The output of \fBssh-keyscan\fR is directed to standard output.
.sp
.LP
\fBssh-keyscan\fR uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient. The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not run ssh. For scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve any encryption.

.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Read hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from this file, one per line. If you specity - instead of a filename, \fBssh-keyscan\fR reads hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from the standard input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Port to connect to on the remote host.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fItimeout\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Set the timeout for connection attempts. If \fItimeout\fR seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the last time anything was read from that host, the connection is closed and the host in question is considered unavailable. The default is for \fItimeout\fR is 5 seconds.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItype\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts. The possible values for \fItype\fR are \fBrsa1\fR for protocol version 1 and \fBrsa\fR or \fBdsa\fR for protocol version 2. Specify multiple values by separating them with commas. The default is \fBrsa1\fR.

.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
If a \fBssh_known_hosts\fR file is constructed using \fBssh-keyscan\fR without verifying the keys, users are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. If the security model allows such a risk, \fBssh-keyscan\fR can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man-in-the-middle attacks which have begun after the \fBssh_known_hosts\fR file was created.
.SH EXAMPLES

\fBExample 1 \fRPrinting the \fBrsa1\fR Host Key

\fBExample 2 \fRFinding All Hosts
.sp
.LP
The following commands finds all hosts from the file \fBssh_hosts\fR which have new or different keys from those in the sorted file \fBssh_known_hosts\fR:

.sp
.in +2
