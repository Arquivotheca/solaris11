.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBps\fR command prints information about active processes. Without options, \fBps\fR prints information about processes that have the same effective user \fBID\fR and the same controlling terminal as the invoker. The output contains only the process \fBID\fR, terminal identifier, cumulative execution time, and the command name. Otherwise, the information that is displayed is controlled by the options.
.sp
.LP
Some options accept lists as arguments. Items in a list can be either separated by commas or else enclosed in quotes and separated by commas or spaces. Values for \fIproclist\fR and \fIgrplist\fR must be numeric.
.sp
.LP
The \fBps\fR command tries to determine whether it is called natively or using  	the command syntax expected by \fBps\fR(1B).  In the latter case, the 	\fBps\fR command behaves exactly as described in \fBps\fR(1B).

Prints the name of the zone with which the process is associated under an additional column header, \fBZONE\fR. The \fBZONE\fR column width is limited to 8 characters. Use \fBps\fR \fB-eZ\fR for a quick way to see information about every process now running along with the associated zone name. Use

to see zone names wider than 8 characters.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Many of the options shown are used to select processes to list. If any are specified, the default list is ignored and \fBps\fR selects the processes represented by the inclusive OR of all the selection-criteria options.
.SH DISPLAY FORMATS
.sp
.LP
Under the \fB-f\fR option, \fBps\fR tries to determine the command name and arguments given when the process was created by examining the user block. Failing this, the command name is printed, as it would have appeared without the \fB-f\fR option, in square brackets.
.sp
.LP
The column headings and the meaning of the columns in a \fBps\fR listing are given below; the letters \fBf\fR and \fBl\fR indicate the option (f\fBull\fR or \fBl\fRong, respectively) that causes the corresponding heading to appear; \fBall\fR means that the heading always appears. \fBNote:\fR These two options determine only what information is provided for a process; they do not determine which processes are listed.

The format specification must be a list of names presented as a single argument, blank- or comma-separated. Each variable has a default header. The default header can be overridden by appending an equals sign and the new text of the header. The rest of the characters in the argument is used as the header text. The fields specified are written in the order specified on the command line, and should be arranged in columns in the output. The field widths are selected by the system to be at least as wide as the header text (default or overridden value). If the header text is null, such as \fB-o\fR \fIuser=,\fR the field width is at least as wide as the default header text. If all header text fields are null, no header line is written.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Things can change while \fBps\fR is running. The snapshot it gives is true only for a split-second, and it might not be accurate by the time you see it. Some data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant.
.sp
.LP
If no options to select processes are specified, \fBps\fR reports all processes associated with the controlling terminal. If there is no controlling terminal, there is no report other than the header.
.sp
.LP
\fBps\fR \fB-ef\fR or \fBps\fR \fB-o\fR \fBstime\fR might not report the actual start of a tty login session, but rather an earlier time, when a \fBgetty\fR was last respawned on the \fBtty\fR line.
.sp
.LP
On prior releases the \fBADDR\fR and \fBWCHAN\fR fields might have contained the kernel memory address of the process and/or event it was waiting on. These fields are now always \fB0\fR unless requested by a process running with all privilege. The values can still be obtained using the \fB::ps and ::thread dcmds\fR within \fBmdb\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBps\fR is \fBCSI\fR-enabled except for login names (usernames).
