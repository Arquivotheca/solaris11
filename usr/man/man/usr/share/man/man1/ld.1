.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The link-editor, \fBld\fR, combines relocatable object files by resolving symbol references to symbol definitions, together with performing relocations. \fBld\fR operates in two modes, static or dynamic, as governed by the \fB-d\fR option. In all cases, the default output of \fBld\fR is left in the file \fBa.out\fR. See NOTES.
.sp
.LP
In dynamic mode, \fB-dy\fR, the default, relocatable object files that are provided as arguments are combined to produce a dynamic executable file. This file is combined at runtime with any shared object files that are provided as arguments. If the \fB-G\fR option is specified, relocatable object files are combined to produce a shared object file. Without the \fB-G\fR option, a dynamic executable file is created.
.sp
.LP
In static mode, \fB-dn\fR, relocatable object files that are provided as arguments are combined to produce a static executable file. If the \fB-r\fR option is specified, relocatable object files are combined to produce one relocatable object file. See \fBStatic Executables\fR.
.sp
.LP
The Solaris environment uses dynamic linking to combine relocatable objects into dynamic executables and shared objects. This environment tightly couples the work of the link-editor and the runtime linker, \fBld.so.1\fR(1). Both of these utilities, together with their related technologies and utilities, are extensively documented in the \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.sp
.LP
If any argument is a library, \fBld\fR by default searches the library exactly once at the point the library is encountered on the argument list. The library can be either a shared object or relocatable archive. See \fBar.h\fR(3HEAD)).
.sp
.LP
A shared object consists of an indivisible, whole unit that has been generated by a previous link-edit of one or more input files. When the link-editor processes a shared object, the entire contents of the shared object become a logical part of the resulting output file image. The shared object is not physically copied during the link-edit as its actual inclusion is deferred until process execution. This logical inclusion means that all symbol entries defined in the shared object are made available to the link-editing process. See Chapter 4, \fIShared Objects,\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR
.sp
.LP
For an archive library, \fBld\fR loads only those routines that define an unresolved external reference. \fBld\fR searches the symbol table of the archive library sequentially to resolve external references that can be satisfied by library members. This search is repeated until no external references can be resolved by the archive. Thus, the order of members in the library is functionally unimportant, unless multiple library members exist that define the same external symbol. Archive libraries that have interdependencies can require multiple command line definitions, or the use of one of the \fB-z\fR \fBrescan\fR options. See \fIArchive Processing\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBld\fR is a cross link-editor, able to link 32-bit objects or 64-bit objects, for SPARC or x86 targets. \fBld\fR uses the \fBELF\fR class and machine type of the first relocatable object on the command line to govern the mode in which to operate. The mixing of 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects is not permitted. Similarly, only objects of a single machine type are allowed. See the \fB-32\fR, \fB-64\fR and \fB-z target\fR options, and the \fBLD_NOEXEC_64\fR environment variable.
.SS "Static Executables"
.sp
.LP
The creation of static executables has been discouraged for many releases. In fact, 64-bit system archive libraries have never been provided. Because a static executable is built against system archive libraries, the executable contains system implementation details. This self-containment has a number of drawbacks.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The executable is immune to the benefits of system patches delivered as shared objects. The executable therefore, must be rebuilt to take advantage of many system improvements.
.RE

.RE
.sp
.LP
With Solaris 10, 32-bit system archive libraries are no longer provided. Without these libraries, specifically \fBlibc.a\fR, the creation of static executables is no longer achievable without specialized system knowledge. However, the capability of \fBld\fR to process static linking options, and the processing of archive libraries, remains unchanged.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-32\fR | \fB-64\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Creates a 32-bit, or 64-bit object.
.sp
By default, the class of the object being generated is determined from the first \fBELF\fR object processed from the command line. If no objects are specified, the class is determined by the first object encountered within the first archive processed from the command line. If there are no objects or archives, the link-editor creates a 32-bit object.
.sp
The \fB-64\fR option is required to create a 64-bit object solely from a \fBmapfile\fR.
.sp
The \fB-32\fR or \fB-64\fR options can also be used in the rare case of linking entirely from an archive that contains a mixture of 32 and 64-bit objects. If the first object in the archive is not the class of the object that is required to be created, then the \fB-32\fR or \fB-64\fR option can be used to direct the link-editor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In static mode only, produces a static executable file. Undefined references are not permitted. This option is the default behavior for static mode. The \fB-a\fR option can not be used with the \fB-r\fR option. See \fBStatic Executables\fR under DESCRIPTION.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In dynamic mode only, provides no special processing for dynamic executable relocations that reference symbols in shared objects. Without the \fB-b\fR option, the link-editor applies techniques within a dynamic executable so that the text segment can remain read-only. One technique is the creation of special position-independent relocations for references to functions that are defined in shared objects. Another technique arranges for data objects that are defined in shared objects to be copied into the memory image of an executable at runtime.
.sp
The \fB-b\fR option is intended for specialized dynamic objects and is not recommended for general use. Its use suppresses all specialized processing required to ensure an object's shareability, and can even prevent the relocation of 64-bit executables.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBdirect\fR | \fBnodirect\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
These options govern direct binding. \fB-B\fR \fBdirect\fR establishes direct binding information by recording the relationship between each symbol reference together with the dependency that provides the definition. In addition, direct binding information is established between each symbol reference and an associated definition within the object being created. The runtime linker uses this information to search directly for a symbol in the associated object rather than to carry out a default symbol search.
.sp
Direct binding information can only be established to dependencies specified with the link-edit. Thus, you should use the \fB-z\fR \fBdefs\fR option. Objects that wish to interpose on symbols in a direct binding environment should identify themselves as interposers with the \fB-z\fR \fBinterpose\fR option. The use of \fB-B\fR \fBdirect\fR enables \fB-z\fR \fBlazyload\fR for all dependencies.
.sp
The \fB-B\fR \fBnodirect\fR option prevents any direct binding to the interfaces offered by the object being created. The object being created can continue to directly bind to external interfaces by specifying the \fB-z\fR \fBdirect\fR option. See Chapter 9, \fIDirect Bindings,\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBdynamic\fR | \fBstatic\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Options governing library inclusion. \fB-B\fR \fBdynamic\fR is valid in dynamic mode only. These options can be specified any number of times on the command line as toggles: if the \fB-B\fR \fBstatic\fR option is given, no shared objects are accepted until \fB-B\fR \fBdynamic\fR is seen. See the \fB-l\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBeliminate\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Causes any global symbols, not assigned to a version definition, to be eliminated from the symbol table. Version definitions can be supplied by means of a \fBmapfile\fR to indicate the global symbols that should remain visible in the generated object. This option achieves the same symbol elimination as the \fIauto-elimination\fR directive that is available as part of a \fBmapfile\fR version definition. This option can be useful when combining versioned and non-versioned relocatable objects. See also the \fB-B\fR \fBlocal\fR option and the \fB-B\fR \fBreduce\fR option. See \fISYMBOL_SCOPE / SYMBOL_VERSION Directives\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Establishes a shared object and its dependencies as a group. Objects within the group are bound to other members of the group at runtime. This mode is similar to adding the object to the process by using \fBdlopen\fR(3C) with the \fBRTLD_GROUP\fR mode. An object that has an explicit dependency on a object identified as a group, becomes a member of the group.
.sp
As the group must be self contained, use of the \fB-B\fR \fBgroup\fR option also asserts the \fB-z\fR \fBdefs\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBlocal\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Causes any global symbols, not assigned to a version definition, to be reduced to local. Version definitions can be supplied by means of a \fBmapfile\fR to indicate the global symbols that should remain visible in the generated object. This option achieves the same symbol reduction as the \fIauto-reduction\fR directive that is available as part of a \fBmapfile\fR version definition. This option can be useful when combining versioned and non-versioned relocatable objects. See also the \fB-B\fR \fBeliminate\fR option and the \fB-B\fR \fBreduce\fR option. See \fISYMBOL_SCOPE / SYMBOL_VERSION Directives\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBreduce\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When generating a relocatable object, causes the reduction of symbolic information defined by any version definitions. Version definitions can be supplied by means of a \fBmapfile\fR to indicate the global symbols that should remain visible in the generated object. By default, when a relocatable object is generated, version definitions are only recorded in the output image. The actual reduction of symbolic information is carried out when the object is used in the construction of a dynamic executable or shared object. The \fB-B\fR \fBreduce\fR option is applied automatically when a dynamic executable or shared object is created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-B\fR \fBsymbolic\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In dynamic mode only. When building a shared object, binds references to global symbols to their definitions, if available, within the object. Normally, references to global symbols within shared objects are not bound until runtime, even if definitions are available. This model allows definitions of the same symbol in an executable or other shared object to override the object's own definition. \fBld\fR issues warnings for undefined symbols unless \fB-z\fR \fBdefs\fR overrides.
.sp
The \fB-B\fR \fBsymbolic\fR option is intended for specialized dynamic objects and is not recommended for general use. To reduce the runtime relocation processing that is required an object, the creation of a version definition is recommended.

Searches a library \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.so\fR or \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.a\fR, the conventional names for shared object and archive libraries, respectively. In dynamic mode, unless the \fB-B\fR \fBstatic\fR option is in effect, \fBld\fR searches each directory specified in the library search path for a \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.so\fR or \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.a\fR file. The directory search stops at the first directory containing either. \fBld\fR chooses the file ending in \fB\&.so\fR if \fB-l\fR\fIx\fR expands to two files with names of the form \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.so\fR and \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.a\fR. If no \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.so\fR is found, then \fBld\fR accepts \fBlib\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.a\fR. In static mode, or when the \fB-B\fR \fBstatic\fR option is in effect, \fBld\fR selects only the file ending in \fB\&.a\fR. \fBld\fR searches a library when the library is encountered, so the placement of \fB-l\fR is significant.

A colon-separated list of directories used to specify library search directories to the runtime linker.

Multiple instances of this option are concatenated together with each \fIpath\fR separated by a colon. See \fIDirectories Searched by the Runtime Linker\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.

The use of a runpath within an associated object is preferable to setting global search paths such as through the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR environment variable. Only the runpaths that are necessary to find the objects dependencies should be recorded. \fBldd\fR(1) can also be used to discover unused runpaths in dynamic objects, when used with the \fB-U\fR option.

Various tokens can also be supplied with a runpath that provide a flexible means of identifying system capabilities or an objects location. See Chapter 6, \fIEstablishing Dependencies with Dynamic String Tokens,\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR. The \fB$ORIGIN\fR token is especially useful in allowing dynamic objects to be relocated to different locations in the file system.

By default, \fBld\fR combines multiple relocation sections when building executables or shared objects. This section combination differs from relocatable objects, in which relocation sections are maintained in a one-to-one relationship with the sections to which the relocations must be applied. The \fB-z\fR \fBnocombreloc\fR option disables this merging of relocation sections, and preserves the one-to-one relationship found in the original relocatable objects.
.sp
\fBld\fR sorts the entries of data relocation sections by their symbol reference. This sorting reduces runtime symbol lookup. When multiple relocation sections are combined, this sorting produces the least possible relocation overhead when objects are loaded into memory, and speeds the runtime loading of dynamic objects.
.sp
Historically, the individual relocation sections were carried over to any executable or shared object, and the \fB-z\fR \fBcombreloc\fR option was required to enable the relocation section merging previously described.

Eliminates all local symbols except for the \fISECT\fR symbols from the symbol table \fBSHT_SYMTAB\fR. All relocations that refer to local symbols are updated to refer to the corresponding \fISECT\fR symbol. This option allows specialized objects to greatly reduce their symbol table sizes.

Although useful for special objects such as those used within the operating system kernel, the \fB-z\fR \fBredlocsym\fR option is not recommended for general use. The size of the symbol table \fBSHT_SYMTAB\fR does not effect runtime behavior, and the elimination of local symbols can negatively effect process observability. Eliminated local symbols can reduce the debugging information that is generated using the compiler drivers \fB-g\fR option. Eliminated local symbols will also remove the information normally written to the \fB\&.SUNW_ldynsym\fR section, reducing the effectiveness of debuggers and tools such as \fBpstack\fR(1) and \fBtruss\fR(1).

These options rescan the archive files that are provided to the link-edit. By default, archives are processed once as the archives appear on the command line. Archives are traditionally specified at the end of the command line so that their symbol definitions resolve any preceding references. However, specifying archives multiple times to satisfy their own interdependencies can be necessary.
.sp
\fB-z\fR \fBrescan-now\fR is a positional option, and is processed by the link-editor immediately when encountered on the command line. All archives seen on the command line up to that point are immediately reprocessed in an attempt to locate additional archive members that resolve symbol references. This archive rescanning is repeated until a pass over the archives occurs in which no new members are extracted.
.sp
\fB-z\fR \fBrescan\fR is a position independent option. The link-editor defers the rescan operation until after it has processed the entire command line, and then initiates a final rescan operation over all archives seen on the command line. The \fB-z\fR \fBrescan\fR operation can interact incorrectly with objects that contain initialization (\&.init) or finalization (\&.fini) sections, preventing the code in those sections from running.

Produces a stub shared object. A stub object is a shared object, built entirely from \fBmapfiles\fR, that supplies the same linking interface as the real object, while containing no code or data. Stub objects cannot be used at runtime. However, an application can be built against a stub object, where the stub object provides the real object name to be used at runtime, and then use the real object at runtime.
.sp
Stub objects can only be produced for shared objects, and a \fBmapfile\fR defining the global symbols to be exported must be supplied. The \fB-G\fR and \fB-M\fR options are therefore required when \fB-z\fR \fBstub\fR is used. When building a stub object, the link-editor ignores any object or library files specified on the command line, and these files need not exist in order to build a stub. Since the compilation step can be omitted, and because the link-editor has relatively little work to do, stub objects can be built very quickly.

If no objects are specified, the machine type is determined by the first object encountered within the first archive processed from the command line. If there are no objects or archives, the link-editor assumes the native machine. This option is useful when creating an object directly with \fBld\fR whose input is solely from a \fBmapfile\fR.

.LP
Default options applied by \fBld\fR are maintained for historic reasons. In today's programming environment, where dynamic objects dominate, alternative defaults would often make more sense. However, historic defaults must be maintained to ensure compatibility with existing program development environments. Historic defaults are called out wherever possible in this manual. For a description of the current recommended options, see Chapter 7, \fILink-Editor Quick Reference,\fR in \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the file being created by \fBld\fR already exists, the file is unlinked after all input files have been processed. A new file with the specified name is then created. This allows \fBld\fR to create a new version of the file, while simultaneously allowing existing processes that are accessing the old file contents to continue running. If the old file has no other links, the disk space of the removed file is freed when the last process referencing the file terminates.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of \fBld\fR when the file being created already exists was changed with Solaris 11. In older versions, the existing file was rewritten in place, an approach with the potential to corrupt any running processes that is using the file. This change has an implication for output files that have multiple hard links in the file system. Previously, all links would remain intact, with all links accessing the new file contents. The new \fBld\fR behavior \fBbreaks\fR such links, with the result that only the specified output file name references the new file. All the other links continue to reference the old file. To ensure consistent behavior, applications that rely on multiple hard links to linker output files should explicitly remove and relink the other file names.
