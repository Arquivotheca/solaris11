.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpr\fR utility is a printing and pagination filter. If multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written to standard output. By default, the input is separated into 66-line pages, each with:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
a 5-line header that includes the page number, date, time and the path name of the file
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
a 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines
.RE
.sp
.LP
If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic messages will be deferred until the \fBpr\fR utility has completed processing.
.sp
.LP
When options specifying multi-column output are specified, output text columns will be of equal width; input lines that do not fit into a text column will be truncated. By default, text columns are separated with at least one blank character.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported. In the following option descriptions, \fIcolumn\fR, \fIlines\fR, \fIoffset\fR, \fIpage\fR, and \fIwidth\fR are positive decimal integers; \fIgap\fR is a non-negative decimal integer. Some of the option-arguments are optional, and some of the option-arguments cannot be specified as separate arguments from the preceding option letter. In particular, the \fB-s\fR option does not allow the option letter to be separated from its argument, and the options \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, and \fB-n\fR require that both arguments, if present, not be separated from the option letter.
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for both \fB/usr/bin/pr\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/pr\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIpage\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Begins output at page number \fIpage\fR of the formatted input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-\fR\fIcolumn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Produces multi-column output that is arranged in \fIcolumn\fR columns (default is \fB1\fR) and is written down each column in the order in which the text is received from the input file. This option should not be used with \fB-m\fR. The \fB-e\fR and \fB-i\fR options will be assumed for multiple text-column output. Whether or not text columns are produced with identical vertical lengths is unspecified, but a text column will never exceed the length of the page (see the \fB-l\fR option). When used with \fB-t\fR, use the minimum number of lines to write the output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Modifies the effect of the \fB-\fR\fIcolumn\fR option so that the columns are filled across the page in a round-robin order (for example, when \fIcolumn\fR is 2, the first input line heads column 1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second line in column 1, and so forth).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Produces output that is double-spaced; append an extra \fBNEWLINE\fR character following every \fBNEWLINE\fR character found in the input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\fR\fB-e\fR\fB\|[\|\fR\fIchar\fR\fB\|][\|\fR\fIgap\fR\fB\|]\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Expands each input \fBTAB\fR character to the next greater column position specified by the formula \fIn\fR \fI*gap+1\fR, where \fIn\fR is an integer \fB>0\fR. If \fIgap\fR is \fB0\fR or is omitted, it defaults to \fB8\fR. All \fBTAB\fR characters in the input will be expanded into the appropriate number of \fBSPACE\fR characters.  If any non-digit character, \fIchar\fR, is specified, it will be used as the input tab character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Uses a \fBFORMFEED\fR character for new pages, instead of the default behavior that uses a sequence of \fBNEWLINE\fR characters. Pauses before beginning the first page if the standard output is associated with a terminal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fIheader\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Uses the string \fIheader\fR to replace the contents of the \fIfile\fR operand in the page header.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIlines\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Overrides the 66-line default and reset the page length to \fIlines\fR. If \fIlines\fR is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer depths (in lines), \fBpr\fR will suppress both the header and trailer, as if the \fB-t\fR option were in effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Merges files. Standard output will be formatted so \fBpr\fR writes one line from each file specified by \fIfile\fR, side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in terms of the number of column positions. Implementations support merging of at least nine \fIfile\fRs.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\|[\|\fR\fIchar\fR\fB\|][\|\fR\fIwidth\fR\fB\|]\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Provides \fIwidth\fR-digit line numbering (default for \fIwidth\fR is \fB5\fR). The number will occupy the first \fIwidth\fR column positions of each text column of default output or each line of \fB-m\fR output. If \fIchar\fR (any non-digit character) is given, it will be appended to the line number to separate it from whatever follows (default for \fIchar\fR is a \fBTAB\fR character).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIoffset\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Each line of output will be preceded by offset <space>s. If the \fB-o\fR option is not specified, the default offset is \fB0\fR. The space taken will be in addition to the output line width (see \fB-w\fR option below).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Pauses before beginning each page if the standard output is directed to a terminal (\fBpr\fR will write an \fBALERT\fR character to standard error and wait for a carriage-return character to be read on \fB/dev/tty\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR

.RS 29n

Writes no diagnostic reports on failure to open files.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-s\fR \fB[\fR\fIchar\fR\fB]\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Separates text columns by the single character \fIchar\fR instead of by the appropriate number of \fBSPACE\fR characters (default for \fIchar\fR is the \fBTAB\fR character).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Writes neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-line trailer usually supplied for each page. Quits writing after the last line of each file without spacing to the end of the page.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 29n
.rt  
Sets the width of the line to \fIwidth\fR column positions for multiple text-column output only. If the \fB-w\fR option is not specified and the \fB-s\fR option is not specified, the default width is \fB72\fR. If the \fB-w\fR option is not specified and the \fB-s\fR option is specified, the default width is \fB512\fR.
.sp
For single column output, input lines will not be truncated.

.RS 27n
.rt  
Folds the lines of the input file. When used in multi-column mode (with the \fB-a\fR or \fB-m\fR options), lines will be folded to fit the current column's width. Otherwise, they will be folded to fit the current line width (80 columns).

In output, replaces \fBSPACE\fR characters with \fBTAB\fR characters wherever one or more adjacent \fBSPACE\fR characters reach column positions \fIgap+1\fR, \fI2*gap+1\fR, \fI3*gap+1\fR, and so forth. If \fIgap\fR is \fB0\fR or is omitted, default \fBTAB\fR settings at every eighth column position are assumed. If any non-digit character, \fIchar\fR, is specified, it will be used as the output \fBTAB\fR character.
