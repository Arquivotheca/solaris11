.SH DESCRIPTION

.na
\fB\fBlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lists on standard output information from a single certificate file or signed elf object. The selected field appears on a single line. If the field specified does not apply to the named file, the command terminates with no standard output. This output of this subcommand is intended for use in scripts and by other commands.

\fB\fBrequest\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Generates a private key and a PKCS#10 certificate request. The PKCS#10 certificate request for use with the Solaris Cryptographic Framework. If the private key is to be created in a token device, elfsign prompts for the PIN required to update the token device. The PKCS#10 certificate request should be sent to the email address \fIsolaris-crypto-req_ww@oracle.com\fR to obtain a Certificate.
.sp
Users of \fBelfsign\fR must first generate a certificate request and obtain a certificate before signing binaries for use with the Solaris Cryptographic Framework.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Generates a signed \fBELF\fR Sign Activation (\fB\&.esa\fR) file. This option is used when a cryptographic provider has nonretail export approval for unrestricted use and desires retail approval by restricting which export sensitive callers (for example, IPsec) can use the provider. This option assumes that the provider binary has previously been signed with a restricted certificate.

Formats other than \fBrsa_md5_sha1\fR include an informational timestamp with the signature indicating when the signature was applied. This timestamp is not cryptographically secure, nor is it used as part of verification.

The government of the United States of America restricts the export of
"open cryptographic interfaces", also known as "crypto-with-a-hole".
Due to this restriction, all providers for the Solaris cryptographic
framework must be signed, regardless of the country of origin.

The terms "retail" and "non-retail" refer to export classifications for
products manufactured in the USA. These terms define the portion of the
world where the product may be shipped.) Roughly speaking, "retail" is
worldwide (minus certain excluded nations) and "non-retail" is domestic
only (plus some highly favored nations). 
If your provider is subject to USA export control, then you 
must obtain an export approval (classification)
from the government of the USA before exporting your provider.
It is critical that you specify the obtained (or expected, when 
used during development) classification to the following questions 
so that your provider will be appropriately signed.

Do you have retail export approval for use without restrictions 
based on the caller (for example, IPsec)? [Yes/No] \fBNo\fR

If you have non-retail export approval for unrestricted use of your
provider by callers, are you also planning to receive retail 
approval by restricting which export sensitive callers 
(for example, IPsec) may use your provider? [Yes/No] \fBNo\fR
