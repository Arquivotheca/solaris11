.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf

     [\fIterminal-name\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlastcomm\fR command gives information on previously executed commands. \fBlastcomm\fR with no arguments displays information about all the commands recorded during the current accounting file's lifetime. If called with arguments, \fBlastcomm\fR only displays accounting entries with a matching \fIcommand-name\fR, \fIuser-name\fR, or \fIterminal-name\fR. If extended process accounting is active (see \fBacctadm\fR(1M)) and is recording the appropriate data items, \fBlastcomm\fR attempts to take data from the current extended process accounting file. If standard process accounting is active, \fBlastcomm\fR takes data from the current standard accounting file (see \fBacct\fR(2)).
.sp
.LP
If \fIterminal-name\fR is `\fB- -\fR', there was no controlling \fBTTY\fR for the process. The process was probably executed during boot time. If  \fIterminal-name\fR is `\fB??\fR', the controlling \fBTTY\fR could not be decoded into a printable name.
.sp
.LP
For each process entry, \fBlastcomm\fR displays the following items of information:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The command name under which the process was called.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Uses \fIfile\fR as the source of accounting data. \fIfile\fR may be either an extended process accounting file or a standard process accounting file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Uses the currently active extended process accounting file. If extended processing accounting is inactive, no output will be produced.
