.SH NAME
setlabel \- move files to zone with corresponding sensitivity label
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/setlabel\fR \fInewlabel\fR \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsetlabel\fR moves files into the zone whose label corresponds to \fInewlabel\fR. The old file pathname is adjusted so that it is relative to the root pathname of the new zone. If the old pathname for a file's parent directory does not exist as a directory in the new zone, the file is not moved. Once moved, the file might no longer be accessible in the current zone.
.sp
.LP
Unless \fInewlabel\fR and \fIfilename\fR have been specified, no labels are set.
.sp
.LP
Labels are defined by the security administrator at your site. The system always displays labels in uppercase. Users can enter labels in any combination of uppercase and lowercase. Incremental changes to labels are supported.
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBsetflabel\fR(3TSOL) for a complete description of the conditions that are required to satisfy this command, and the privileges that are needed to execute this command.

.nf
% \fBsetlabel SECRET \fIsomefile\fR\fR
% \fBsetlabel "TOP SECRET" \fIsomefile\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Use any combination of upper and lowercase letters. You can separate items in a label with blanks, tabs, commas or slashes (\fB/\fR). Do not use any other punctuation.
.sp

.nf
% \fBsetlabel "ts a b" \fIsomefile\fR\fR
% \fBsetlabel "ts,a,b" \fIsomefile\fR\fR

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSet a Label.
.sp
.LP
To set \fIsomefile\fR's label to \fBSECRET A\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsetlabel "Secret a" \fIsomefile\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRTurn On a Compartment.
.sp
.LP
Plus and minus signs can be used to modify an existing label. A plus sign turns on the specified compartment for \fIsomefile\fR's label.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsetlabel +b \fIsomefile\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRTurn Off a Compartment.
.sp
.LP
A minus sign turns off the compartments that are associated with a classification. To turn off compartment \fBA\fR in \fIsomefile\fR's label:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsetlabel -A \fIsomefile\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If an incremental change is being made to an existing label and the first character of the label is a hyphen (\fB\(mi\fR), a preceding double-hyphen (\fB--\fR) is required.

.sp
.LP
To turn off compartment \fB-A\fR in \fIsomefile\fR's label:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsetlabel -- -A \fIsomefile\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
