.SH NAME
calendar \- reminder service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcalendar\fR [\fB-\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcalendar\fR utility consults the file \fBcalendar\fR in the current directory and writes lines that contain today's or tomorrow's date anywhere in the line to standard output. Most reasonable month-day dates such as \fBAug. 24\fR, \fBaugust 24\fR, \fB8/24\fR, and so forth, are recognized, but not \fB24 August\fR or \fB24/8\fR. On Fridays and weekends "tomorrow" extends through Monday. \fBcalendar\fR can be invoked regularly by using the \fBcrontab\fR(1) or \fBat\fR(1) commands.
.sp
.LP
When the optional argument \fB-\fR is present, \fBcalendar\fR does its job for every user who has a file \fBcalendar\fR in his or her login directory and sends them any positive results by \fBmail\fR(1). Normally this is done daily by facilities in the UNIX operating system (see\fBcron\fR(1M)).
.sp
.LP
If the environment variable \fBDATEMSK\fR is set, \fBcalendar\fR will use its value as the full path name of a template file containing format strings. The strings consist of conversion specifications and text characters and are used to provide a richer set of allowable date formats in different languages by appropriate settings of the environment variable \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_TIME\fR; see \fBenviron\fR(5). See\fBstrftime\fR(3C) for the list of allowable conversion specifications.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRPossible contents of a template
.sp
.LP
The following example shows the possible contents of a template:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
%B %eth of the year %Y
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fB%B\fR represents the full month name, \fB%e\fR the day of month and \fB%Y\fR the year (4 digits).

.sp
.LP
If \fBDATEMSK\fR is set to this template, the following \fBcalendar\fR file would be valid:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
March 7th of the year 1989 <Reminder>
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBcalendar\fR: \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_TIME\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBNLSPATH\fR, and \fBTZ\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Appropriate lines beginning with white space will not be printed.
.sp
.LP
Your calendar must be public information for you to get reminder service.
.sp
.LP
\fBcalendar\fR's extended idea of ``tomorrow'' does not account for holidays.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-\fR argument works only on calendar files that are local to the machine; \fBcalendar\fR is intended not to work on calendar files that are mounted remotely with \fBNFS.\fR Thus, `\fBcalendar \fR\fB-\fR' should be run only on diskful machines where home directories exist;  running it on a diskless client has no effect.
.sp
.LP
\fBcalendar\fR is no longer in the default root crontab. Because of the network burden `\fBcalendar \fR\fB-\fR' can induce, it is inadvisable in an environment running \fBypbind\fR(1M) with a large passwd.byname map.  If, however, the usefulness of \fBcalendar\fR outweighs the network impact, the super-user may run `\fBcrontab\fR \fB-e\fR' to edit the root crontab. Otherwise, individual users may wish to use `\fBcrontab\fR \fB-e\fR' to edit their own crontabs to have \fBcron\fR invoke \fBcalendar\fR without the \fB-\fR argument, piping output to mail addressed to themselves.
