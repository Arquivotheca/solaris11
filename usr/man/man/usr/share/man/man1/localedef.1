.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlocaledef\fR utility converts source definitions for locale categories into a format usable by the functions and utilities whose operational behavior is determined by the setting of the locale environment variables; see \fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The utility reads source definitions for one or more locale categories belonging to the same locale from the file named in the \fB-i\fR option (if specified) or from standard input.
.sp
.LP
Each category source definition is identified by the corresponding environment variable name and terminated by an \fBEND\fR \fIcategory-name\fR statement. The following categories are supported.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Creates permanent output even if warning messages have been issued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fIcompiler_options\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Passes the \fIcompiler_options\fR to the C compiler (\fBcc\fR). If more than one option is specified, then the options must be enclosed in quotes (\fB"\|"\fR).

.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIcharmap\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Specifies the pathname of a file containing a mapping of character symbols and collating element symbols to actual character encodings. This option must be specified if symbolic names (other than collating symbols defined in a \fBcollating-symbol\fR keyword) are used. If the \fB-f\fR option is not present, the default character mapping will be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIsourcefile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
The path name of a file containing the source definitions. If this option is not present, source definitions will be read from standard input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR \fIlinker_options\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Passes the \fIlinker_options\fR to the C compiler (\fBcc\fR) that follows the C source filename. If more than one option is specified, then the options must be enclosed in quotes (\fB"\|"\fR).
.sp
This is an old option. Use the \fB-W\fR \fBcc\fR,\fIarg\fR option instead.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImodel\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Specifies whether \fBlocaledef\fR will generate a 64-bit or a 32-bit locale object.
.sp
Specify \fImodel\fR as \fBilp32\fR to generate a 32-bit locale object. Specify \fBlp64\fR to generate a 64-bit locale object. If the \fB-m\fR option is not specified, \fBlocaledef\fR generates a 32-bit locale object. And if no other options than \fB-c\fR, \fB-f\fR, and \fB-i\fR options are specified and if the system running \fBlocaledef\fR supports the 64-bit environment, \fBlocaledef\fR additionally generates a 64-bit locale object.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIcode_set_name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Specifies the name of a codeset used as the target mapping of character symbols and collating element symbols whose encoding values are defined in terms of the ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard position constant values. See NOTES.
.RE

.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-W\fR \fBcc\fR,\fIarg\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
.rt  
Passes \fIarg\fR options to the C compiler. Each argument must be separated from the preceding by only a comma. A comma can be part of an argument by escaping it withan immediately preceding backslash character; the backslash is removed from the resulting argument.
.sp
Use this option instead of the \fB-C\fR and \fB-L\fR options.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fIextensions_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n

.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIlocalename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Identifies the locale. If the name contains one or more slash characters, \fIlocalename\fR will be interpreted as a path name where the created locale definitions will be stored. This capability may be restricted to users with appropriate privileges. (As a consequence of specifying one \fIlocalename\fR, although several categories can be processed in one execution, only categories belonging to the same locale can be processed.)
.RE

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
.LP
\fBlocaledef\fR creates a temporary C source file that represents the locale's data. \fBlocaledef\fR then calls the C compiler to compile this C source file into a shared object. 
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR \fBilp32\fR option is specified, \fBlocaledef\fR calls the C compiler for generating 32-bit objects and generates a 32-bit locale object. If the \fB-m\fR \fBlp64\fR option is specified, \fBlocaledef\fR calls the C compiler for generating 64-bit objects and generates a 64-bit locale object.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR option is not specified, \fBlocaledef\fR calls the C compiler for generating 32-bit objects and generates a 32-bit locale object. If no other options than \fB-c\fR, \fB-f\fR, and \fB-i\fR options are specified and if the system running \fBlocaledef\fR supports the 64-bit environment, \fBlocaledef\fR additionally calls the C compiler for generating 64-bit objects and generates a 64-bit locale object.
.sp
.LP
If no option to the C compiler is explicitly specified using the \fB-W\fR, \fB-C\fR, or \fB-L\fR options, \fBlocaledef\fR calls the C compiler with appropriate C compiler options to generate a locale object or objects.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR \fBilp32\fR option is specified, \fBlocaledef\fR generates a 32-bit locale object named:
.sp
.LP
\fIlocalename\fR.so.\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR \fBlp64\fR option is specified, \fBlocaledef\fR generates a 64-bit locale object named:
.sp
.LP
\fIlocalename\fR.so.\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-m\fR option is not specified, \fBlocaledef\fR generates a 32-bit locale object named:
.sp
.LP
\fIlocalename\fR.so.\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
and, if appropriate, generates a 64-bit locale object named: 
.sp
.LP
\fI64-bit_architecture_name\fR/\fIlocalename\fR.so.\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
The shared object for the 32-bit environment must be moved to:
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocalename\fR\fB/\fR\fIlocalename\fR\fB\&.so.\fR\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
The shared object for the 64-bit environment on SPARC must be moved to:
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocalename\fR\fB/sparcv9/\fR\fIlocalename\fR\fB\&.so.\fR\fIversion_number\fR
.sp
.LP
The shared object for the 64-bit environment on AMD64 must be moved to:
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/lib/locale/\fI<localename>\fR/amd64/\fI<localename>\fR\&.so.\fI<version_number>\fR\fR
.sp
.LP
\fBlocaledef\fR also generates a text file named \fIlocalename\fR that is used for information only.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for definitions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBlocaledef\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.

If warnings occur, permanent output will be created if the \fB-c\fR option was specified. The following conditions will cause warning messages to be issued:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
When the \fB-u\fR option is used, the \fIcode_set_name\fR option-argument is interpreted as a name of a codeset to which the ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard position constant values are converted. Both the ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard position constant values and other formats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) are valid as encoding values within the charmap file. The codeset can be any codeset that is supported by the \fBiconv_open\fR(3C) function on the system.
.sp
.LP
When conflicts occur between the charmap specification of \fIcode_set_name\fR, \fImb_cur_max\fR, or \fImb_cur_min\fR and the 	corresponding value for the codeset represented by the \fB-u\fR option-argument \fIcode_set_name\fR, the \fBlocaledef\fR utility fails as an 	error.
.sp
.LP
When conflicts occur between the charmap encoding values specified for symbolic names of characters of the portable character set and the character encoding values defined by the US-ASCII, the result is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
If a non-printable character in the charmap has a width specified that is not \fB-1\fR, \fBlocaledef\fR generates a warning.
