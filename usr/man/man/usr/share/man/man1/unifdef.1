.SH NAME
unifdef \- resolve and remove ifdef'ed lines from C program source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBunifdef\fR [\fB-clt\fR] [\fB-D\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB-U\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB-iD\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB-iU\fR\fIname\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBunifdef\fR removes \fBifdef\fRed lines from a file while otherwise leaving the file alone. It is smart enough to deal with the nested \fBifdef\fRs, comments, single and double quotes of C syntax, but it does not do any including or interpretation of macros. Neither does it strip out comments, though it recognizes and ignores them. You specify which symbols you want defined with \fB-D\fR options, and which you want undefined with \fB-U\fR options. Lines within those \fBifdef\fRs will be copied to the output, or removed, as appropriate. Any \fBifdef\fR, \fBifndef\fR, \fBelse\fR, and \fBendif\fR lines associated with \fIfilename\fR will also be removed.
.sp
.LP
\fBifdef\fRs involving symbols you do not specify are untouched and copied out along with their associated \fBifdef\fR, \fBelse\fR, and \fBendiff1\fR lines.
.sp
.LP
If an \fBifdef\fR\fIX\fR occurs nested inside another \fBifdef\fR\fIX\fR, then the inside \fBifdef\fR is treated as if it were an unrecognized symbol. If the same symbol appears in more than one argument, only the first occurrence is significant.
.sp
.LP
\fBunifdef\fR copies its output to the standard output and will take its input from the standard input if no \fIfilename\fR argument is given.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Complement the normal operation. Lines that would have been removed or blanked are retained, and vice versa.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Replace ``lines removed'' lines with blank lines.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Plain text option. \fBunifdef\fR refrains from attempting to recognize comments and single and double quotes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lines associated with the defined symbol \fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Lines associated with the undefined symbol \fIname\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-iD\fR\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Ignore, but print out, lines associated with the defined symbol \fIname\fR. If you use \fBifdef\fRs to delimit non-C lines, such as comments or code which is under construction, then you must tell \fBunifdef\fR which symbols are used for that purpose so that it will not try to parse for quotes and comments within them.
.RE
