.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "\fBsh\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBbreak\fR utility exits from the enclosing \fBfor\fR or \fBwhile\fR loop, if any. If \fIn\fR is specified, break \fIn\fR levels.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcontinue\fR utility resumes the next iteration of the enclosing \fBfor\fR or \fBwhile\fR loop. If \fIn\fR is specified, resume at the \fIn\fR-th enclosing loop.
.SS "\fBcsh\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBbreak\fR utility resumes execution after the \fBend\fR of the nearest enclosing \fBforeach\fR or \fBwhile\fR loop. The remaining commands on the current line are executed. This allows multilevel breaks to be written as a list of \fBbreak\fR commands, all on one line.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcontinue\fR utility continues execution of the next iteration of the nearest enclosing \fBwhile\fR or \fBforeach\fR loop.
.SS "\fBksh88\fR"
.sp
.LP
The \fBbreak\fR utility exits from the enclosed \fBfor\fR, \fBwhile\fR, \fBuntil\fR, or \fBselect\fR loop, if any. If \fIn\fR is specified, then \fBbreak\fR \fIn\fR levels. If \fIn\fR is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be exited.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcontinue\fR utility resumes the next iteration of the enclosed \fBfor\fR, \fBwhile\fR, \fBuntil\fR, or \fBselect\fR loop. If \fIn\fR is specified then resume at the \fIn\fR-th enclosed loop. If \fIn\fR is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be used.

Words that follow a command preceded by \fB**\fR that are in the format of a variable assignment are expanded with the same rules as a variable assignment. This means that tilde substitution is performed after the \fB=\fR sign, and also that word splitting and file name generation are not performed.

.LP
\fBbreak\fR is a shell special built-in that exits the smallest enclosing \fBfor\fR, \fBselect\fR, \fBwhile\fR, or \fBuntil\fR loop. It also exits the \fIn\fRth enclosing loop if \fIn\fR is specified. Execution continues at the command following the loop or loops.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified, it must be a positive integer \fB\(>=1\fR\&. If \fIn\fR is larger than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop is exited. 
.sp
.LP
\fBcontinue\fR is a shell special built-in that continues execution at the top of the smallest enclosing \fBfor\fR, \fBselect\fR, \fBwhile\fR, or \fBuntil\fR loop, if any; or of the top of the \fIn\fRth enclosing loop if n is specified. 
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified, it must be a positive integer \fB\(>=1\fR\&. If \fIn\fR is larger than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop is used.
