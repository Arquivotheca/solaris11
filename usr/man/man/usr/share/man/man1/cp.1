.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In the first synopsis form, neither \fIsource_file\fR nor \fItarget_file\fR are directory files, nor can they have the same name. The \fBcp\fR utility copies the contents of \fIsource_file\fR to the destination path named by \fItarget_file\fR. If \fItarget_file\fR exists, \fBcp\fR overwrites its contents, but the mode (and \fBACL\fR if applicable), owner, and group associated with it are not changed. The last modification time of \fItarget_file\fR and the last access time of \fIsource_file\fR are set to the time the copy was made. If \fItarget_file\fR does not exist, \fBcp\fR creates a new file named \fItarget_file\fR that has the same mode as \fIsource_file\fR except that the sticky bit is not set unless the user is super-user. In this case, the owner and group of \fItarget_file\fR are those of the user, unless the setgid bit is set on the directory containing the newly created file. If the directory's setgid bit is set, the newly created file has the group of the containing directory rather than of the creating user. If \fItarget_file\fR is a link to another file, \fBcp\fR overwrites the link destination with the contents of \fIsource_file\fR; the link(s) from \fItarget_file\fR remains.
.sp
.LP
In the second synopsis form, one or more \fIsource_file\fRs are copied to the directory specified by \fItarget\fR. It is an error if any \fIsource_file\fR is a file of type directory, if \fItarget\fR either does not exist or is not a directory.
.sp
.LP
In the third or fourth synopsis forms, one or more directories specified by \fIsource_dir\fR are copied to the directory specified by \fItarget\fR. Either the \fB-r\fR or \fB-R\fR must be specified. For each \fIsource_dir\fR, \fBcp\fR copies all files and subdirectories.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for both \fB/usr/bin/cp\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/cp\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Unlink. If a file descriptor for a destination file cannot be obtained, this option attempts to unlink the destination file and proceed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Takes actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand.
.sp
If the \fIsource_file\fR operand is a symbolic link, then \fBcp\fR copies the file referenced by the symbolic link for the \fIsource_file\fR operand. All other symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy are preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Interactive. \fBcp\fR prompts for confirmation whenever the copy would overwrite an existing target. This is done regardless of whether the input is coming from a terminal. If the prompt for confirmation fails, it is equivalent to the user answering in the negative. An affirmative response means that the copy should proceed. Any other answer prevents \fBcp\fR from overwriting \fItarget\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Takes actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand or any symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.
.sp
Copies files referenced by symbolic links. Symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy are not preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Preserve. The \fBcp\fR utility duplicates not only the contents of \fIsource_file\fR, but also attempts to preserve its ACL, access and modification times, extended attributes, extended system attributes, file mode, and owner and group ids. 
.sp
If \fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the access and modification times, extended attributes, or the file mode, \fBcp\fR does not consider it a failure. If \fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the owner and group id, the copy does not fail, but \fBcp\fR silently clears the \fBS_ISUID\fR and \fBS_ISGID\fR bits from the file mode of the target. The copy fails if \fBcp\fR is unable to clear these bits. If \fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the ACL or extended system attributes, the copy fails. If the copy fails, then a diagnostic message is written to \fBstderr\fR and (after processing any remaining operands) \fBcp\fR exits with a \fBnon-zero\fR exit status. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Takes actions on any symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand or any symbolic link encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.
.sp
Copies symbolic links. Symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy are preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Recursive. \fBcp\fR copies the directory and all its files, including any subdirectories and their files to \fItarget\fR. Unless the \fB-H\fR, \fB-L\fR, or \fB-P\fR option is specified, the \fB-L\fR option is used as the default mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-R\fR\fR

\fB\fB-@\fR\fR

Preserves extended attributes. \fBcp\fR attempts to copy all of the source file's extended attributes along with the file data to the destination file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-/\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Preserves extended attributes and extended system attributes. Along with the file's data, the \fBcp\fR utility attempts to copy extended attributes and extended system attributes from each source file, and extended system attributes associated with extended attributes to the destination file. If \fBcp\fR is unable to copy extended attributes or extended system attributes, then a diagnostic message is written to \fBstderr\fR and (after processing any remaining operands) exits with a \fBnon-zero\fR exit status. 
.RE

.sp
.LP
Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options \fB-H\fR, \fB-L\fR, and \fB-P\fR is not considered an error. The last option specified determines the behavior of the utility.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBcp\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.LP
Affirmative responses are processed using the extended regular expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR keyword in the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category of the user's locale. The locale specified in the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category defines the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the expression defined for \fByesexpr\fR. The locale specified in \fBLC_CTYPE\fR determines the locale for interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data a characters, the behavior of character classes used in the expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR. See \fBlocale\fR(5).

The permission modes of the source file are preserved in the copy.

.LP
A \fB--\fR permits the user to mark the end of any command line options explicitly, thus allowing \fBcp\fR to recognize filename arguments that begin with a \fB-\fR.
