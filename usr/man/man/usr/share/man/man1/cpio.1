.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcpio\fR command copies files into and out of a \fBcpio\fR archive. The \fBcpio\fR archive can span multiple volumes. The \fB-i\fR, \fB-o\fR, and \fB-p\fR options select the action to be performed. The following list describes each of the actions. These actions are mutually exclusive.
.SS "Copy In Mode"
.sp
.LP
\fBcpio\fR \fB-i\fR (copy in) extracts files from the standard input, which is assumed to be the product of a previous \fBcpio\fR \fB-o\fR command. Only files with names that match one of the \fIpattern\fRs are selected. See \fBsh\fR(1) and OPERANDS for more information about \fIpattern\fR. Extracted files are conditionally copied into the current directory tree, based on the options described below. The permissions of the files are those of the previous \fBcpio -o\fR command. The owner and group are the same as the current user, unless the current user has the \fB{PRIV_FILE_CHOWN_SELF}\fR privilege. See \fBchown\fR(2). If this is the case, owner and group are the same as those resulting from the previous \fBcpio -o\fR command. Notice that if \fBcpio\fR \fB-i\fR tries to create a file that already exists and the existing file is the same age or younger (\fBnewer\fR), \fBcpio\fR outputs a warning message and not replace the file. The \fB-u\fR option can be used to unconditionally overwrite the existing file.
.SS "Copy Out Mode"
.sp
.LP
\fBcpio\fR \fB-o\fR (copy out) reads a list of file path names from the standard input and copies those files to the standard output, together with path name and status information in the form of a \fBcpio\fR archive. Output is padded to an 8192-byte boundary by default or to the user-specified block size (with the \fB-B\fR or \fB-C\fR options) or to some device-dependent block size where necessary (as with the CTC tape).
.SS "Pass Mode"
.sp
.LP
\fBcpio\fR \fB-p\fR (pass) reads a list of file path names from the standard input and conditionally copies those files into the destination directory tree, based on the options described below.
.sp
.LP
If the underlying file system of the source file supports detection of holes as reported by \fBpathconf\fR(2), the file is a sparse file, and the destination file is seekable, then holes in sparse files are preserved in pass mode, otherwise holes are filled with zeros.
.sp
.LP
\fBcpio\fR assumes four-byte words.
.sp
.LP
If, when writing to a character device (\fB-o\fR) or reading from a character device (\fB-i\fR), \fBcpio\fR reaches the end of a medium, and the \fB-O\fR and \fB-I\fR options are not used, \fBcpio\fR prints the following message:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
To continue, type device/file name when ready.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To continue, you must replace the medium and type the character special device name and press RETURN.

\fB\fB-0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Reads a list of filenames terminated by a null character, instead of a NEWLINE, so that files whose names contain NEWLINESs can be archived. Using \fBfind\fR with the\fB-print0\fR option is one way to produce such a list of filenames. 
.sp
This option may be used in copy-out and copy-pass modes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Resets access times of input files after they have been copied, making \fBcpio\fR's access invisible. Access times are not reset for linked files when \fBcpio\fR \fB-pla\fR is specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Appends files to an archive. The \fB-A\fR option requires the \fB-O\fR option. Valid only with archives that are files or that are on hard disk partitions. The effect on files that are linked in the existing portion of the archive is unpredictable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-B\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Blocks input/output 5120 bytes to the record. The default buffer size is 8192 bytes when this and the \fB-C\fR options are not used. \fB-B\fR does not apply to the \fB-p\fR (pass) option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Reads or writes header information in \fBASCII\fR character form for portability. There are no \fBUID\fR or \fBGID\fR restrictions associated with this header format. Use this option between SVR4-based machines, or the \fB-H\fR \fBodc\fR option between unknown machines. The \fB-c\fR option implies the use of expanded device numbers, which are only supported on SVR4-based systems. When transferring files between SunOS 4 or Interactive UNIX and the Solaris 2.6 Operating environment or compatible versions, use \fB-H\fR \fBodc\fR.

.rt  
\fBASCII\fR header with small device numbers. This is the IEEE/P1003 Data Interchange Standard cpio header and format. It has the widest range of portability of any of the header formats. It is the official format for transferring files between POSIX-conforming systems (see \fBstandards\fR(5)). Use this format to communicate with SunOS 4 and Interactive UNIX. This header format allows \fBUID\fRs and \fBGID\fRs up to 262143 to be stored in the header.

Reads the contents of \fIfile\fR as an input archive, instead of the standard input. If \fIfile\fR is a character special device, and the current medium has been completely read, replace the medium and press RETURN to continue to the next medium. This option is used only with the \fB-i\fR option.

.RS 14n
.rt  
Attempts to skip corrupted file headers and I/O errors that might be encountered. If you want to copy files from a medium that is corrupted or out of sequence, this option lets you read only those files with good headers. For \fBcpio\fR archives that contain other \fBcpio\fR archives, if an error is encountered, \fBcpio\fR can terminate prematurely. \fBcpio\fR finds the next good header, which can be one for a smaller archive, and terminate when the smaller archive's trailer is encountered.

If the option is used for input, existing \fBACL\fRs are extracted along with other attributes from standard input. The option recognizes the special file type. Notice that errors occurs if a \fBcpio\fR archive with \fBACL\fRs is extracted by previous versions of \fBcpio\fR. This option should not be used with the \fB-c\fR option, as \fBACL\fR support might not be present on all systems, and hence is not portable. Use \fBASCII\fR headers for portability.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBcpio\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The following examples show three uses of \fBcpio\fR.
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing standard input
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBls | cpio -oc > ../newfile\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When standard input is directed through a pipe to \fBcpio\fR \fB-o\fR, as in the example above, it groups the files so they can be directed (>) to a single file (\fB\&../newfile\fR). The \fB-c\fR option insures that the file is portable to other machines (as would the \fB-H\fR option). Instead of \fBls\fR(1), you could use \fBfind\fR(1), \fBecho\fR(1), \fBcat\fR(1), and so on, to pipe a list of names to \fBcpio\fR. You could direct the output to a device instead of a file.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRExtracting files into directories
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat newfile | cpio -icd "memo/a1" "memo/b*"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this example, \fBcpio\fR \fB-i\fR uses the output file of \fBcpio\fR \fB-o\fR (directed through a pipe with \fBcat\fR), extracts those files that match the patterns (\fBmemo/a1\fR, \fBmemo/b*\fR), creates directories below the current directory as needed (\fB-d\fR option), and places the files in the appropriate directories. The \fB-c\fR option is used if the input file was created with a portable header. If no patterns were given, all files from \fBnewfile\fR would be placed in the directory.

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRCopying or linking files to another directory
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBfind . -depth -print | cpio -pdlmv newdir\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In this example, \fBcpio\fR \fB-p\fR takes the file names piped to it and copies or links (\fB-l\fR option) those files to another directory, \fBnewdir\fR. The \fB-d\fR option says to create directories as needed. The \fB-m\fR option says to retain the modification time. (It is important to use the \fB-depth\fR option of \fBfind\fR(1) to generate path names for \fBcpio\fR. This eliminates problems that \fBcpio\fR could have trying to create files under read-only directories.) The destination directory, \fBnewdir\fR, must exist.

.sp
.LP
Notice that when you use \fBcpio\fR in conjunction with \fBfind\fR, if you use the \fB-L\fR option with \fBcpio\fR, you must use the \fB-follow\fR option with \fBfind\fR and vice versa. Otherwise, there are undesirable results.
.sp
.LP
For multi-reel archives, dismount the old volume, mount the new one, and continue to the next tape by typing the name of the next device (probably the same as the first reel). To stop, type a RETURN and \fBcpio\fR ends.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

When the command line options "\fB-o\fR \fB-H\fR \fBtar\fR" are specified, the archive created is of type \fBUSTAR\fR. This means that it is an error to read this same archive using the command line options "\fB-i\fR \fB-H\fR \fBtar\fR". The archive should be read using the command line options "\fB-i\fR \fB-H\fR \fBustar\fR". The options "\fB-i\fR \fB-H\fR \fBtar\fR" refer to an older tar archive format.

An error message is output for files whose \fBUID\fR or \fBGID\fR are too large to fit in the selected header format. Use \fB-H\fR \fBcrc\fR or \fB-c\fR to create archives that allow all \fBUID\fR or \fBGID\fR values.

If a file has \fB000\fR permissions, contains more than 0 characters of data, and the user is not root, the file is not saved or restored.

When cpio is invoked in \fBCopy In\fR or \fBPass Mode\fR by a user with \fB{PRIV_FILE_CHOWN_SELF}\fR privilege, and in particular on a system where \fB{_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED}\fR is not in effect (effectively granting this privilege to all users where not overridden), extracted or copied files can end up with owners and groups determined by those of the original archived files, which can differ from the invoking user's. This might not be what the user intended. The \fB-R\fR option can be used to retain file ownership, if desired, if you specify the user's id.

The inode number stored in the header (\fB/usr/include/archives.h\fR) is an unsigned short, which is 2 bytes. This limits the range of inode numbers from \fB0\fR to \fB65535\fR. Files which are hard linked must fall in this inode range. This could be a problem when moving \fBcpio\fR archives between different vendors' machines.

You must use the same blocking factor when you retrieve or copy files from the tape to the hard disk as you did when you copied files from the hard disk to the tape. Therefore, you must specify the \fB-B\fR or \fB-C\fR option.

During \fB-p\fR and \fB-o\fR processing, \fBcpio\fR buffers the file list presented on stdin in a temporary file.

.LP
The new \fBpax\fR(1) format, with a command that supports it (for example, \fBtar\fR), should be used for large files. The \fBcpio\fR command is no longer part of the current POSIX standard and is deprecated in favor of \fBpax\fR.
