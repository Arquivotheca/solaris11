.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The mail utilities listed above provide a comfortable, flexible environment for sending and receiving mail messages electronically.
.sp
.LP
When reading mail, the mail utilities provide commands to facilitate saving, deleting, and responding to messages. When sending mail, the mail utilities allow editing, reviewing and other modification of the message as it is entered.
.sp
.LP
Incoming mail is stored in a standard file for each user, called the \fBmailbox\fR for that user. When the mail utilities are called to read messages, the \fBmailbox\fR is the default place to find them. As messages are read, they are marked to be moved to a secondary file for storage, unless specific action is taken, so that the messages need not be seen again.This secondary file is called the \fBmbox\fR and is normally located in the user's \fBHOME\fR directory (see \fBMBOX\fR in ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES for a description of this file). Messages can be saved in other secondary files named by the user. Messages remain in a secondary file until forcibly removed.
.sp
.LP
The user can access a secondary file by using the \fB-f\fR option. Messages in the secondary file can then be read or otherwise processed using the same \fBCommands\fR as in the primary \fBmailbox\fR. This gives rise within these pages to the notion of a current \fBmailbox\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
On the command line options start with a dash (\(mi). Any other arguments are taken to be destinations (recipients). If no recipients are specified, \fBmailx\fR attempts to read messages from the \fBmailbox\fR.

.SH USAGE
.SS "Starting Mail"
.sp
.LP
At startup time, \fBmailx\fR executes the system startup file \fB/etc/mail/mailx.rc\fR. If invoked as \fBmail\fR or \fBMail\fR, the system startup file \fB/etc/mail/Mail.rc\fR is used instead.
.sp
.LP
The system startup file sets  up initial display options and alias lists and assigns values to some internal variables. These variables are flags and valued parameters which are set and cleared using the \fBse\fRt and \fBuns\fRet commands. See \fBInternal Variables\fR.
.sp
.LP
With the following exceptions, regular commands are legal inside startup files: \fB!\fR, \fBC\fRopy, \fBe\fRdit, \fBfo\fRllowup, \fBF\fRollowup, \fBho\fRld, \fBm\fRail, \fBpre\fRserve, \fBr\fReply, \fBR\fReply, \fBsh\fRell, and \fBv\fRisual. An error in the startup file causes the remaining lines in the file to be ignored.
.sp
.LP
After executing the system startup file,  the mail utilities execute the optional personal startup file \fB$HOME/.mailrc\fR, wherein the user can override the values of the internal variables as set by the system startup file.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-n\fR option is specified, however, the mail utilities do not execute the system startup file.
.sp
.LP
Many system administrators include the commands
.sp
.in +2
.nf
set appenddeadletter
unset replyall
unset pipeignore
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
in the system startup files (to be compatible with past Solaris behavior), but this does not meet standards requirements for \fBmailx\fR. To get standard behavior for \fBmailx\fR, users should use the \fB-n\fR option or include the following commands in a personal startup file:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
unset appenddeadletter
set replyall
set pipeignore
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When reading mail, the mail utilities are in \fIcommand mode\fR. A header summary of the first several messages is displayed, followed by a prompt indicating the mail utilities can accept regular commands (see \fBCommands\fR below). When sending mail, the mail utilities are in \fIinput mode\fR. If no subject is specified on the command line, and the \fBasksub\fR variable is set, a prompt for the subject is printed.
.sp
.LP
As the message is typed, the mail utilities read the message and store it in a temporary file. Commands may be entered by beginning a line with the tilde (~) escape character followed by a single command letter and optional arguments. See \fBTilde Escapes\fR for a summary of these commands.
.SS "Reading Mail"
.sp
.LP
Each message is assigned a sequential number, and there is at any time the notion of a current message, marked by a right angle bracket (>) in the header summary. Many commands take an optional list of messages (\fImessage-list\fR) to operate on.  In most cases, the current message is set to the highest-numbered message in the list after the command is finished executing.
.sp
.LP
The default for \fImessage-list\fR is the current message. A \fImessage-list\fR is a list of message identifiers separated by spaces, which may include:

Other arguments are usually arbitrary strings whose usage depends on the command involved. Filenames, where expected, are expanded using the normal shell conventions (see \fBsh\fR(1)). Special characters are recognized by certain commands and are documented with the commands below.
.SS "Sending Mail"
.sp
.LP
Recipients listed on the command line may be of three types: login names, shell commands, or alias groups. Login names may be any network address, including mixed network addressing. If mail is found to be undeliverable, an attempt is made to return it to the sender's \fBmailbox\fR. If the recipient name begins with a pipe symbol ( | ), the rest of the name is taken to be a shell command to pipe the message through. This provides an automatic interface with any program that reads the standard input. Groups are set by the \fBa\fRlias command (see \fBCommands\fR below) or in a system startup file (for example, \fB$HOME/.mailrc\fR). Aliases are lists of recipients of any type.
.SS "Forwarding Mail"
.sp
.LP
To forward a specific message, include it in a message to the desired recipients with the \fB~f\fR or \fB~m\fR tilde escapes. See \fBTilde\fR \fBEscapes\fR below. To forward mail automatically, add a comma-separated list of addresses for additional recipients to the \fB\&.forward\fR file in your home directory. This is different from the format of the \fBalias\fR command, which takes a space-separated list instead. \fBNote:\fR Forwarding addresses must be valid, or the messages will "bounce." You cannot, for instance, reroute your mail to a new host by forwarding it to your new address if it is not yet listed in the \fBNIS\fR aliases domain.
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
Regular commands are of the form
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[ \fIcommand\fR ] [ \fImessage-list\fR ] [ \fIarguments\fR ]
.fi

.sp

.sp
.LP
In \fIinput mode\fR, commands are recognized by the escape character, \fBtilde(~)\fR, and lines not treated as commands are taken as input for the message. If no command is specified in \fIcommand mode\fR, \fBn\fRext is assumed. The following is a complete list of \fBmailx\fR commands:
