.TH env 1 "12 Jul 2011" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
env \- set environment for command invocation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/env\fR [\fB-i\fR | \fB-\fR] [\fIname=value\fR]... [\fIutility\fR [\fIarg\fR... ]]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/xpg4/bin/env\fR [\fB-i\fR | \fB-\fR] [\fIname=value\fR]... 
     [\fIutility\fR [\fIarg\fR... ]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBenv\fR utility obtains the current environment, modifies it according to its arguments, then invokes the utility named by the \fIutility\fR operand with the modified environment.
.sp
.LP
Optional arguments are passed to \fIutility\fR. If no \fIutility\fR operand is specified, the resulting environment is written to the standard output, with one \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR pair per line.
.SS "\fB/usr/bin\fR"
.sp
.LP
If \fBenv\fR executes commands with arguments, it uses the default shell \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR (see \fBsh\fR(1)).
.SS "\fB/usr/xpg4/bin\fR"
.sp
.LP
If \fBenv\fR executes commands with arguments, it uses \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sh\fR (see \fBksh88\fR(1)).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR | \fB\(mi\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Ignores the environment that would otherwise be inherited from the current shell.  Restricts the environment for \fIutility\fR to that specified by the arguments.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Arguments of the form \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR modify the execution environment, and are placed into the inherited environment before \fIutility\fR is invoked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIutility\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The name of the utility to be invoked.  If \fIutility\fR names any of the special shell built-in utilities, the results are undefined.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIarg\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A string to pass as an argument for the invoked utility.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRInvoking utilities with new PATH values
.sp
.LP
The following utility:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBenv -i PATH=/mybin mygrep xyz myfile \fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
invokes the utility \fBmygrep\fR with a new \fBPATH\fR value as the only entry in its environment. In this case, \fBPATH\fR is used to locate \fBmygrep\fR, which then must reside in \fB/mybin\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBenv\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPATH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
Determine the location of the \fIutility\fR. If \fBPATH\fR is specified as a \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR operand to \fBenv\fR, the value given shall be used in the search for \fIutility\fR.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
If \fIutility\fR is invoked, the exit status of \fBenv\fR is the exit status of \fIutility\fR. Otherwise, the \fBenv\fR utility returns one of the following exit values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
