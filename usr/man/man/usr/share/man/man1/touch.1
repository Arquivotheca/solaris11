.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtouch\fR utility sets the access and modification times of each file. The \fIfile\fR operand is created if it does not already exist.
.sp
.LP
The time used can be specified by \fB-t\fR \fItime\fR, by \fB-d\fR \fIdate_time\fR, by the corresponding time fields of the file referenced by \fB-r\fR \fIref_file\fR, or by the \fItime_spec\fR operand. If none of these are specified, \fBtouch\fR uses the current time.
.sp
.LP
If neither the \fB-a\fR nor \fB-m\fR options are specified, \fBtouch\fR updates both the modification and access times.
.sp
.LP
A user with write access to a file, but who is not the owner of the file or a super-user, can change the modification and access times of that file only to the current time. Attempts to set a specific time with \fBtouch\fR results in an error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsettime\fR utility is equivalent to \fBtouch\fR \fB-c\fR [\fItime_spec\fR] \fIfile\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported in the \fBtouch\fR and \fBsettime\fR utilities:

where each two digits represent the following:

.RE

Both \fICC\fR and \fIYY\fR are optional. If neither is given, the current year is assumed. If \fIYY\fR is specified, but \fICC\fR is not, \fICC\fR is derived as follows:

_
69-9919
00-3820
39-68ERROR
.TE

The resulting time is affected by the value of the \fBTZ\fR environment variable. The range of valid times is the Epoch to January 18, 2038.
.sp
The range for \fISS\fR is [00-61] rather than [00-59] because of leap seconds. If \fISS\fR is 60 or 61, and the resulting time, as affected by the \fBTZ\fR environment variable, does not refer to a leap second, the resulting time is one or two seconds after a time where \fISS\fR is 59. If \fISS\fR is not given, it is assumed to be 0.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Users familiar with the BSD environment find that for the \fBtouch\fR utility, the \fB-f\fR option is accepted but ignored. The \fB-f\fR option is unnecessary because \fBtouch\fR succeeds for all files owned by the user regardless of the permissions on the files.
