.SH NAME
talk \- talk to another user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBtalk\fR \fIaddress\fR [\fIterminal\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtalk\fR utility is a two-way, screen-oriented communication program.
.sp
.LP
When first invoked, \fBtalk\fR sends a message similar to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Message from TalkDaemon@ \fIher_machine\fR at \fItime .\|.\|.\fR
talk: connection requested by \fIyour_address\fR
talk: respond with: talk \fIyour_address\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
to the specified \fIaddress\fR. At this point, the recipient of the message can reply by typing:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
talk \fIyour_address\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Once communication is established, the two parties can type simultaneously, with their output displayed in separate regions of the screen. Characters are processed as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the alert character will alert the recipient's terminal.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing Control-L will cause the sender's screen regions to be refreshed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the erase and kill characters will affect the sender's terminal in the manner described by the \fBtermios\fR(3C) interface.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the interrupt or end-of-file (\fBEOF\fR) characters will terminate the local \fBtalk\fR utility. Once the \fBtalk\fR session has been terminated on one side, the other side of the \fBtalk\fR session will be notified that the \fBtalk\fR session has been terminated and will be able to do nothing except exit.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing characters from \fBLC_CTYPE\fR classifications \fBprint\fR or \fBspace\fR will cause those characters to be sent to the recipient's terminal.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When and only when the \fBstty\fR \fBiexten\fR local mode is enabled, additional special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte characters are processed as printable characters if their wide character equivalents are printable.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing other non-printable characters will cause them to be written to the recipient's terminal as follows: control characters will appear as a caret (\|\fB^\fR\|) followed by the appropriate \fBASCII\fR character, and characters with the high-order bit set will appear in "meta" notation. For example, `\fB\e003\fR\&' is displayed as `\fB^C\fR' and `\fB\e372\fR\&' as `\fBM\(miz\fR'.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Permission to be a recipient of a \fBtalk\fR message can be denied or granted by use of the \fBmesg\fR(1) utility. However, a user's privilege may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users' terminals. Certain commands, such as \fBpr\fR(1), disallow messages in order to prevent interference with their output. \fBtalk\fR will fail when the user lacks the appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.
.sp
.LP
Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to support the simultaneous exchange of messages required for \fBtalk\fR. When this type of exchange cannot be supported on such terminals, the implementation may support an exchange with reduced levels of simultaneous interaction or it may report an error describing the terminal-related deficiency.
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The recipient of the \fBtalk\fR session. One form of \fIaddress\fR is the \fIusername\fR, as returned by the \fBwho\fR(1) utility. If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then \fIusername\fR is just the person's login name. If you wish to talk to a user on another host, then \fIusername\fR is one of the following forms: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIhost\fR\fB!\fR\fIuser\fR
\fIhost\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIuser\fR
\fIhost\fR\fB:\fR\fIuser\fR
\fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fIhost\fR 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

although \fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fIhost\fR is perhaps preferred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIterminal\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
If the recipient is logged in more than once, \fIterminal\fR can be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name. If \fIterminal\fR is not specified, the \fBtalk\fR message will be displayed on one or more accessible terminals in use by the recipient. The format of \fIterminal\fR will be the same as that returned by  \fBwho\fR.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBtalk\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
Determine the name of the invoker's terminal type.  If this variable is unset or null, an unspecified terminal type will be used.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
An error occurred, or \fBtalk\fR was invoked on a terminal incapable of supporting it.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Typing Control-L redraws the screen, while the erase, kill, and word kill characters will work in \fBtalk\fR as normal. To exit, type an interrupt character. \fBtalk\fR then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the terminal to its previous state.
