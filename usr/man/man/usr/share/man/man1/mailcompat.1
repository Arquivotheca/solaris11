.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmailcompat\fR is a program to provide SunOS 4.\fIx\fR compatability for the Solaris mailbox format. You would typically run  \fBmailcompat\fR to be able to read mail on a workstation running SunOS 4.\fIx\fR when your mail server is running Solaris.

Enabling \fBmailcompat\fR creates an entry in your  \fB\&.forward\fR file, if it exists.  If this file does not exist, \fBmailcompat\fR will create it.  Disabling \fBmailcompat\fR will remove the entry from the \fB\&.forward\fR file, and if this was the only entry, will remove the entire file.

To execute \fBmailcompat\fR, log onto the Solaris mail server and enter \fBmailcompat\fR on the command line. Answer the queries provided by the program.
