.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBxgettext\fR utility is used to automate the creation of portable message files (\fB\&.po\fR). A \fB\&.po\fR file contains copies of "C" strings that are found in  ANSI C source code in \fIfilename\fR or the standard input if  `\fB\(mi\fR\&' is specified on the command line. The  \fB\&.po\fR file can be used as input to the  \fBmsgfmt\fR(1) utility, which produces a binary form of the message file that can be  used by application during run-time.
.sp
.LP
\fBxgettext\fR writes \fImsgid\fR strings from \fBgettext\fR(3C) calls in  \fIfilename\fR to the default output file \fBmessages.po\fR. The default output file name can be changed by  \fB-d\fR option. \fImsgid\fR strings in \fBdgettext()\fR calls are written to the output file \fBdomainname\fR\fB\&.po\fR where \fBdomainname\fR is the first parameter to the \fBdgettext()\fR call.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBxgettext\fR creates a  \fB\&.po\fR file in the current working directory, and each entry is in the same order that the strings are extracted from \fIfilenames\fR. When the \fB-p\fR option is specified, the  \fB\&.po\fR file is created in the  \fIpathname\fR directory. An existing \fB\&.po\fR file is overwritten.
.sp
.LP
Duplicate  \fImsgid\fRs are written to the  \fB\&.po\fR file as comment lines. When the  \fB-s\fR option is specified, the  \fB\&.po\fR is sorted by the \fImsgid\fR string, and all duplicated \fImsgid\fRs are removed. All  \fImsgstr\fR directives in the \fB\&.po\fR file are empty unless the \fB-m\fR option is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Add comment lines to the output file indicating file name and line number in the source file where each extracted string is encountered. These lines appear before each \fImsgid\fR in the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# # File: \fIfilename\fR, line: \fIline-number\fR 
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-s\fR\fR

Generate output sorted by  \fImsgid\fRs with all duplicate  \fImsgid\fRs removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Extract all strings, not just those found in \fBgettext\fR(3C), and \fBdgettext()\fR () calls. Only one  \fB\&.po\fR file is created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcomment-tag\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
The comment block beginning with \fIcomment-tag\fR as the first token of the comment block is added to the output \fB\&.po\fR file as  \fI#\fR delimited comments. For multiple domains, \fBxgettext\fR directs comments and messages to the prevailing text domain.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdefault-domain\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Rename default output file from \fBmessages.po\fR to \fIdefault-domain\fR \fB\&.po\fR.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-j\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Join messages with existing message files.  If a \fB\&.po\fR file does not exist, it is created.  If a \fB\&.po\fR file does exist, new messages are appended.  Any duplicate \fBmsgid\fRs are commented out in the resulting \fB\&.po\fR file.  Domain directives in the existing \fB\&.po\fR file are ignored. Results not guaranteed if the existing message file has been edited.

.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Fill in the \fImsgstr\fR with  \fIprefix\fR. This is useful for debugging purposes. To make \fImsgstr\fR identical to \fImsgid\fR, use an empty string  (\fB""\fR) for \fIprefix\fR.

Fill in the \fImsgstr\fR with  \fIsuffix\fR. This is useful for debugging purposes.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-p\fR \fIpathname\fR\fR

Specify the directory where the output files will be placed. This option overrides the current working directory.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fB-x\fR \fIexclude-file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specify a  \fB\&.po\fR file that contains a list of \fImsgid\fRs that are not to be extracted from the input files. The format of \fIexclude-file\fR is identical to the \fB\&.po\fR file. However, only the \fImsgid\fR directive line in \fIexclude-file\fR is used. All other lines are simply ignored.  The \fB-x\fR option can only be used with the \fB-a\fR option.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBxgettext\fR is not able to extract cast strings, for example ANSI C casts of literal strings to \fB(const char *)\fR. This is unnecessary anyway, since the prototypes in \fB<libintl.h>\fR already specify this type.
.sp
.LP
In messages and translation notes, lines greater than 2048 characters are truncated to 2048 characters and a warning message is printed to stderr.
