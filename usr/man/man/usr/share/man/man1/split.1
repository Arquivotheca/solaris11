.SH NAME
split \- split a file into pieces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBsplit\fR [\fB-linecount\fR | \fB-l\fR \fIlinecount\fR] [\fB-a\fR \fIsuffixlength\fR] 
     [\fIfile\fR [\fIname\fR]]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBsplit\fR [\fB-b\fR \fIn\fR | \fIn\fRk | \fIn\fRm] [\fB-a\fR \fIsuffixlength\fR] [\fIfile\fR [\fIname\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsplit\fR utility reads \fIfile\fR and writes it in \fIlinecount\fR-line pieces into a set of output-files. The name of the first output-file is \fIname\fR with \fBaa\fR appended, and so on lexicographically, up to \fBzz\fR (a maximum of 676 files). The maximum length of \fIname\fR is 2 characters less than the maximum filename length allowed by the filesystem. See \fBstatvfs\fR(2). If no output name is given, \fBx\fR is used as the default (output-files will be called \fBxaa\fR, \fBxab\fR, and so forth).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\(mi\fR\fIlinecount\fR \fB|\fR \fB-l\fR \fIlinecount\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Number of lines in each piece. Defaults to \fB1000\fR lines.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIsuffixlength\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Uses \fIsuffixlength\fR letters to form the suffix portion of the filenames of the split file. If \fB-a\fR is not specified, the default suffix length is \fB2\fR. If the sum of the \fIname\fR operand and the \fIsuffixlength\fR option-argument would create a filename exceeding \fINAME_MAX\fR bytes, an error will result; \fBsplit\fR will exit with a diagnostic message and no files will be created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-b\fR \fIn\fR\fR

\fB\fB-b\fR \fIn\fR\fBm\fR\fR

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
The path name of the ordinary file to be split. If no input file is given or \fIfile\fR is \fB\(mi\fR, the standard input will be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
The prefix to be used for each of the files resulting from the \fBsplit\fR operation. If no \fIname\fR argument is given, \fBx\fR will be used as the prefix of the output files. The combined length of the basename of \fIprefix\fR and \fIsuffixlength\fR cannot exceed \fINAME_MAX\fR bytes. See OPTIONS.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBsplit\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBsplit\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:

.RS 6n
.rt  
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
