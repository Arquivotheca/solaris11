.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "/usr/bin/read"
.sp
.LP
The \fBread\fR utility reads a single line from standard input.
.sp
.LP
By default, unless the \fB-r\fR option is specified, backslash (\fB\e\fR) acts as an escape character. If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is interactive, \fBread\fR prompts for a continuation line when:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The shell reads an input line ending with a backslash, unless the \fB-r\fR option is specified.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A here-document is not terminated after a \fBNEWLINE\fR character is entered.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The line is split into fields as in the shell. The first field is assigned to the first variable \fIvar\fR, the second field to the second variable \fIvar\fR, and so forth. If there are fewer \fIvar\fR operands specified than there are fields, the leftover fields and their intervening separators is assigned to the last \fIvar\fR. If there are fewer fields than \fIvar\fRs, the remaining \fIvar\fRs is set to empty strings.
.sp
.LP
The setting of variables specified by the \fIvar\fR operands affects the current shell execution environment. If it is called in a sub-shell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB(read foo)
nohup read ...
find . -exec read ... \e;\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
It does not affect the shell variables in the caller's environment.
.sp
.LP
The standard input must be a text file.
.SS "sh"
.sp
.LP
One line is read from the standard input and, using the internal field separator, \fBIFS\fR (normally space or tab), to delimit word boundaries, the first word is assigned to the first \fIname\fR, the second word to the second \fIname\fR, and so on, with leftover words assigned to the last \fIname\fR. Lines can be continued using \fB\enewline\fR\&. Characters other than \fBNEWLINE\fR can be quoted by preceding them with a backslash. These backslashes are removed before words are assigned to \fInames\fR, and no interpretation is done on the character that follows the backslash. The return code is \fB0\fR, unless an end-of-file is encountered.
.SS "csh"
.sp
.LP
The notation:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
set \fIvariable\fR \fB= $<\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
loads one line of standard input as the value for \fIvariable\fR. (See \fBcsh\fR(1)).
.SS "ksh88"
.sp
.LP
The shell input mechanism. One line is read and is broken up into fields using the characters in \fBIFS\fR as separators. The escape character, \fB(\e)\fR, is used to remove any special meaning for the next character and for line continuation. In raw mode, the \fB-r\fR, the \fB,\fR and the \fB\e\fR character are not treated specially. The first field is assigned to the first \fIname\fR, the second field to the second \fIname\fR, and so on, with leftover fields assigned to the last \fIname\fR. The \fB-p\fR option causes the input line to be taken from the input pipe of a process spawned by the shell using \fB|&\fR. If the \fB-s\fR flag is present, the input is saved as a command in the history file. The flag \fB-u\fR can be used to specify a one digit file descriptor unit \fIn\fR to read from. The file descriptor can be opened with the \fBexec\fR special command. The default value of \fIn\fR is \fB0\fR. If \fIname\fR is omitted, \fBREPLY\fR is used as the default \fIname\fR. The exit status is \fB0\fR unless the input file is not open for reading or an end-of-file is encountered. An end-of-file with the \fB-p\fR option causes cleanup for this process so that another can be spawned. If the first argument contains a \fB?\fR, the remainder of this word is used as a \fIprompt\fR on standard error when the shell is interactive. The exit status is \fB0\fR unless an end-of-file is encountered.
.SS "ksh"
.sp
.LP
\fBread\fR reads a line from standard input and breaks it into fields using the characters in the value of the \fBIFS\fR variable as separators. The escape character, \fB\e\fR, is used to remove any special meaning for the next character and for line continuation unless the \fB-r\fR option is specified.
.sp
.LP
If there are more variables than fields, the remaining variables are set to empty strings. If there are fewer variables than fields, the leftover fields and their intervening separators are assigned to the last variable. If no \fIvar\fR is specified, the variable \fBREPLY\fR is used. 
.sp
.LP
When \fIvar\fR has the binary attribute and \fB-n\fR or \fB-N\fR is specified, the bytes that are read are stored directly into \fIvar\fR.
.sp
.LP
If you specify \fB?\fR\fIprompt\fR after the first \fIvar\fR, \fBread\fR displays a prompt on standard error when standard input is a terminal or pipe.
