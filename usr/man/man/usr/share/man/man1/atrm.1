.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBatrm\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Affirmative responses are processed using the extended regular expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR keyword in the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category of the user's locale. The locale specified in the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category defines the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the expression defined for \fByesexpr\fR. The locale specified in \fBLC_CTYPE\fR determines the locale for interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data a characters, the behavior of character classes used in the expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR. See \fBlocale\fR(5)
