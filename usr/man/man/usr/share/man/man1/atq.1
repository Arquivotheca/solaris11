.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBatq\fR utility displays the \fBat\fR jobs queued up for the current user. \fBat\fR(1) is a utility that allows users to execute commands at a later date. If invoked by a user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization, \fBatq\fR will display all jobs in the queue.
.sp
.LP
If no options are given, the jobs are displayed in chronological order of execution.

When an authorized user invokes \fBatq\fR without specifying \fIusername\fR, the entire queue is displayed; when a \fIusername\fR is specified, only those jobs belonging to the named user are displayed.
