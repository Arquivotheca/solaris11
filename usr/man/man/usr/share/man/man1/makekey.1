.SH NAME
makekey \- generate encryption key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/makekey\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmakekey\fR improves the usefulness of encryption schemes that depend on a key by increasing the amount of time required to search the key space. It attempts to read 8 bytes for its \fIkey\fR (the first eight input bytes), then it attempts to read 2 bytes for its \fIsalt\fR (the last two input bytes). The output depends on the input in a way intended to be difficult to compute (that is, to require a substantial fraction of a second).
.sp
.LP
The first eight input bytes (the \fIinput key\fR) can be arbitrary \fBASCII\fR characters. The last two (the \fIsalt\fR) are best chosen from the set of digits, \fB\&.\fR, \fB/\fR, upper- and lower-case letters. The salt characters are repeated as the first two characters of the output. The remaining 11 output characters are chosen from the same set as the  \fIsalt\fR and constitute the \fIoutput key\fR.
.sp
.LP
The transformation performed is essentially the following: the  \fIsalt\fR is used to select one of 4,096 cryptographic machines all based on the National Bureau of Standards \fBDES\fR algorithm, but broken in 4,096 different ways. Using the \fIinput\fR \fIkey\fR as key, a constant string is fed into the machine and recirculated a number of times. The 64 bits that come out are distributed into the 66 \fIoutput\fR \fIkey\fR bits in the result.
.sp
.LP
\fBmakekey\fR is intended for programs that perform encryption. Usually, its input and output will be pipes.

.SH NOTES

.LP
\fBmakekey\fR can produce different results depending upon whether the input is typed at the terminal or redirected from a file.
