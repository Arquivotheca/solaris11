.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmore\fR utility is a filter that displays the contents of a text file on the terminal, one screenful at a time.  It normally pauses after each screenful. \fB/usr/bin/more\fR then prints \fB--More--\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/more\fR then prints \fIfile\fR at the bottom of the screen. If \fBmore\fR is reading from a file rather than a pipe, the percentage of characters displayed so far is also shown.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmore\fR utility scrolls up to display one more line in response to a \fBRETURN\fR character. \fBmore\fR displays another screenful in response to a \fBSPACE\fR character. Other commands are listed below.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpage\fR utility clears the screen before displaying the next screenful of text. \fBpage\fR only provides a one-line overlap between screens.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmore\fR utility sets the terminal to \fBNOECHO\fR mode, so that the output can be continuous. Commands that you type do not normally show up on your terminal, except for the \fB/\fR and \fB!\fR commands.
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/more\fR utility exits after displaying the last specified file. \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/more\fR prompts for a command at the last line of the last specified file.
.sp
.LP
If the standard output is not a terminal, \fBmore\fR acts just like \fBcat\fR(1), except that a header is printed before each file in a series.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for both \fB/usr/bin/more\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/more\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Clears before displaying. Redraws the screen instead of scrolling for faster displays. This option is ignored if the terminal does not have the ability to clear to the end of a line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Displays error messages rather than ringing the terminal bell if an unrecognized command is used. This is helpful for inexperienced users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Squeeze.  Replaces multiple blank lines with a single blank line. This is helpful when viewing \fBnroff\fR(1) output on the screen.
.RE

.SS "/usr/bin/more"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for \fB/usr/bin/more\fR only:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Does not fold long lines. This is useful when lines contain nonprinting characters or escape sequences, such as those generated when \fBnroff\fR(1) output is piped through \fBul\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Does not treat \fBFORMFEED\fR characters (Control-l) as page breaks. If \fB-l\fR is not used, \fBmore\fR pauses to accept commands after any line containing a \fB^L\fR character (Control-l). Also, if a file begins with a \fBFORMFEED\fR, the screen is cleared before the file is printed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Normally, \fBmore\fR ignores control characters that it does not interpret in some way. The \fB-r\fR option causes these to be displayed as \fB^\fR\fIC\fR where \fIC\fR stands for any such control character.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Suppresses generation of underlining escape sequences. Normally, \fBmore\fR handles underlining, such as that produced by \fBnroff\fR(1), in a manner appropriate to the terminal. If the terminal can perform underlining or has a stand-out mode, \fBmore\fR supplies appropriate escape sequences as called for in the text file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Normally, \fBmore\fR exits when it comes to the end of its input. With \fB-w\fR, however, \fBmore\fR prompts and waits for any key to be struck before exiting.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-\fR\fIlines\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Displays the indicated number of \fIlines\fR in each screenful, rather than the default (the number of lines in the terminal screen less two).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIlinenumber\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Start up at \fIlinenumber\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Start up two lines above the line containing the regular expression \fIpattern\fR. \fBNote:\fR Unlike editors, this construct should \fInot\fR end with a `\fB/\fR.' If it does, then the trailing slash is taken as a character in the search pattern.
.RE

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/more"
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/more\fR only:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Exits immediately after writing the last line of the last file in the argument list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Performs pattern matching in searches without regard to case.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fInumber\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Specifies the number of lines per screenful. The \fInumber\fR argument is a positive decimal integer. The \fB-n\fR option overrides any values obtained from the environment.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIcommand\fR \fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIcommand\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
For each file examined, initially executes the \fBmore\fR command in the \fIcommand\fR argument. If the command is a positioning command, such as a line number or a regular expression search, set the current position to represent the final results of the command, without writing any intermediate lines of the file. For example, the two commands:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBmore -p 1000j file  
more -p 1000G file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

are equivalent and start the display with the current position at line 1000, bypassing the lines that \fBj\fR would write and scroll off the screen if it had been issued during the file examination. If the positioning command is unsuccessful, the first line in the file will be the current position.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItagstring\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Writes the screenful of the file containing the tag named by the \fItagstring\fR argument. See the \fBctags\fR(1) utility.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Treats a backspace character as a printable control character, displayed as a ^H (Control-h), suppressing backspacing and the special handling that produces underlined or standout-mode text on some terminal types.  Also, does not ignore a carriage-return character at the end of a line.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If both the \fB-t\fR\fI tagstring\fR and \fB-p\fR\fI command\fR (or the obsolescent \fI+command\fR) options are given, the \fB-t\fR\fI tagstring\fR is processed first.
.SH USAGE
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
\fBmore\fR uses the terminal's \fBterminfo\fR(4) entry to determine its display characteristics.
.sp
.LP
\fBmore\fR looks in the environment variable \fBMORE\fR for any preset options. For instance, to page through files using the \fB-c\fR mode by default, set the value of this variable to \fB-c\fR. (Normally, the command sequence to set up this environment variable is placed in the \fB\&.login\fR or \fB\&.profile\fR file).
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
The commands take effect immediately. It is not necessary to type a carriage return unless the command requires a \fIfile\fR, \fIcommand\fR, \fItagstring\fR, or \fIpattern\fR. Up to the time when the command character itself is given, the user may type the line kill character to cancel the numerical argument being formed. In addition, the user may type the erase character to redisplay the `\fB--More--(\fR\fIxx\fR%)' or \fIfile\fR message.
.sp
.LP
