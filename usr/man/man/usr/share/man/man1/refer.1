.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrefer\fR is a preprocessor for \fBnroff\fR(1), or \fBtroff\fR(1), that finds and formats references. The input files (standard input by default) are copied to the standard output, except for lines between `\fB\&.\|[\fR' and `\fB\&.\|]\fR' command lines, Such lines are assumed to contain keywords as for \fBlookbib\fR(1), and are replaced by information from a bibliographic data base.  The user can avoid the search, override fields from it, or add new fields. The reference data, from whatever source, is assigned to a set of \fBtroff\fR strings.  Macro packages such as \fBms\fR(5) print the finished reference text from these strings.  A flag is placed in the text at the point of reference. By default, the references are indicated by numbers.
.sp
.LP
When \fBrefer\fR is used with \fBeqn\fR(1), \fBneqn\fR, or \fBtbl\fR(1), \fBrefer\fR should be used first in the sequence, to minimize the volume of data passed through pipes.

\fB\fB-k\fR\fIx\fR\fR

.RS 15n

Instead of numbering references, use labels as specified in a reference data line beginning with the characters \fI%x\fR; By default, \fIx\fR is \fBL\fR.

\fB\fB-l\fR\fIm,n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Instead of numbering references, use labels from the senior author's last name and the year of publication.  Only the first \fIm\fR letters of the last name and the last \fIn\fR digits of the date are used.  If either of \fIm\fR or \fIn\fR is omitted, the entire name or date, respectively, is used.

Take the next argument as a file of references to be searched.  The default file is searched last.

\fB\fB-s\fR\fIkeys\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Sort references by fields whose key-letters are in the \fIkeys\fR string, and permute reference numbers in the text accordingly. Using this option implies the \fB-e\fR option. The key-letters in \fIkeys\fR may be followed by a number indicating how many such fields are used, with a \fB+\fR sign taken as a very large number.  The default is \fB\fR\fBAD\fR\fB,\fR which sorts on the senior author and date. To sort on all authors and then the date, for instance, use the options `\fB-sA+T\fR'.
