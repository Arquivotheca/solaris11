.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmoe\fR utility manifests the optimal expansion of a pathname containing reserved runtime linker tokens. These tokens can be used to define dependencies, filtees and runpaths within dynamic objects. The expansion of these tokens at runtime, provides a flexible mechanism for selecting objects and search paths that perform best on this machine. See \fBld.so.1\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
For example, the token \fB$HWCAP\fR can be employed to represent filters and dependencies. The runtime interpretation of this token can result in a family of objects that are analyzed to determine their applicability for loading with a process. The objects are sorted based on the hardware capabilities that each object requires to execute. \fBmoe\fR returns the name of the object optimally suited for execution on the current platform.
.sp
.LP
\fBmoe\fR analyzes a pathname by passing the supplied \fIpath\fR to \fBdlmopen\fR(3C), together with the \fBRTLD_FIRST\fR flag. Reserved token expansion is therefore carried out by \fBld.so.1\fR as the expansion would occur in an executing process. Although multiple objects can be analyzed as a result of the \fBdlmopen()\fR call, the \fBRTLD_FIRST\fR flag insures only the optimal object is processed.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBmoe\fR analyzes the specified \fIpath\fR twice. The first analysis looks for 32-bit objects. The second analysis, if applicable, looks for 64-bit objects. Typically, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects are isolated to different directories. These directories are frequently named to reflect the class of object the directory contains. The multiple passes of \fBmoe\fR catch any instances where 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects occupy the same directory. Multiple passes also provide flexibility when the pathname that is specified does not convey to the user the class of object the directory might contain.

For a complete description of the reserved token expansion carried out by the runtime linker, refer to the \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-32\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Only analyze 32-bit objects.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-64\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Only analyze 64-bit objects.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Prefix each pathname with the class of the object.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Silent. No optimal name, or error diagnostics are displayed. Only an error return is made available. This option is only meaningful with the \fB-32\fR and \fB-64\fR options. The \fB-s\fR option can not be used with the \fB-v\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Verbose. If no optimal expansion name can be determined, an error diagnostic is written to standard error. The \fB-v\fR option can not be used with the \fB-s\fR option.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
The pathname to be expanded.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBmoe\fR to display the optimal expansion of objects in the directory \fB/usr/lib/libc\fR. This directory contains a family of Intel objects that are built to use various hardware capabilities.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBmoe '/usr/lib/libc/$HWCAP'\fR
/usr/lib/libc/libc_hwcap.so.1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-c\fR option can be used to clarify the class of the optimal object.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBmoe -c '/usr/lib/libc/$HWCAP'\fR
32-bit: /usr/lib/libc/libc_hwcap.so.1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBmoe\fR to display the optimal expansion of objects under the \fB/opt/ISV/cpu\fR directory hierarchy. These directories contain a family of SPARC objects that are built for various platforms.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBmoe -c -64 '/opt/ISV/$ISALIST/isa.so.1'\fR
64-bit: /opt/ISV/sparcv9/isa.so.1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-v\fR can be used to diagnose the instance where an optimal name is not returned. An attempt to inspect the previous pathname as a 32-bit object, would result in the following diagnostic being produced.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
% \fBmoe -c -v -32 '/opt/ISV/$ISALIST/isa.so.1'\fR
32-bit: /opt/ISV/sparcv9/isa.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
When the \fB-32\fR or \fB-64\fR options are in effect, a successful optimal expansion returns \fB0\fR, otherwise non-zero. Without the \fB-32\fR or \fB-64\fR options in effect, the return value is always \fB0\fR.
