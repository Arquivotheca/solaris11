.SH NAME
lorder \- find ordering relation for an object or library archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlorder\fR \fIfilename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The input is one or more object or library archive \fIfilenames\fR (see \fBar\fR(1)). The standard output is a list of pairs of object file or archive member names; the first file of the pair refers to external identifiers defined in the second. The output may be processed by \fBtsort\fR(1) to find an ordering of a library suitable for one-pass access by \fBld\fR. Note that the link editor \fBld\fR is capable of multiple passes over an archive in the portable archive format (see \fBar.h\fR(3HEAD)) and does not require that \fBlorder\fR be used when building an archive.  The usage of  the \fBlorder\fR command may, however, allow for a more efficient access of the archive during the link edit process.

The following example builds a new library from existing \fB\&.o\fR files.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBlorder\fR will accept as input any object or archive file, regardless of its suffix, provided there is more than one input file. If there is but a single input file, its suffix must be \fB\&.o\fR.
.sp
.LP
The length of the filename for \fBTMPDIR\fR is limited to whatever \fBsed\fR allows.
