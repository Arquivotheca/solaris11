.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmesg\fR utility will control whether other users are allowed to send messages via \fBwrite\fR(1), \fBtalk\fR(1), or other utilities to a terminal device. The terminal device affected is determined by searching for the first terminal in the sequence of devices associated with standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively. With no arguments, \fBmesg\fR reports the current state without changing it. Processes with appropriate privileges may be able to send messages to the terminal independent of the current state.
