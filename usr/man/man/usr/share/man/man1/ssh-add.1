.SH NAME
ssh-add \- add RSA or DSA identities to the authentication agent
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBssh-add\fR [\fB-lLdDxX\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fIlife\fR] [ \fIfile\fR ]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBssh-add\fR utility adds \fBRSA\fR or \fBDSA\fR identities to the authentication agent, \fBssh-agent\fR(1). When run without arguments, it attempts to add all of the files \fB$HOME/.ssh/identity\fR (RSA v1), \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa\fR (RSA v2), and \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa\fR (DSA v2) that exist. If more than one of the private keys exists, an attempt to decrypt each with the same passphrase is made before reprompting for a different passphrase. The passphrase is read from the user's tty or by running the program defined in \fBSSH_ASKPASS\fR (see below).
.sp
.LP
The authentication agent must be running.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Instead of adding the identity, this option \fBremoves\fR the identity from the agent.

Deletes all identities from the agent.

\fB\fB-t\fR \fIlife\fR\fR

Sets a maximum lifetime when adding identities to an agent. The lifetime can be specified in seconds or in a time format specified in \fBsshd\fR(1M).

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBSSH_ASKPASS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n

If \fBssh-add\fR needs a passphrase, it reads the passphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal. If \fBssh-add\fR does not have a terminal associated with it but \fBDISPLAY\fR and \fBSSH_ASKPASS\fR are set, it executes the program specified by \fBSSH_ASKPASS\fR and open an X11 window to read the passphrase. This is particularly useful when calling \fBssh-add\fR from a .Xsession or related script. The system is shipped with \fB/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-askpass\fR which is the default value for \fBSSH_ASKPASS\fR.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS

The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR

.rt  
Successful completion.

.RS 5n
.rt  
An error occurred.
.RE

.SH FILES
.sp
.LP
These files should not be readable by anyone but the user. Notice that \fBssh-add\fR ignores a file if it is accessible by others. It is possible to specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase is used to encrypt the private part of this file.
.sp
.LP
If these files are stored on a network file system it is assumed that either the protection provided in the file themselves or the transport layer of the network file system provides sufficient protection for the site policy. If this is not the case, then it is recommended the key files are stored on removable media or locally on the relevant hosts.
