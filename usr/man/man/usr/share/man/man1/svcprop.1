.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsvcprop\fR utility prints values of properties in the service configuration repository. Properties are selected by \fB-p\fR options and the operands.
.sp
.LP
Without the \fB-C\fR, \fB-c\fR, or \fB-s\fR options, \fBsvcprop\fR accesses effective properties. The effective properties of a service are its directly attached properties. The effective properties of a service instance are the union of properties in the composed view of its \fBrunning\fR snapshot and the properties in non-persistent property groups in the composed view of the instance's directly attached properties. See \fBsmf\fR(5) for an explanation of property composition. If the \fBrunning\fR snapshot does not exist then the instance's directly attached properties are used instead. 
.SS "Output Format"
.sp
.LP
By default, when a single property is selected, the values for each are printed on separate lines. Empty \fBASCII\fR string values are represented by a pair of double quotes (\fB""\fR). Bourne shell metacharacters ('\fB;\fR', '\fB&\fR\&', \&'\fB(\fR', '\fB)\fR', '\fB|\fR', '\fB^\fR', '\fB<\fR\&', '\fB>\fR', newline, space, tab, backslash, '\fB"\fR', single-quote, '\fB`\fR') in \fBASCII\fR string values are quoted by backslashes (\fB\e\fR).
.sp
.LP
When multiple properties are selected, a single line is printed for each. Each line comprises a property designator, a property type, and the values (as described above), separated by spaces. By default, if a single \fIFMRI\fR operand has been supplied, the property designator consists of the property group name and the property name joined by a slash (\fB/\fR). If multiple \fIFMRI\fR operands are supplied, the designator is the canonical \fIFMRI\fR for the property.
.sp
.LP
If access controls prohibit reading the value of a property, and no property or property group is specified explicitly by a \fB-p\fR option, the property is displayed as if it had no values. If one or more property or property group names is specified by a \fB-p\fR option, and any property value cannot be read due to access controls, an error results.
.sp
.LP
Error messages are printed to the standard error stream.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Waits until the specified property group or the property group containing the specified property changes before printing.
.sp
This option is only valid when a single entity is specified. If more than one operand is specified, or an operand matches more than one instance, an error message is printed and no action is taken. The -C option is implied. 
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIFMRI\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The FMRI of a service, a service instance, a property group, or a property.
.sp
Instances and services can be abbreviated by specifying the instance name, or the trailing portion of the service name. Properties and property groups must be specified by a full FMRI. For example, given the FMRI:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The following are valid abbreviations:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sendmail
:sendmail
smtp
smtp:sendmail
network/smtp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The following are invalid abbreviations:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
mailnetwork
network/smt
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Abbreviated forms of FMRIs are Uncommitted and should not be used in scripts or other permanent tools. If an abbreviation matches multiple instances, \fBsvcprop\fR acts on each instance.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBpattern\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
A glob pattern which is matched against the FMRIs of services and instances in the repository. See \fBfnmatch\fR(5). If a pattern matches multiple services or instances, \fBsvcprop\fR acts on each service or instance.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRDisplaying the Value of a Single Property
.sp
.LP
The following example displays the value of the state property in the restarter property group of instance \fBdefault\fR of service \fBsystem/cron\fR.

\fBExample 2 \fRRetrieving Whether a Service is Enabled
.sp
.LP
Whether a service is enabled is determined by its \fB-general/enabled\fR property. This property takes immediate effect, so the \fB-c\fR option must be used:

.sp

.nf
example%  svcprop -c -p general/enabled system/cron:default
true
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRDisplaying All Properties in a Property Group
.sp
.LP
On a default installation of Solaris, the following example displays all properties in the \fBgeneral\fR property group of each instance of the \fBnetwork/ntp\fR service:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% svcprop -p general ntp
general/package astring SUNWntpr
general/enabled boolean true
general/entity_stability astring Uncommitted
