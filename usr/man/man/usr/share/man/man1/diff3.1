.SH NAME
diff3 \- 3-way differential file comparison
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdiff3\fR [\fB-exEX3\fR] \fIfilename1\fR \fIfilename2\fR \fIfilename3\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdiff3\fR compares three versions of a file. It publishes disagreeing ranges of text flagged with the following codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB====\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
all three files differ
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB====1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
\fIfilename1\fRis different
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB====2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt

.RE

.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fB====3\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
\fIfilename3\fRis different
.RE

.sp
.LP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range of a given file to some other is indicated in one of the following ways:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIf\fR\fB : \fR\fIn1\fR\fB a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Text is to be appended after line number \fIn1\fR in file \fIf\fR, where \fIf\fR = 1, 2, or 3.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIf\fR\fB : \fR\fIn1\fR\fB , \fR\fIn2\fR\fB c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Text is to be changed in the range line \fIn1\fR to line \fIn2\fR. If \fIn1\fR = \fIn\fR2, the range can be abbreviated to \fIn1\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The original contents of the range follows immediately after a \fBc\fR indication. When the contents of two files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered file is suppressed.
.sp
.LP
The following command applies the resulting script to \fIfilename1\fR.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB(cat script; echo a\'1,$pa\') | ed \(mi \fR\fIfilename1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Produce a script for the \fBed\fR(1) editor that incorporates into \fIfilename1\fR all changes between \fIfilename2\fR and \fIfilename3\fR (that is, the changes that normally would be flagged \fB====\fR and \fB====3\fR).
.sp
Text lines that consist of a single dot (\fB\&.\fR defeat the \fB-e\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Produce a script that incorporates all changes between \fIfilename2\fR and \fIfilename3\fR, but treat overlapping changes (that is, changes that would be flagged with \fB====\fR in the normal listing) differently. The overlapping lines from both files are inserted by the edit script, bracketed by \fB<<<<<<\fR and \fB>>>>>>\fR lines.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Produce a script to incorporate only changes flagged \fB====\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-X\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Produce a script that incorporates only changes flagged \fB====\fR, but treat these changes in the manner of the \fB-E\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-3\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
.rt  
Produce a script to incorporate only changes flagged \fB====3\fR.
