.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdhcpinfo\fR utility prints the \fBDHCP\fR-supplied value(s) of the parameter requested on the command line. The parameter can be identified either by its numeric code in the \fBDHCP\fR specification, or by its mnemonic identifier, as listed in \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4). This command is intended to be used in command substitutions in the shell scripts invoked by \fBinit\fR(1M) at system boot. It first contacts the \fBDHCP\fR client daemon at system boot or in event scripts as described in \fBdhcpagent\fR(1M). It first contacts the DHCP client daemon \fBdhcpagent\fR(1M) to verify that \fBDHCP\fR has successfully completed on the requested interface. If \fBDHCP\fR has successfully completed on the requested interface, \fBdhcpinfo\fR retrieves the values for the requested parameter. Parameter values echoed by \fBdhcpinfo\fR should not be used without checking its exit status. See \fBexit\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
See \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4) for the list of mnemonic identifier codes for all \fBDHCP\fR parameters. See \fIRFC 2132, DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions\fR for more details on DHCPv4 parameters, and RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), for more details on DHCPv6 parameters.
.SS "Output Format"
.sp
.LP
The output from \fBdhcpinfo\fR consists of one or more lines of \fBASCII\fR text; the format of the output depends upon the requested parameter. The number of values returned per line and the total number of lines output for a given parameter are determined by the parameter's \fBgranularity\fR and \fBmaximum\fR values, respectively, as defined by \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
The format of each individual value is determined by the data type of the option, as determined by \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4). The possible data types and their formats are listed below:

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Displays the output in a canonical format. This format is identical to the \fBOCTET\fR format with a granularity of \fB1\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIinterface\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies the interface to retrieve values for \fBDHCP\fR parameters from. If this option is not specified, the primary interface is used.
.sp
If a primary interface has not been selected for the system by \fBifconfig\fR(1M) or for this command by \fB-i\fR, the system automatically selects an interface to consider as primary for the current command invocation. The selection chooses the interface whose name sorts lexically first, and that has DHCP parameters attached.  This selection does not affect system state. Use \fBifconfig\fR(1M) to set a primary interface. 
.sp
The recommended practice in the \fBdhcpagent\fR(1M) \fBeventhook\fR scripts is to specify the desired interface with \fB-i\fR, rather than relying on primary selection.
.sp
For DHCPv6, the interface name used should be the name of the physical interface, not one of the logical interfaces created by \fBdhcpagent\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIlimit\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Limits the list of values displayed to \fIlimit\fR lines.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fB4 | 6\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies the DHCP version to query. Use \fB-v4\fRfor DHCPv4 and \fB-v6\fR for DHCPv6.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Numeric code for the requested \fBDHCP\fR parameter, as defined by the \fBDHCP\fR specification. Vendor options are specified by adding \fB256\fR to the actual vendor code for DHCPv4, and \fB65536\fR for DHCPv6.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIidentifier\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Mnemonic symbol for the requested \fBDHCP\fR parameter, as listed in \fBdhcp_inittab\fR(4).
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 5n
.rt  
The operation was not successful. The \fBDHCP\fR client daemon might not be running, the interface might have failed to configure, or no satisfactory \fBDHCP\fR responses were received.
