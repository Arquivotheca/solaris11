.SH NAME
eject \- eject media such as CD-ROM from drive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBeject\fR [\fB-dflqt\fR] [ [\fIdevice\fR | \fInickname\fR]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBeject\fR utility is used for those removable media devices that do not have a manual eject button, or for those that might be locked due to, for instance, being mounted. The device may be specified by its name or by a nickname. If no device is specified, the default device is used.
.sp
.LP
Only devices that support \fBeject\fR under program control respond to this command.
.sp
.LP
When \fBeject\fR is used on media that can only be ejected manually, it does everything except remove the media, including unmounting the file system if it is mounted. In this case, \fBeject\fR displays a message that the media can now be manually ejected.
.sp
.LP
Do not physically eject media from a device that contains mounted file systems. \fBeject\fR automatically searches for any mounted file systems that reside on the device, and attempts to umount them prior to ejecting the media. See \fBmount\fR(1M). If the unmount operation fails, \fBeject\fR prints a warning message and exits. The \fB-f\fR option can be used to specify an eject even if the device contains mounted partitions.
.sp
.LP
Pressing the physical media eject button located on some drives' front panel has the same effect as invoking \fBeject\fR for the respective drive. Not all drives have this capability.
