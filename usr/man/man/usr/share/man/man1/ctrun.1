.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBctrun\fR utility starts a command in a newly created process contract. \fBctrun\fR holds the contract and can be instructed to output or respond to events that occur within the contract.
.sp
.LP
For additional information about process contracts, see \fBcontract\fR(4) and \fBprocess\fR(4).

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhwerr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A member process encountered a hardware error.

\fBhwerr\fR events are fatal by default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBsignal\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A member process received a fatal signal from a process in a different process contract.
.RE

Only \fBcore\fR, \fBhwerr\fR, and \fBsignal\fR events can be made fatal.
.sp
More events can be delivered than requested if \fBctrun\fR requires them for its own purposes. For example, \fBempty\fR messages are always requested if a lifetime of \fBcontract\fR is specified. See \fB-l\fR.

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIfmri\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 26n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIlifetime\fR\fR
.ad

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnoorphan\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Kills all processes in the contract if the holder (\fBctrun\fR) exits.

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBpgrponly\fR\fR

.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIcount\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt

.sp
This option is invalid if a lifetime other than \fBcontract\fR is specified or if the \fBpgrponly\fR option is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt  
If the contract created by \fBctrun\fR inherited subcontracts from its member processes, attempts to transfer them to the new contract when restarting. 
.sp
This option is invalid unless \fB-r\fR is also specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-v\fR\fR

.SH OPERANDS

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIargument\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The command to be passed to \fBexecvp\fR(2). See \fBexec\fR(2).

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRRunning a Shell in a New Process Contract
.sp
.LP
The following example runs a shell in a new process contract:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% ctrun -l child -o pgrponly ksh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-l\fR \fBchild\fR option argument is specified so that \fBctrun\fR won't wait until all children of the shell have exited. \fB-o\fR \fBpgrponly\fR is specified because an interactive \fBksh\fR puts each job in a new process group, and an error in one job is unlikely to affect the others.

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRRunning a Simple Server
.sp
.LP
The following example runs a simple server:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBctrun -r 0 -t -f hwerr,core,signal server\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The \fB-r\fR \fB0\fR and \fB-t\fR options are specified to indicate that if the server encounters a fatal error, \fBctrun\fR should try to restart it. The \fB-f\fR option makes "\fBhwerr\fR", "\fBcore\fR", and "\fBsignal\fR" fatal events.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
If \fIcommand\fR is specified and successfully invoked (see \fBexec\fR(2)), the exit status of \fBctrun\fR is the exit status of \fIcommand\fR. Otherwise, \fBctrun\fR exits with one of the following values:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB123\fR\fR

.RS 7n
.rt  
The child process exited abnormally.
