.SH NAME
isalist \- display the native instruction sets executable on this platform
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBisalist\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBisalist\fR prints the names of the native instruction sets executable on this platform on the standard output, as returned by the \fBSI_ISALIST\fR command of \fBsysinfo\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The names are space-separated and are ordered in the sense of best performance. That is, earlier-named instruction sets might contain more instructions than later-named instruction sets; a program that is compiled for an earlier-named instruction sets will most likely run faster on this machine than the same program compiled for a later-named instruction set.
.sp
.LP
Programs compiled for instruction sets that do not appear in the list will most likely experience performance degradation or not run at all on this machine.
.sp
.LP
The instruction set names known to the system are listed in \fBisalist\fR(5). These names might or might not match predefined names or compiler options in the C language compilation system,
.sp
.LP
This command is obsolete and may be removed in a future version of Solaris. See \fBisainfo\fR(1) for a better way to handle instruction set extensions.
