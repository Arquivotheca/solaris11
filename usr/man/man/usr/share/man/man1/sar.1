.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In the first instance, the \fBsar\fR utility samples cumulative activity counters in the operating system at \fIn\fR intervals of \fIt\fR seconds, where \fIt\fR should be \fB5\fR or greater. If \fIt\fR is specified with more than one option, all headers are printed together and the output can be difficult to read. (If the sampling interval is less than \fB5\fR, the activity of \fBsar\fR itself can affect the sample.) If the \fB-o\fR option is specified, it saves the samples in \fIfilename\fR in binary format. The default value of \fIn\fR is \fB1\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the second instance, no sampling interval is specified. \fBsar\fR extracts data from a previously recorded \fIfilename\fR, either the one specified by the \fB-f\fR option or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file \fB/var/adm/sa/sa\fIdd\fR\fR for the current day \fIdd\fR. The starting and ending times of the report can be bounded using the \fB-e\fR and \fB-s\fR arguments with \fItime\fR specified in the form \fIhh\fR[:\fImm\fR[:\fIss\fR]]. The \fB-i\fR option selects records at \fIsec\fR second intervals. Otherwise, all intervals found in the data file are reported.
