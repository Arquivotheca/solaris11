.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpgrep\fR utility examines the active processes on the system and reports the process \fBID\fRs of the processes whose attributes match the criteria specified on the command line. Each process \fBID\fR is printed as a decimal value and is separated from the next \fBID\fR by a delimiter string, which defaults to a newline. For each attribute option, the user can specify a set of possible values separated by commas on the command line. For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBpgrep -G other,daemon\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
matches processes whose real group \fBID\fR is \fBother\fR \fBOR\fR \fBdaemon\fR. If multiple criteria options are specified, \fBpgrep\fR matches processes whose attributes match the logical \fBAND\fR of the criteria options. For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBpgrep -G other,daemon -U root,daemon\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
matches processes whose attributes are:
.br
.in +2
(real group \fBID\fR is \fBother\fR \fBOR\fR \fBdaemon\fR) \fBAND\fR 
.in -2
.br
.in +2
(real user \fBID\fR is \fBroot\fR \fBOR\fR \fBdaemon\fR) 
.in -2
.sp
.LP
\fBpkill\fR functions identically to \fBpgrep\fR, except that each matching process is signaled as if by \fBkill\fR(1) instead of having its process \fBID\fR printed. A signal name or number may be specified as the first command line option to \fBpkill\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIctidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Matches only processes whose process contract ID is in the given list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdelim\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Specifies the output delimiter string to be printed between each matching process \fBID\fR. If no \fB-d\fR option is specified, the default is a newline character. The \fB-d\fR option is only valid when specified as an option to \fBpgrep\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The regular expression \fIpattern\fR should be matched against the full process argument string (obtained from the \fBpr_psargs\fR field of the \fB/proc/\fInnnnn\fR/psinfo\fR file). If no \fB-f\fR option is specified, the expression is matched only against the name of the executable file (obtained from the \fBpr_fname\fR field of the \fB/proc/\fInnnnn\fR/psinfo\fR file).

.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Matches only processes whose process group \fBID\fR is in the given list. If group 0 is included in the list, this is interpreted as the process group \fBID\fR of the \fBpgrep\fR or \fBpkill\fR process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-G\fR \fIgidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt

Long output format. Prints the process name along with the process \fBID\fR of each matching process. The process name is obtained from the \fBpr_psargs\fR or \fBpr_fname\fR field, depending on whether the \fB-f\fR option was specified (see above). The \fB-l\fR option is only valid when specified as an option to \fBpgrep\fR.

\fB\fB-s\fR \fIsidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Matches only processes whose process session \fBID\fR is in in the given list. If \fBID\fR 0 is included in the list, this is interpreted as the session \fBID\fR of the \fBpgrep\fR or \fBpkill\fR process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fItermlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Matches only processes which are associated with a terminal in the given list. Each terminal is specified as the suffix following "/dev/" of the terminal's device path name in \fB/dev\fR. For example, \fBterm/a\fR or \fBpts/0\fR.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fItaskidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt

.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Considers only processes whose argument string or executable file name \fBexactly\fR matches the specified \fIpattern\fR to be matching processes. The pattern match is considered to be exact when all characters in the process argument string or executable file name match the pattern.

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzoneidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
Matches only processes whose zone \fBID\fR is in the given list. Each zone \fBID\fR may be specified as either a zone name or a numerical zone \fBID\fR. This option is only useful when executed in the global zone. If the \fBpkill\fR utility is used to send signals to processes in  other zones, the process must have asserted the \fB{PRIV_PROC_ZONE}\fR privilege (see \fBprivileges\fR(5)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-\fR\fIsignal\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt

The value of \fIsignal\fR can be one of the symbolic names defined in \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD) without the \fBSIG\fR prefix, or the corresponding signal number as a decimal value. The \fB-\fR\fIsignal\fR option is only valid when specified as the first option to \fBpkill\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Both utilities match the \fBERE\fR \fIpattern\fR argument against either the \fBpr_fname\fR or \fBpr_psargs\fR fields of the \fB/proc/\fR\fInnnnn\fR\fB/psinfo\fR files. The lengths of these strings are limited according to definitions in \fB<sys/procfs.h>\fR\&. Patterns which can match strings longer than the current limits may fail to match the intended set of processes.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIpattern\fR argument contains \fBERE\fR meta-characters which are also shell meta-characters, it may be necessary to enclose the pattern with appropriate shell quotes.
.sp
.LP
Defunct processes are never matched by either \fBpgrep\fR or \fBpkill\fR.
.sp
.LP
The current \fBpgrep\fR or \fBpkill\fR process will never consider itself a potential match.
