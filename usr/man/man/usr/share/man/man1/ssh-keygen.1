.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBssh-keygen\fR utility generates, manages, and converts authentication keys for \fBssh\fR(1). \fBssh-keygen\fR can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The type of key to be generated is specified with the \fB-t\fR option. \fBssh-keygen\fR can also generate fingerprints or convert the public keys from the X.509v3 certificates specified as PKCS#11 URIs.
.sp
.LP
Normally, each user wishing to use \fBSSH\fR with \fBRSA\fR or \fBDSA\fR authentication runs this once to create the authentication key in \fB$HOME/.ssh/identity\fR, \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa\fR, or \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa\fR. The system administrator can also use this to generate host keys..
.sp
.LP
Ordinarily, this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to store the private key. The public key is stored in a file with the same name but with the ``\fB\&.pub\fR'' extension appended. The program also asks for a passphrase. The passphrase can be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have empty passphrases), or it can be a string of arbitrary length. Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or otherwise easy to guess, and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per word and provides very poor passphrases.) If a passphrase is set, it must be at least 4 characters long.
.sp
.LP
The passphrase can be changed later by using the \fB-p\fR option.
.sp
.LP
There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, you have to generate a new key and copy the corresponding public key to other machines.
.sp
.LP
For \fBRSA\fR, there is also a comment field in the key file that is only for convenience to the user to help identify the key. The \fIcomment\fR can tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful. The comment is initialized to ``\fBuser@host\fR'' when the key is created, but can be changed using the \fB-c\fR option.
.sp
.LP
After a key is generated, instructions below detail where to place the keys to activate them.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fIbits\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. The minimum number is 512 bits. Generally, 2048 bits is considered sufficient. Key sizes above that no longer improve security but make things slower. The default is 2048 bits.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-B\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Requests changing the comment in the private and public key files. The program prompts for the file containing the private keys, for the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.
.sp
This option only applies to \fBrsa1\fR (\fBSSHv1\fR) keys.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-e\fR\fR

.RS 21n
.rt  
This option reads a private or public OpenSSH key file and prints the key in a "SECSH" Public Key File Format to stdout. This option allows exporting keys for use by several other SSH implementations.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR

.RS 21n
.rt  
Specifies the filename of the key file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Search for the specified \fIhostname\fR in a \fBknown_hosts\fR file, listing any occurrences found. This option is useful to find hashed host names or addresses and can also be used in conjunction with the \fB-H\fR option to print found keys in a hashed format.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
Hash a \fBknown_hosts\fR file. This replaces all host names and addresses with hashed representations within the specified file. The original content is moved to a file with a \fB\&.old\fR suffix. These hashes may be used normally by \fBssh\fR and \fBsshd\fR, but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents be disclosed. This option does not modify existing hashed host names and is therefore safe to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 21n
.rt  
This option reads an unencrypted private (or public) key file in SSH2-compatible format and prints an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout. \fBssh-keygen\fR also reads the "SECSH" Public Key File Format. This option allows importing keys from several other SSH implementations.
.RE

\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
