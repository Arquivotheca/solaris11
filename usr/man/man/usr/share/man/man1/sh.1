.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR utility is a command programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sh\fR utility is a standards compliant shell. This utility provides all the functionality of \fBksh88\fR(1), except in cases discussed in \fBksh88\fR(1) where differences in behavior exist.
.sp
.LP
The \fBjsh\fR utility is an interface to the shell that provides all of the functionality of \fBsh\fR and enables job control (see \fBJob Control\fR section below).
.sp
.LP
Arguments to the shell are listed in the \fBInvocation\fR section below.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A \fIblank\fR is a tab or a space. A \fIname\fR is a sequence of \fBASCII\fR letters, digits, or underscores, beginning with a letter or an underscore. A \fIparameter\fR is a name, a digit, or any of the characters \fB*\fR, \fB@\fR, \fB#\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB\(mi\fR, \fB$\fR, and \fB!\fR.
.SH USAGE
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A \fIsimple-command\fR is a sequence of non-blank \fIword\fRs separated by \fIblank\fRs. The first \fIword\fR specifies the name of the command to be executed. Except as specified below, the remaining \fIword\fRs are passed as arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0 (see \fBexec\fR(2)). The \fIvalue\fR of a \fIsimple-command\fR is its exit status if it terminates normally, or (octal) \fB200\fR+\fIstatus\fR if it terminates abnormally. See \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD) for a list of status values.
.sp
.LP
A \fIpipeline\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIcommand\fRs separated by \fB|\fR. The standard output of each \fIcommand\fR but the last is connected by a \fBpipe\fR(2) to the standard input of the next \fIcommand\fR. Each \fIcommand\fR is run as a separate process. The shell waits for the last \fIcommand\fR to terminate. The exit status of a \fIpipeline\fR is the exit status of the last command in the \fIpipeline\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIlist\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIpipeline\fRs separated by \fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, \fB&&\fR, or \fB|\||\fR, and optionally terminated by \fB;\fR or \fB&\fR\&. Of these four symbols, \fB;\fR and \fB&\fR have equal precedence, which is lower than that of \fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR. The symbols \fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR also have equal precedence. A semicolon (\fB;\fR) causes sequential execution of the preceding \fIpipeline\fR, that is, the shell waits for the \fIpipeline\fR to finish before executing any commands following the semicolon. An ampersand (\fB&\fR) causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline, that is, the shell does \fBnot\fR wait for that pipeline to finish. The symbol \fB&&\fR (\|\fB|\||\fR) causes the \fIlist\fR following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns a zero (non-zero) exit status. An arbitrary number of newlines can appear in a \fIlist\fR, instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is either a \fIsimple-command\fR or one of the following. Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last \fIsimple-command\fR executed in the command.
.sp

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Each time a \fBfor\fR command is executed, \fIname\fR is set to the next \fIword\fR taken from the \fBin\fR \fIword\fR list. If \fBin\fR \fIword\fR .\|.\|. is omitted, then the \fBfor\fR command executes the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR once for each positional parameter that is set (see \fBParameter Substitution\fR section below). Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBcase\fR command executes the \fIlist\fR associated with the first \fIpattern\fR that matches \fIword\fR. The form of the patterns is the same as that used for file-name generation (see \fBFile Name Generation\fR section), except that a slash, a leading dot, or a dot immediately following a slash need not be matched explicitly.

.sp
.LP
The \fIlist\fR following \fBif\fR is executed and, if it returns a zero exit status, the \fIlist\fR following the first \fBthen\fR is executed. Otherwise, the \fIlist\fR following \fBelif\fR is executed and, if its value is zero, the \fIlist\fR following the next \fBthen\fR is executed. Failing that, the \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR is executed. If no \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR or \fBthen\fR \fIlist\fR is executed, then the \fBif\fR command returns a zero exit status.

\fB\fBwhile\fR \fIlist\fR \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR \fBdone\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
A \fBwhile\fR command repeatedly executes the \fBwhile\fR \fIlist\fR and, if the exit status of the last command in the list is zero, executes the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR; otherwise the loop terminates. If no commands in the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR are executed, then the \fBwhile\fR command returns a zero exit status; \fBuntil\fR can be used in place of \fBwhile\fR to negate the loop termination test.

Execution of functions is described below (see \fBExecution\fR section). The \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR are unnecessary if the body of the function is a \fIcommand\fR as defined above, under \fBCommands\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following words are only recognized as the first word of a command and when not quoted:
.sp
.LP
\fBif  then  else  elif  fi  case  esac  for  while  until  do  done  {  }\fR
.SS "Comments Lines"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with \fB#\fR causes that word and all the following characters up to a newline to be ignored.
.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The shell reads commands from the string between two grave accents (\fB``\fR) and the standard output from these commands can be used as all or part of a word. Trailing newlines from the standard output are removed.
.sp
.LP
No interpretation is done on the string before the string is read, except to remove backslashes (\fB\e\fR) used to escape other characters. Backslashes can be used to escape a grave accent (\fB`\fR) or another backslash (\fB\e\fR) and are removed before the command string is read. Escaping grave accents allows nested command substitution. If the command substitution lies within a pair of double quotes (\fB" .\|.\|.\|` .\|.\|.\|` .\|.\|.\| "\fR), a backslash used to escape a double quote (\fB\e"\fR) is removed. Otherwise, it is left intact.
.sp
.LP
If a backslash is used to escape a newline character (\fB\enewline\fR), both the backslash and the newline are removed (see the later section on \fBQuoting\fR). In addition, backslashes used to escape dollar signs (\fB\e$\fR) are removed. Since no parameter substitution is done on the command string before it is read, inserting a backslash to escape a dollar sign has no effect. Backslashes that precede characters other than \fB\e\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB"\fR, \fBnewline\fR, and \fB$\fR are left intact when the command string is read.
.SS "Parameter Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The character \fB$\fR is used to introduce substitutable \fIparameter\fRs. There are two types of parameters, positional and keyword. If \fIparameter\fR is a digit, it is a positional parameter. Positional parameters can be assigned values by \fBset\fR. Keyword parameters (also known as variables) can be assigned values by writing:
.sp
.LP
\fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR [ \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR ] .\|.\|.
.sp
.LP
Pattern-matching is not performed on \fIvalue\fR. There cannot be a function and a variable with the same \fIname\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB${\fR\fIparameter\fR\fB}\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt  
The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted. The braces are required only when \fIparameter\fR is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted as part of its name. If \fIparameter\fR is \fB*\fR or \fB@\fR, all the positional parameters, starting with \fB$1\fR, are substituted (separated by spaces). Parameter \fB$0\fR is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked.

If any of the above is preceded by a digit, the file descriptor which is associated with the file is that specified by the digit (instead of the default \fB0\fR or \fB1\fR). For example:
.sp

.nf
\fB\&... 2>&1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
associates file descriptor 2 with the file currently associated with file descriptor 1.
.sp
.LP
The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell evaluates redirections left-to-right. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB\&... 1>\fIxxx\fR 2>&1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file \fIxxx\fR. It associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is, \fIxxx\fR). If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and file descriptor 1 would be associated with file \fIxxx\fR.
.sp
.LP
Using the terminology introduced on the first page, under \fBCommands\fR, if a \fIcommand\fR is composed of several \fIsimple commands\fR, redirection is evaluated for the entire \fIcommand\fR before it is evaluated for each \fIsimple command\fR. That is, the shell evaluates redirection for the entire \fIlist\fR, then each \fIpipeline\fR within the \fIlist\fR, then each \fIcommand\fR within each \fIpipeline\fR, then each \fIlist\fR within each \fIcommand\fR.
.sp

If a command is followed by \fB&\fR, the default standard input for the command is the empty file, \fB/dev/null\fR. Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input/output specifications.
.SS "File Name Generation"
.sp
.LP
Before a command is executed, each command \fIword\fR is scanned for the characters \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR, and \fB[\fR. If one of these characters appears the word is regarded as a \fIpattern\fR.

.SS "Quoting"
.sp
.LP
The following characters have a special meaning to the shell and cause termination of a word unless quoted:
.sp
.LP
\fB;  &  (  )  |  ^  <  >  newline  space  tab\fR
.sp
.LP
A character can be \fIquoted\fR (that is, made to stand for itself) by preceding it with a backslash (\fB\e\fR) or inserting it between a pair of quote marks (\fB\|'\|'\fR or \fB""\fR). During processing, the shell can quote certain characters to prevent them from taking on a special meaning. Backslashes used to quote a single character are removed from the word before the command is executed. The pair \fB\enewline\fR is removed from a word before command and parameter substitution.
.sp
.LP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quote marks (\fB\|'\|'\fR), except a single quote, are quoted by the shell. Backslash has no special meaning inside a pair of single quotes. A single quote can be quoted inside a pair of double quote marks (for example, \fB"\|'"\fR), but a single quote can not be quoted inside a pair of single quotes.
.sp
.LP
Inside a pair of double quote marks (\fB""\fR), parameter and command substitution occurs and the shell quotes the results to avoid blank interpretation and file name generation. If \fB$*\fR is within a pair of double quotes, the positional parameters are substituted and quoted, separated by quoted spaces (\fB"$1 \|$2\fR \|.\|.\|.\fB"\fR). However, if \fB$@\fR is within a pair of double quotes, the positional parameters are substituted and quoted, separated by unquoted spaces (\fB"$1"\|"$2"\fR \| .\|.\|. ). \fB\e\fR quotes the characters \fB\e\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB,\fR (comma), and \fB$\fR. The pair \fB\enewline\fR is removed before parameter and command substitution. If a backslash precedes characters other than \fB\e\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB,\fR (comma), \fB$\fR, and newline, then the backslash itself is quoted by the shell.
.SS "Prompting"
.sp
.LP
When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of \fBPS1\fR before reading a command. If at any time a newline is typed and further input is needed to complete a command, the secondary prompt (that is, the value of \fBPS2\fR) is issued.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The \fIenvironment\fR (see \fBenviron\fR(5)) is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument list. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a parameter for each name found, giving it the corresponding value. If the user modifies the value of any of these parameters or creates new parameters, none of these affects the environment unless the \fBexport\fR command is used to bind the shell's parameter to the environment (see also \fBset\fR \fB-a\fR). A parameter can be removed from the environment with the \fBunset\fR command. The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any unmodified name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, minus any pairs removed by \fBunset\fR, plus any modifications or additions, all of which must be noted in \fBexport\fR commands.
.sp
.LP
The environment for any \fIsimple-command\fR can be augmented by prefixing it with one or more assignments to parameters. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBTERM=450  \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB(export TERM; TERM=450;   \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
are equivalent as far as the execution of \fIcommand\fR is concerned if \fIcommand\fR is not a Special Command. If \fIcommand\fR is a Special Command, then
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBTERM=450   \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
modifies the \fBTERM\fR variable in the current shell.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-k\fR flag is set, \fIall\fR keyword arguments are placed in the environment, even if they occur after the command name. The following example first prints \fBa=b c\fR and \fBc\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBecho a=b  c

a=b  c

set  \(mik

echo a=b  c

c\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Signals"
.sp
.LP
The \fBINTERRUPT\fR and \fBQUIT\fR signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by \fB&\fR\&. Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its parent, with the exception of signal 11 (but see also the \fBtrap\fR command below).
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is executed, the command substitution, parameter substitution, blank interpretation, input/output redirection, and filename generation listed above are carried out. If the command name matches the name of a defined function, the function is executed in the shell process (note how this differs from the execution of shell script files, which require a sub-shell for invocation). If the command name does not match the name of a defined function, but matches one of the \fBSpecial Commands\fR listed below, it is executed in the shell process.
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR, .\|.\|. are set to the arguments of the function. If the command name matches neither a \fBSpecial Command\fR nor the name of a defined function, a new process is created and an attempt is made to execute the command via \fBexec\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The shell parameter \fBPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fB/usr/bin\fR. The current directory is specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal sign, between two colon delimiters anywhere in the path list, or at the end of the path list. If the command name contains a \fB/\fR the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an executable file. If the file has execute permission but is not an \fBa.out\fR file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A sub-shell is spawned to read it. A parenthesized command is also executed in a sub-shell.
.sp
.LP
The location in the search path where a command was found is remembered by the shell (to help avoid unnecessary \fIexec\fRs later). If the command was found in a relative directory, its location must be re-determined whenever the current directory changes. The shell forgets all remembered locations whenever the \fBPATH\fR variable is changed or the \fBhash\fR \fB-r\fR command is executed (see below).
.SS "Special Commands"
.sp
.LP
Input/output redirection is now permitted for these commands. File descriptor 1 is the default output location. When Job Control is enabled, additional \fBSpecial Commands\fR are added to the shell's environment (see \fBJob Control\fR section below).

In this case, TERMINATE is ignored (so that \fBkill 0\fR does not kill an interactive shell) and INTERRUPT is caught and ignored (so that \fBwait\fR is interruptible). In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.

.SS "Job Control (jsh)"
.sp
.LP
When the shell is invoked as \fBjsh\fR, Job Control is enabled in addition to all of the functionality described previously for \fBsh\fR. Typically, Job Control is enabled for the interactive shell only. Non-interactive shells typically do not benefit from the added functionality of Job Control.
.sp
.LP
With Job Control enabled, every command or pipeline the user enters at the terminal is called a \fIjob\fR. All jobs exist in one of the following states: foreground, background, or stopped. These terms are defined as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
A job in the foreground has read and write access to the controlling terminal.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
A job in the background is denied read access and has conditional write access to the controlling terminal (see \fBstty\fR(1)).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
A stopped job is a job that has been placed in a suspended state, usually as a result of a \fBSIGTSTP\fR signal (see \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD)).
.RE
.sp
.LP
Every job that the shell starts is assigned a positive integer, called a \fIjob number\fR which is tracked by the shell and is used as an identifier to indicate a specific job. Additionally, the shell keeps track of the \fIcurrent\fR and \fIprevious\fR jobs. The \fIcurrent job\fR is the most recent job to be started or restarted. The \fIprevious job\fR is the first non-current job.
.sp
.LP
The acceptable syntax for a Job Identifier is of the form:
.sp
.LP
\fB%\fR\fIjobid\fR
.sp

where \fIjobid\fR can be specified in any of the following formats:
.sp

See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBsh\fR and \fBjsh\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to return a non-zero exit status. If the shell is being used non-interactively execution of the shell file is abandoned. Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of the last command executed (see also the \fBexit\fR command above).
.SS "jsh Only"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked as \fBjsh\fR and an attempt is made to exit the shell while there are stopped jobs, the shell issues one warning:
.sp
.LP
\fBThere are stopped jobs.\fR
.sp
.LP
This is the only message. If another exit attempt is made, and there are still stopped jobs they are sent a \fBSIGHUP\fR signal from the kernel and the shell is exited.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Words used for filenames in input/output redirection are not interpreted for filename generation (see \fBFile Name Generation\fR section above). For example, \fBcat file1 >a*\fR createsa file named \fBa*\fR.
.sp
.LP
Because commands in pipelines are run as separate processes, variables set in a pipeline have no effect on the parent shell.
.sp
.LP
If the input or the output of a \fBwhile\fR or \fBuntil\fR loop is redirected, the commands in the loop are run in a sub-shell, and variables set or changed there have no effect on the parent process:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   lastline=
   while read line
   do

           lastline=$line
   done < /etc/passwd
   echo "lastline=$lastline"       # lastline is empty!
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In these cases, the input or output can be redirected by using \fBexec\fR, as in the following example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   # Save standard input (file descriptor 0) as file
   # descriptor 3, and redirect standard input from the file
   /etc/passwd:

   exec 3<&0               # save standard input as fd 3
   exec </etc/passwd       # redirect input from file

   lastline=
   while read line
   do
           lastline=$line
   done

   exec 0<&3               # restore standard input
   exec 3<&-               # close file descriptor 3
   echo "$lastline"        # lastline
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
If you get the error message, "\fBcannot fork, too many processes\fR", try using the \fBwait\fR(1) command to clean up your background processes. If this doesn't help, the system process table is probably full or you have too many active foreground processes. There is a limit to the number of process ids associated with your login, and to the number the system can keep track of.
.sp
.LP
Only the last process in a pipeline can be waited for.
.sp
.LP
If a command is executed, and a command with the same name is installed in a directory in the search path before the directory where the original command was found, the shell continues to \fBexec\fR the original command. Use the \fBhash\fR command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
The Bourne shell has a limitation on the effective \fBUID\fR for a process. If this \fBUID\fR is less than 100 (and not equal to the real UID of the process), then the \fBUID\fR is reset to the real UID of the process.
.sp
.LP
Because the shell implements both foreground and background jobs in the same process group, they all receive the same signals, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It is, therefore, recommended that other job control shells be used, especially in an interactive environment.
.sp
.LP
When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to execute a non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns an erroneous diagnostic message that the shell script file does not exist.
