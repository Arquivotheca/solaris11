.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBman\fR command displays information from the reference manuals. It displays complete manual pages that you select by \fIname\fR, or one-line summaries selected either by \fIkeyword\fR or \fIstring\fR (\fB-k\fR or \fB-K\fR), or by the name of an associated file (\fB-f\fR). If no manual page is located, \fBman\fR prints an error message.
.SS "Source Format"
.sp
.LP
Reference Manual pages are marked up with either \fBnroff\fR (see \fBnroff\fR(1)) or \fBSGML\fR (Standard Generalized Markup Language) tags (see \fBsgml\fR(5)). The \fBman\fR command recognizes the type of markup and processes the file accordingly. The various source files are kept in separate directories depending on the type of markup.
.SS "Location of Manual Pages"
.sp
.LP
The online Reference Manual page directories are conventionally located in \fB/usr/share/man\fR. The \fBnroff\fR sources are located in the \fB/usr/share/man/man\fR* directories. The \fBSGML\fR sources are located in the \fB/usr/share/man/sman\fR* directories. Each directory corresponds to a section of the manual. Since these directories are optionally installed, they might not reside on your host. You might have to mount \fB/usr/share/man\fR from a host on which they do reside.
.sp
.LP
If there are preformatted, up-to-date versions in the corresponding \fBcat\fR* or \fBfmt\fR* directories, \fBman\fR simply displays or prints those versions. If the preformatted version of interest is out of date or missing, \fBman\fR reformats it prior to display and stores the preformatted version if \fBcat\fR* or \fBfmt\fR* is writable. The index files are not updated. See \fBcatman\fR(1M). If directories for the preformatted versions are not provided, \fBman\fR reformats a page whenever it is requested. \fBman\fR uses a temporary file to store the formatted text during display.
.sp
.LP
If the standard output is not a terminal, or if the `\fB-\fR' flag is given, \fBman\fR pipes its output through \fBcat\fR(1). Otherwise, \fBman\fR pipes its output through \fBmore\fR(1) to handle paging and underlining on the screen.
.SS "Query Strings"
.sp
.LP
Using \fB-k\fR or \fB-K\fR options, manual pages can be searched with keywords or query strings. It supports index file-based full text searching, stemming, and section matching. For information regarding how to generate the index files, refer to \fBcatman\fR(1M) and \fBman\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
Stemming for English, for example, identifies the string \fBcats\fR, \fBcatlike\fR, \fBcatty\fR, and so forth, based on the root \fBcat\fR. It identifies \fBstemmer\fR, \fBstemming\fR, and \fBstemmed\fR based on \fBstem\fR. A stemming algorithm reduces the words \fBfishing\fR,  \fBfished\fR, \fBfish\fR, and \fBfisher\fRto the root word, \fBfish\fR.
.sp
.LP
Matching is done in case-insensitive manner. Stemming is done for English manual pages only.
.sp
.LP
Matched manual pages are sorted and presented based on the frequency of the query string matches, and, in the case of multiple matches, the shortest distances between the matches.
.sp
.LP
Oracle Solaris manual pages are divided into sections such as \fBNAME\fR, \fBSYNOPSIS\fR, \fBDESCRIPTION\fR, and so forth. Users can specify the scope of search into a section as details described in the \fB-K\fR option.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Shows all manual pages matching \fIname\fR within the \fBMANPATH\fR search path. Manual pages are displayed in the order found.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Debugs. Displays what a section-specifier evaluates to, method used for searching, and paths searched by \fBman\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfile ...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
\fBman\fR attempts to locate manual pages related to any of the given \fIfile\fRs. It strips the leading path name components from each \fIfile\fR, and then prints one-line summaries containing the resulting basename or names. 
.sp
This option uses the index files. Refer to \fBcatman\fR(1M) and \fBman\fR(5) for details on how index files are generated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Forces \fBman\fR to search all directories specified by \fBMANPATH\fR or the \fBman.cf\fR file, rather than using the index lookup files. This option is useful if the index files are not up to date and they have been made the default behavior of the \fBman\fR command. The option therefore does not have to be invoked and is documented here for reference only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIkeyword ...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Prints out one-line summaries from the index files. 
.sp
See the \fB-K\fR option for information regarding how the index files are generated. If there are no index files, manual page files are directly looked up, therefore yielding slower response time than cases where index files exist.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-K\fR \fIstring ...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Search for the specified string from the index files. If there are no index files, search is directly done on the manual page files which cause much slower search.
.sp
If you supply a section name ending with a colon (\fB:\fR) at the string option argument as the first text from left, as in \fI"section name: query string"\fR, the search for the query string   is done on the specified section only. If the specified section name does not exist, it is ignored and the search is done on entire manual pages.
.sp
The index files used by \fB-f\fR, \fB-k\fR, or \fB-K\fR are either automatically generated by an SMF service during installation of the man page packages specified with \fBrestart_fmli\fR actuator as specified \fBman\fR(5) or  manually using \fBcatman\fR(1M) with the \fB-w\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Lists all manual pages found matching \fIname\fR within the search path.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR \fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies an alternate search path for manual pages. \fIpath\fR is a colon-separated list of directories that contain manual page directory subtrees. For example, if \fIpath\fR is \fB/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man\fR, \fBman\fR searches for \fIname\fR in the standard location, and then \fB/usr/local/man\fR. When used with the \fB-f\fR, \fB-k\fR or \fB-K\fR options, the \fB-M\fR option must appear first. Each directory in the \fIpath\fR is assumed to contain subdirectories of the form \fBman\fR* or \fBsman\fR* , one for each section. This option overrides the \fBMANPATH\fR environment variable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Reformats the manual page, but does not display it. This replaces the \fBman\fR \fB-\fR \fB-t\fR \fIname\fR combination.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIsection ...\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Specifies sections of the manual for \fBman\fR to search. The directories searched for \fIname\fR are limited to those specified by \fIsection\fR. \fIsection\fR can be a numerical digit, perhaps followed by one or more letters to match the desired section of the manual, for example, "\fB3lib\fR". Also, \fIsection\fR can be a word, for example, \fBlocal\fR, \fBnew\fR, \fBold\fR, \fBpublic\fR. \fIsection\fR can also be a letter. To specify multiple sections, separate each section with a comma. This option overrides the \fBMANPATH\fR environment variable and the \fBman.cf\fR file. See \fBSearch\fR \fBPath\fR below for an explanation of how \fBman\fR conducts its search.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
\fBman\fR arranges for the specified manual pages to be \fBtroff\fRed to a suitable raster output device (see \fBtroff\fR(1)). If both the \fB-\fR and \fB-t\fR flags are given, \fBman\fR updates the \fBtroff\fRed versions of each named \fIname\fR (if necessary), but does not display them.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fImacro-package\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Formats manual pages using \fImacro-package\fR rather than the standard \fB-man\fR macros defined in \fB/usr/share/lib/tmac/an\fR. See \fBSearch Path\fR under USAGE for a complete explanation of the default search path order.

The usage of \fBman\fR is described below:
.SS "Manual Page Sections"
.sp
.LP
Entries in the reference manuals are organized into \fIsection\fRs. A section name consists of a major section name, typically a single digit, optionally followed by a subsection name, typically one or more letters. An unadorned major section name, for example, "\fB9\fR", does not act as an abbreviation for the subsections of that name, such as "\fB9e\fR", "\fB9f\fR", or "\fB9s\fR". That is, each subsection must be searched separately by \fBman\fR \fB-s\fR. Each section contains descriptions apropos to a particular reference category, with subsections refining these distinctions. See the \fBintro\fR manual pages for an explanation of the classification used in this release.

.SS "Search Path"
.sp
.LP
Before searching for a given \fIname\fR, \fBman\fR constructs a list of candidate directories and sections. \fBman\fR searches for \fIname\fR in the directories specified by the \fBMANPATH\fR environment variable.
.sp
.LP
In the absence of \fBMANPATH\fR, \fBman\fR constructs its search path based upon the \fBPATH\fR environment variable, primarily by substituting \fBman\fR for the last component of the \fBPATH\fR element. Special provisions are added to account for unique characteristics of directories such as \fB/sbin\fR, \fB/usr/ucb\fR, \fB/usr/xpg4/bin\fR, and others. If the file argument contains a \fB/\fR character, the \fIdirname\fR portion of the argument is used in place of \fBPATH\fR elements to construct the search path.
.sp
.LP
Within the manual page directories, \fBman\fR confines its search to the sections specified in the following order:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o

.RE
.sp
.LP
If none of the above exist, \fBman\fR searches each directory in the manual page path, and displays the first matching manual page found.
.sp
.LP
The \fBman.cf\fR file has the following format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
MANSECTS=\fIsection\fR[,\fIsection\fR]... 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Lines beginning with `\fB#\fR' and blank lines are considered comments, and are ignored. Each directory specified in \fBMANPATH\fR can contain a manual page configuration file, specifying the default search order for that directory.
.SH FORMATTING MANUAL PAGES
.sp
.LP
Manual pages are marked up in \fBnroff\fR(1) or \fBsgml\fR(5). \fBnroff\fR manual pages are processed by \fBnroff\fR(1) or \fBtroff\fR(1) with the \fB-man\fR macro package. Please refer to \fBman\fR(5) for information on macro usage. \fBSGML\fR\(emtagged manual pages are processed by an \fBSGML\fR parser and passed to the formatter.
.SS "Preprocessing \fBnroff\fR Manual Pages"
.sp
.LP
When formatting an \fBnroff\fR manual page, \fBman\fR examines the first line to determine whether it requires special processing. If the first line is a string of the form:
.sp

.nf
\&'\e" \fIX\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIX\fR is separated from the `\fB"\fR' by a single SPACE and consists of any combination of characters in the following list, \fBman\fR pipes its input to \fBtroff\fR(1) or \fBnroff\fR(1) through the corresponding preprocessors.

If \fBeqn\fR or \fBneqn\fR is invoked, it automatically reads the file \fB/usr/pub/eqnchar\fR (see \fBeqnchar\fR(5)). If \fBnroff\fR(1) is invoked, \fBcol\fR(1) is automatically used.
.SS "Referring to Other \fBnroff\fR Manual Pages"

.sp
.in +2
.nf

.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fBman\fR processes the indicated file in place of the current one. The reference must be expressed as a path name relative to the root of the manual page directory subtree.
.sp
.LP
When the second or any subsequent line starts with \fB\&.so\fR, \fBman\fR ignores it; \fBtroff\fR(1) or \fBnroff\fR(1) processes the request in the usual manner.
.SS "Processing SGML Manual Pages"
.sp
.LP
Manual pages are identified as being marked up in SGML by the presence of the string \fB<!DOCTYPE\fR\&. If the file also contains the string \fBSHADOW_PAGE\fR, the file refers to another manual page for the content. The reference is made with a file entity reference to the manual page that contains the text. This is similar to the \fB\&.so\fR mechanism used in the \fBnroff\fR formatted manual pages.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.sp
.LP
The \fB-f\fR, \fB-k\fR, and \fB-K\fR options use the index files which are created by the SMF service as specified in \fBman\fR(5), or by manually using \fBcatman\fR(1M) with the \fB-w\fR option.

.LP
The \fBwindex\fR database file is no longer used. The \fBwindex\fR database file has replaced with the new index files. 
.sp
.LP
The \fBman\fR command is CSI-capable. However, some utilities invoked by the \fBman\fR command, namely, \fBtroff\fR, \fBeqn\fR, \fBneqn\fR, \fBrefer\fR, \fBtbl\fR, and \fBvgrind\fR, are not verified to be CSI-capable. Because of this, the \fBman\fR command with the \fB-t\fR option can not handle non-EUC data. Also, using the \fBman\fR command to display manual pages that require special processing through \fBeqn\fR, \fBneqn\fR, \fBrefer\fR, \fBtbl\fR, or \fBvgrind\fR can not be CSI-capable.

The manual is supposed to be reproducible either on a phototypesetter or on an \fBASCII\fR terminal. However, on a terminal some information (indicated by font changes, for instance) is lost.

Some dumb terminals cannot process the vertical motions produced by the \fBe\fR (see \fBeqn\fR(1)) preprocessing flag. To prevent garbled output on these terminals, when you use \fBe\fR, also use \fBt\fR, to invoke \fBcol\fR(1) implicitly. This workaround has the disadvantage of eliminating superscripts and subscripts, even on those terminals that can display them. Control-q clears a terminal that gets confused by \fBeqn\fR(1) output.
