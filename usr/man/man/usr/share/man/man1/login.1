.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlogin\fR command is used at the beginning of each terminal session to identify oneself to the system. \fBlogin\fR is invoked by the system when a connection is first established, after the previous user has terminated the login shell by issuing the \fBexit\fR command.
.sp
.LP
Login cannot be invoked as a command, except by the superuser.
.sp
.LP
If \fBlogin\fR is invoked as a command, it must replace the initial command interpreter. To invoke \fBlogin\fR in this fashion, type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexec login\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
from the initial shell. The C shell and Korn shell have their own built-ins of \fBlogin\fR. See \fBksh\fR(1), \fBksh88\fR(1), and \fBcsh\fR(1) for descriptions of login built-ins and usage.
.sp
.LP
\fBlogin\fR asks for your user name, if it is not supplied as an argument, and your password, if appropriate. Where possible, echoing is turned off while you type your password, so it does not appear on the written record of the session.
.sp
.LP
If you make any mistake in the login procedure, the message:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Login incorrect
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
is printed and a new login prompt appears. If you make five incorrect login attempts, all five can be logged in \fB/var/adm/loginlog\fR, if it exists. The \fBTTY\fR line is dropped.
.sp
.LP
If password aging is turned on and the password has aged (see \fBpasswd\fR(1) for more information), the user is forced to change the password. In this case the \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file is consulted to determine password repositories (see \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4)). The password update configurations supported are limited to the following five cases.
.RS +4

.el o

.RE
.sp
.LP
Failure to comply with the configurations prevents the user from logging onto the system because \fBpasswd\fR(1) fails. If you do not complete the login successfully within a certain period of time, it is likely that you are silently disconnected.
.sp
.LP
After a successful login, accounting files are updated. Device owner, group, and permissions are set according to the contents of the \fB/etc/logindevperm\fR file, and the time you last logged in is printed (see \fBlogindevperm\fR(4)).
.sp
.LP
The user-ID, group-ID, supplementary group list, and working directory are initialized, and the command interpreter (usually \fBksh88\fR) is started.
.sp
.LP
The basic \fIenvironment\fR is initialized to:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
HOME=\fIyour-login-directory\fR
LOGNAME=\fIyour-login-name\fR
PATH=/usr/bin:
SHELL=\fIlast-field-of-passwd-entry\fR
MAIL=/var/mail/
TZ=\fItimezone-specification\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For Bourne shell and Korn shell logins, the shell executes \fB/etc/profile\fR and \fB$HOME/.profile\fR, if it exists.
.sp
.LP
For the \fBksh\fR Korn shell, an interactive shell then executes \fB/etc/ksh.kshrc\fR, followed by the file specified by the \fBENV\fR environment variable. If \fB$ENV\fR is not set, this defaults to \fB$HOME/.kshrc\fR. For the \fBksh88\fR and \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sh\fR Korn Shell, an interactive shell executes the file named by \fB$ENV\fR (no default). 
.sp
.LP
For C shell logins, the shell executes \fB/etc/.login\fR, \fB$HOME/.cshrc\fR, and \fB$HOME/.login\fR. The default \fB/etc/profile\fR and \fB/etc/.login\fR files check quotas (see \fBquota\fR(1M)), print \fB/etc/motd\fR, and check for mail. None of the messages are printed if the file \fB$HOME/.hushlogin\fR exists. The name of the command interpreter is set to \fB\(mi\fR (dash), followed by the last component of the interpreter's path name, for example, \fB\(mish\fR\&.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIlogin-shell\fR field in the password file (see \fBpasswd\fR(4)) is empty, then the default command interpreter, \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR, is used. If this field is * (asterisk), then the named directory becomes the root directory. At that point, \fBlogin\fR is re-executed at the new level, which must have its own root structure.
.sp
.LP
The environment can be expanded or modified by supplying additional arguments to \fBlogin\fR, either at execution time or when \fBlogin\fR requests your login name. The arguments can take either the form \fIxxx\fR or \fIxxx=yyy\fR. Arguments without an \fB=\fR (equal sign) are placed in the environment as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
L\fIn=xxx\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIn\fR is a number starting at \fB0\fR and is incremented each time a new variable name is required. Variables containing an \fB=\fR (equal sign) are placed in the environment without modification. If they already appear in the environment, then they replace the older values.
.sp
.LP
There are two exceptions: The variables \fBPATH\fR and \fBSHELL\fR cannot be changed. This prevents people logged into restricted shell environments from spawning secondary shells that are not restricted. \fBlogin\fR understands simple single-character quoting conventions. Typing a \fB\e\fR\| (backslash) in front of a character quotes it and allows the inclusion of such characters as spaces and tabs.
.sp
.LP
Alternatively, you can pass the current environment by supplying the \fB-p\fR flag to \fBlogin\fR. This flag indicates that all currently defined environment variables should be passed, if possible, to the new environment. This option does not bypass any environment variable restrictions mentioned above. Environment variables specified on the login line take precedence, if a variable is passed by both methods.
.sp
.LP
To enable remote logins by root, edit the \fB/etc/default/login\fR file by inserting a \fB#\fR (pound sign) before the \fBCONSOLE=/dev/console\fR entry. See FILES.
.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
For accounts in name services which support automatic account locking, the account can be configured to be automatically locked (see \fBuser_attr\fR(4) and \fBpolicy.conf\fR(4)) if successive failed login attempts equals or exceeds \fBRETRIES\fR. Currently, only the files repository (see \fBpasswd\fR(4) and \fBshadow\fR(4)) supports automatic account locking. See also \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The \fBlogin\fR command uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management, session management, and password management. The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBlogin\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for the \fBlogin\fR command using the UNIX authentication, account management, and session management modules:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
login  auth       required  pam_authtok_get.so.1
login  auth       required  pam_dhkeys.so.1
login  auth       required  pam_unix_auth.so.1
login  auth       required  pam_dial_auth.so.1

login  account    requisite pam_roles.so.1
login  account    required  pam_unix_account.so.1

login  session    required  pam_unix_session.so.1
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The Password Management stack looks like the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
other  password   required   pam_dhkeys.so.1
other  password   requisite  pam_authtok_get.so.1
other  password   requisite  pam_authtok_check.so.1
other  password   required   pam_authtok_store.so.1
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If there are no entries for the service, then the entries for the \fBother\fR service is used. If multiple authentication modules are listed, then the user can be prompted for multiple passwords.
.sp
.LP
When \fBlogin\fR is invoked through \fBrlogind\fR or \fBtelnetd\fR, the service name used by \fBPAM\fR is \fBrlogin\fR or \fBtelnet\fR, respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdevice\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 26n
.rt  
\fBlogin\fR accepts a device option, \fIdevice\fR. \fIdevice\fR is taken to be the path name of the \fBTTY\fR port \fBlogin\fR is to operate on. The use of the device option can be expected to improve \fBlogin\fR performance, since \fBlogin\fR does not need to call \fBttyname\fR(3C). The \fB-d\fR option is available only to users whose \fBUID\fR and effective \fBUID\fR are root. Any other attempt to use \fB-d\fR causes \fBlogin\fR to quietly exit.

Indicates the name of the person attempting to login on the remote side of the rlogin connection. When \fBin.rlogind\fR(1M) is operating in Kerberized mode, that daemon processes the terminal and remote user name information prior to invoking \fBlogin\fR, so the "\fBruser\fR" data is indicated using this command line parameter. Normally (non-Kerberos authenticated \fBrlogin\fR), the \fBlogin\fR daemon reads the remote user information from the client.
