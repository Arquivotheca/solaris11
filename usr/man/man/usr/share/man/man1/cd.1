.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "/usr/bin/cd"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/cd\fR utility changes the current directory in the context of the \fBcd\fR utility only. This is in contrast to the version built into the shell. \fB/usr/bin/cd\fR has no effect on the invoking process but can be used to determine whether or not a given directory can be set as the current directory.
.SS "sh"
.sp
.LP
The Bourne shell built-in \fBcd\fR changes the current directory to \fIargument\fR. The shell parameter \fBHOME\fR is the default \fIargument\fR. The shell parameter \fBCDPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing \fIargument\fR. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fB<null>\fR (specifying the current directory). The current directory is specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If \fIargument\fR begins with `\fB/\fR', `\fB\&.\fR', or `\fB\&.\|.\fR', the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for \fIargument\fR. \fBcd\fR must have execute (search) permission in \fIargument\fR. Because a new process is created to execute each command, \fBcd\fR would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command; therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to the shell. (See \fBpwd\fR(1), \fBsh\fR(1), and \fBchdir\fR(2)).
.sp
.LP
\fBchdir\fR is just another way to call \fBcd\fR.
.SS "csh"
.sp
.LP
If \fIdir\fR is not specified, the C shell built-in \fBcd\fR uses the value of shell parameter \fBHOME\fR as the new working directory. If \fIdir\fR specifies a complete path starting with `\fB/\fR', `\fB\&.\fR', or `\fB\&.\|.\fR', \fIdir\fR becomes the new working directory. If neither case applies, \fBcd\fR tries to find the designated directory relative to one of the paths specified by the \fBCDPATH\fR shell variable. \fBCDPATH\fR has the same syntax as, and similar semantics to, the \fBPATH\fR shell variable. \fBcd\fR must have execute (search) permission in \fIdir\fR. Because a new process is created to execute each command, \fBcd\fR would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command; therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to the C-shell. (See \fBpwd\fR(1), \fBsh\fR(1), and \fBchdir\fR(2)).
.sp
.LP
\fBchdir\fR changes the shell's working directory to directory \fIdir\fR. If no argument is given, change to the home directory of the user. If \fIdir\fR is a relative pathname not found in the current directory, check for it in those directories listed in the \fBcdpath\fR variable. If \fIdir\fR is the name of a shell variable whose value starts with a \fB/\fR, change to the directory named by that value.
.sp
.LP
\fBpushd\fR pushes a directory onto the directory stack. With no arguments, exchange the top two elements.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB+\fR\fIn\fR\fR

Rotate the \fIn\fR'th entry to the top of the stack and \fBcd\fR to it.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIdir\fR\fR
.ad

Push the current working directory onto the stack and change to \fIdir\fR.

.LP
\fBpopd\fR pops the directory stack and \fBcd\fR to the new top directory. The elements of the directory stack are numbered from 0 starting at the top.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Discard the \fIn\fR'th entry in the stack.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fBdirs\fR prints the directory stack, most recent to the left; the first directory shown is the current directory. With the \fB-l\fR argument, produce an unabbreviated printout; use of the \fB~\fR notation is suppressed.
.SS "ksh88, ksh"
.sp
.LP
The Korn shell built-in \fBcd\fR command can be in either of two forms. In the first form it changes the current directory to \fIarg\fR. If \fIarg\fR is \fB\(mi\fR the directory is changed to the previous directory. The shell variable \fBHOME\fR is the default \fIarg\fR. The environment variable \fBPWD\fR is set to the current directory. If the \fBPWD\fR is changed, the \fBOLDPWD\fR environment variable shall also be changed to the value of the old working directory, that is, the current working directory immediately prior to the call to change directory (\fBcd\fR). The shell variable \fBCDPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing \fIarg\fR. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fBnull\fR (specifying the current directory). The current directory is specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If \fIarg\fR begins with a `\fB/\fR', `\fB\&.\fR', or `\fB\&.\|.\fR', then the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for \fIarg\fR. If unsuccessful, \fBcd\fR attempts to change directories to the pathname formed by the concatenation of the value of PWD, a slash character, and arg.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Handles the operation dot-dot (\fB\&..\fR) logically. Symbolic link components are \fBnot\fR resolved before dot-dot components are processed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Handles the operand dot-dot physically. Symbolic link components \fBare\fR resolved before dot-dot components are processed.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If both \fB-L\fR and \fB-P\fR options are specified, the last option to be invoked is used and the other is ignored. If neither \fB-L\fR nor \fB-P\fR is specified, the operand is handled dot-dot logically.
.sp
.LP
The second form of \fBcd\fR substitutes the string \fInew\fR for the string \fIold\fR in the current directory name, \fBPWD\fR and tries to change to this new directory.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcd\fR command cannot be executed by \fBrksh\fR. Because a new process is created to execute each command, \fBcd\fR would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command; therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to the Korn shell. (See \fBpwd\fR(1), \fBsh\fR(1), and \fBchdir\fR(2)).
.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdirectory\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that becomes the new working directory. The interpretation of a relative pathname by \fBcd\fR depends on the \fBCDPATH\fR environment variable.
.RE

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
.LP
If a non-empty directory name from \fBCDPATH\fR is used, an absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output as follows:
.sp
.LP
\fB"%s\en"\fR, <\fInew directory\fR>
.sp
.LP
Otherwise, there is no output.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBcd\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBCDPATH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A colon-separated list of pathnames that refer to directories. If the \fIdirectory\fR operand does not begin with a slash \fB(\fR \fB/\fR \fB)\fR character, and the first component is not dot or dot-dot, \fBcd\fR searches for \fIdirectory\fR relative to each directory named in the \fBCDPATH\fR variable, in the order listed. The new working directory sets to the first matching directory found. An empty string in place of a directory pathname represents the current directory. If \fBCDPATH\fR is not set, it is treated as if it were an empty string.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBHOME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
The name of the home directory, used when no \fIdirectory\fR operand is specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBOLDPWD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A pathname of the previous working directory, used by \fBcd-\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBPWD\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A pathname of the current working directory, set by \fBcd\fR after it has changed to that directory.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned by \fBcd\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
The directory was successfully changed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR

.RS 6n
.rt  
An error occurred.
