.SH NAME
kpasswd \- change a user's Kerberos password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/kpasswd\fR [\fIprincipal\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBkpasswd\fR command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password. \fBkpasswd\fR prompts for the current Kerberos password, which is used to obtain a \fBchangepw\fR ticket from the \fBKDC\fR for the user's Kerberos realm. If \fBkpasswd\fR successfully obtains the \fBchangepw\fR ticket, the user is prompted twice for the new password, and the password is changed.
.sp
.LP
If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies the length and/or number of character classes required in the new password, the new password must conform to the policy. (The five character classes are lower case, upper case, numbers, punctuation, and all other characters.)
