.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcrontab\fR utility manages a user's access with \fBcron\fR (see \fBcron\fR(1M)) by copying, creating, listing, and removing \fBcrontab\fR files. If invoked without options, \fBcrontab\fR copies the specified file, or the standard input if no file is specified, into a directory that holds all users' crontabs.
.sp
.LP
If \fBcrontab\fR is invoked with \fIfilename\fR, this overwrites an existing \fBcrontab\fR entry for the user that invokes it.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Access Control"

if Solaris Auditing is enabled, the user's shell is not audited and the user is not the \fBcrontab\fR owner. This can occur if the user logs in by way of a program, such as some versions of \fBSSH\fR, which does not set audit parameters.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The rules for \fBallow\fR and \fBdeny\fR apply to \fBroot\fR only if the \fBallow\fR/\fBdeny\fR files exist.
.sp
.LP
The \fBallow\fR/\fBdeny\fR files consist of one user name per line.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Entry Format"
.sp
.LP
A \fBcrontab\fR file consists of lines of six fields each. The fields are separated by spaces or tabs. The first five are integer patterns that specify the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
minute (0\(mi59),
hour (0\(mi23),
day of the month (1\(mi31),
month of the year (1\(mi12),
day of the week (0\(mi6 with 0=Sunday).
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Each of these patterns can be either an asterisk (meaning all legal values) or a list of elements separated by commas. An element is either a number or two numbers separated by a minus sign (meaning an inclusive range). Time specified here is interpreted in the currently active timezone. At the top of the crontab file this is the timezone which is set system-wide in /etc/default/init. A user can add a line such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=\fItimezone\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...and all subsequent entries will be interpreted using that timezone, until a new \fBTZ=\fR\fItimezone\fR line is encountered. The specification of days can be made by two fields (day of the month and day of the week). Both are adhered to if specified as a list of elements. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR.
.sp
.LP
The sixth field of a line in a \fBcrontab\fR file is a string that is executed by the shell at the specified times. A percent character in this field (unless escaped by \fB\e\fR\|) is translated to a \fINEWLINE\fR character.
.sp
.LP
Only the first line (up to a \fB`\|%\|'\fR or end of line) of the command field is executed by the shell. Other lines are made available to the command as standard input. Any blank line or line beginning with a \fB`\|#\|'\fR is a comment and is ignored.
.sp
.LP
The shell is invoked from your $HOME directory. As with $TZ, both $SHELL and $HOME can be set by having a line such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
SHELL=/usr/bin/\fIsomeshell\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...or:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
HOME=\fIsomedirectory\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...which will take precedence for all the remaining entries in the \fBcrontab\fR or until there is another \fBHOME\fR or \fBSHELL\fR entry. It is invoked with an \fBarg0\fR of the basename of the $SHELL that is currently in effect. A user who wants to have his \fB\&.profile\fR or equivalent file executed must  explicitly do so in the \fBcrontab\fR file. \fBcron\fR supplies a default environment for every shell, defining HOME, LOGNAME, SHELL, TZ, and PATH. The default PATH for user \fBcron\fR jobs is \fB/usr/bin\fR; while root \fBcron\fR jobs default to \fB/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\fR. The default PATH can be set in \fB/etc/default/cron\fR (see \fBcron\fR(1M)). The TZ, HOME, and SHELL environment variables are set to match those that are in effect in the \fBcrontab\fR file at the time.
.sp
.LP
If you do not redirect the standard output and standard error of your commands, any generated output or errors are mailed to you.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Environment Variables"
.sp
.LP
The following variables are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBHOME\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows the user to choose and alternative directory for cron to change directory to prior to running the command. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
HOME=/var/tmp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBSHELL\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The name of the shell to use to run subsequent commands. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
SHELL=/usr/bin/ksh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBTZ\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows the user to choose the timezone in which the \fBcron\fR entries are run. This effects both the environment of the command that is run and the timing of the entry. For example, to have your entries run using the timezone for Iceland, use:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=Iceland
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
Each of these variables affects all of the lines that follow it in the \fBcrontab\fR file, until it is reset by a subsequent line resetting that variable. Hence, it is possible to have multiple timezones supported within a single \fBcrontab\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The lines that are not setting these environment variables are  the same as crontab entries that conform to the UNIX standard and are described elsewhere in this man page.
.SS "Setting \fBcron\fR Jobs Across Timezones"
.sp
.LP
The default timezone of the \fBcron\fR daemon sets the system-wide timezone for \fBcron\fR entries. This, in turn, is by set by default system-wide using \fB/etc/default/init\fR. 
.sp
.LP
If some form of \fBdaylight savings\fR or \fBsummer/winter time\fR is in effect, then jobs scheduled during the switchover period could be executed once, twice, or not at all.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Edits a copy of the current user's \fBcrontab\fR file, or creates an empty file to edit if \fBcrontab\fR does not exist. When editing is complete, the file is installed as the user's \fBcrontab\fR file. 
.sp
The environment variable \fBEDITOR\fR determines which editor is invoked with the \fB-e\fR option. All \fBcrontab\fR jobs should be submitted using \fBcrontab\fR. Do not add jobs by just editing the \fBcrontab\fR file, because \fBcron\fR is not aware of changes made this way.
.sp
If all lines in the \fBcrontab\fR file are deleted, the old \fBcrontab\fR file is restored. The correct way to delete all lines is to remove the \fBcrontab\fR file using the \fB-r\fR option.
.sp
If \fIusername\fR is specified, the specified user's \fBcrontab\fR file is edited, rather than the current user's \fBcrontab\fR file. This can only be done by root or by a user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Lists the \fBcrontab\fR file for the invoking user. Only root or a user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization can specify a username following the \fB-l\fR option to list the \fBcrontab\fR file of the specified user. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Removes a user's \fBcrontab\fR from the \fBcrontab\fR directory. Only root or a user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization can specify a username following the \fB-r\fR option to remove the \fBcrontab\fR file of the specified user.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRCleaning up Core Files
.sp
.LP
This example cleans up \fBcore\fR files every weekday morning at 3:15 am:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
15 3 * * 1-5 find $HOME -name core 2>/dev/null | xargs rm \fB-f\fR 
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRMailing a Birthday Greeting
.sp
.LP
This example mails a birthday greeting:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
0 12 14 2 * mailx john%Happy Birthday!%Time for lunch.
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRSpecifying Days of the Month and Week
.sp
.LP
This example runs a command on the first and fifteenth of each month, as well as on every Monday:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
0 0 1,15 * 1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To specify days by only one field, the other field should be set to *. For example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
0 0 * * 1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
would run a command only on Mondays.

.LP
\fBExample 4 \fRUsing Environment Variables
.sp
.LP
The following entries take advantage of \fBcrontab\fR support for certain environment variables.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=GMT
HOME=/local/home/user
SHELL=/usr/bin/ksh
0 0 * * * echo $(date) >        midnight.GMT
TZ=PST
0 0 * * * echo $(date) >        midnight.PST
TZ=EST
HOME=/local/home/myuser
SHELL=/bin/csh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The preceding entries allow two jobs to run. The first one would run at midnight in the GMT timezone and the second would run at midnight in the PST timezone. Both would be run in the directory \fB/local/home/user\fR using the Korn shell. The file concludes with \fBTZ\fR, \fBHOME\fR, and \fBSHELL\fR entries that return those variable to their default values.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If you inadvertently enter the \fBcrontab\fR command with no arguments, do not attempt to get out with Control-d. This removes all entries in your \fBcrontab\fR file. Instead, exit with Control-c.
.sp
.LP
When updating \fBcron\fR, check first for existing \fBcrontab\fR entries that can be scheduled close to the time of the update. Such entries can be lost if the update process completes after the scheduled event. This can happen because, when \fBcron\fR is notified by \fBcrontab\fR to update the internal view of a user's \fBcrontab\fR file, it first removes the user's existing internal \fBcrontab\fR and any internal scheduled events. Then it reads the new \fBcrontab\fR file and rebuilds the internal \fBcrontab\fR and events. This last step takes time, especially with a large \fBcrontab\fR file, and can complete \fBafter\fR an existing \fBcrontab\fR entry is scheduled to run if it is scheduled too close to the update. To be safe, start a new job at least 60 seconds after the current date and time.
.sp
.LP
Simultaneous modifications of the same crontab file may lead to unexpected results.
.sp
.LP
Care should be taken when adding \fBTZ\fR, \fBSHELL\fR and \fBHOME\fR variables to the \fBcrontab\fR  file when the \fBcrontab\fR file could be shared with applications that do not expect those variables to be changed from the default. Resetting the values to their defaults at the bottom of the file will minimize the risk of problems.
