.TH strip 1 "8 Jun 2011" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
strip \- strip symbol table, debugging and line number information from an object file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBstrip\fR [\fB-lVx\fR] \fIfile\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrip\fR command removes the symbol table \fBSHT_SYMTAB\fR and its associated string table, debugging information, and line number information from \fBELF\fR object files. That is, besides the symbol table and associated string table, the following sections are removed:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&.line
\&.debug*
\&.stab*
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Once this stripping process has been done, limited symbolic debugging access is available for that file. Therefore, this command is normally run only on production modules that have been debugged and tested.
.sp
.LP
If \fBstrip\fR is executed on a common archive file (see \fBar.h\fR(3HEAD)) in addition to processing the members, \fBstrip\fR removes the archive symbol table. The archive symbol table must be restored by executing the \fBar\fR(1) command with the \fB-s\fR option before the archive can be linked by the \fBld\fR(1) command. \fBstrip\fR produces appropriate warning messages when this situation arises.
.sp
.LP
\fBstrip\fR is used to reduce the file storage overhead taken by the object file.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The amount of information stripped from the  \fBELF\fR object file can be controlled by using any of the following options. The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2

.LP
The symbol table section is not removed if it is contained within a segment or if the file is a relocatable object.
.sp

The line number and debugging sections are not removed if they are contained within a segment or if their associated relocation section is contained within a segment.

The \fBstrip\fR command is used to remove a standard predefined set of sections from an ELF object file. To remove a user specified section by name, see \fBmcs\fR(1).
