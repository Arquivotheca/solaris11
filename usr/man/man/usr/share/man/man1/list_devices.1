.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlist_devices\fR utility lists the allocatable devices in the system according to specified qualifications.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdevice\fR and all device special files associated with the device are listed. The device argument is optional and, if it is not present, all relevant devices are listed. If \fIdev-class\fR is present, devices belonging to the specified \fIdev-class\fR are listed. There is no default \fIdev-class\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

.rt  
Lists the pathnames of the device special files associated with the \fIdevice\fR that are allocatable to the current process. 
.sp
If \fIdev-class\fR is specified, lists only the files associated with all devices of the specified device class.

\fB\fB-U\fR \fIuid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 30n
.rt  
Uses the user \fBID\fR \fIuid\fR instead of the real user \fBID\fR of the current process when performing the \fBlist_devices\fR operation. Only a user with the \fBsolaris.device.revoke\fR authorization can use this option.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following options are supported when the system is configured with Trusted Extensions:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Lists attributes like authorizations, cleaning programs and labels associated with a device.
.sp
The list is a single line of semicolon (\fB;\fR) separated \fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR pairs for each device in the format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
device=\fIdevice-name\fR;type=\fIdevice-type\fR;\e
auths=\fIauths\fR;clean=\fIdevice-exec\fR;\e
\fIdevice-attributes\fR;\e
files=\fIdevice-list\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

where \fIdevice-attributes\fR is the contents of the \fBreserved1\fR field of \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4). The field is colon (\fB:\fR) separated.) 
.sp
See \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4) for a description of these attributes and their format.
.sp
The \fB-a\fR output has the following keys:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBauths\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Specifies the list of authorizations. The value is \fBauths\fR is described in \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBclean\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Specifies the device cleaning script. The value is \fBdevice-exec\fR as described in \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBdevice\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Specifies the device name. The value is \fBdevice-name\fR as described in \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBfiles\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Specifies the device file paths. The value is \fBdevice-list\fR as described in \fBdevice_maps\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBtype\fR\fR

.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Displays the system-supplied default attributes for the device types managed by device allocation. If \fIdev-type\fR is specified, it lists the default attributes for only that device type.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
This option can be used with \fB-a\fR to list the current owner of the device as the key value pair \fIowner\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR. \fIvalue\fR is the \fBuid\fR of the current owner of the device. If the device is unallocated, value is \fB/FREE\fR. If the device is in error state, value is \fB/ERROR\fR. This option also suppresses any diagnostic output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzonename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
When specified with the \fB-l\fR option, lists only those non-allocated devices whose label range includes the label of the zonename, and of the allocated devices, only those that are allocated at the same label as that of \fIzonename\fR.
.sp
When specified with the \fB-n\fR option, lists only those non-allocated devices whose label range includes the label of the \fIzonename\fR.
.sp
When specified with the \fB-u\fR option, lists only those devices that are allocated at the same label as that of \fIzonename\fR.
