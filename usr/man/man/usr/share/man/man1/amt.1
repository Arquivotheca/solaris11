.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBamt\fR command is for use in a Common Criteria security certified system. The command is used to verify that the low level functions necessary to enforce the object reuse requirements of the Controlled Access Protection Profile are working correctly. \fB/usr/bin/amt\fR is a shell script that executes tests specific to your system. For a 32-bit system, the tests run as a 32-bit application. For a 64-bit system, the tests run twice; once as a 32-bit application and once as a 64-bit application.
.sp
.LP
\fBamt\fR lists test results with a \fBpass\fR or \fBfail\fR for each test it performs, unless output is suppressed with the \fB-s\fR option.
