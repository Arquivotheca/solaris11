.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBFile \fIfilename\fR not found, or no read permission\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The input file you specified does not exist, or you do not have read permission. Check with the SunOS command, \fBls\fR \fB-l\fR (see \fBls\fR(1)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBBad output filename \fIfilename\fR, or no write permission\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The output file you specified is either invalid, or you do not have write permission for that file or the directory that contains it. Check also that the drive is not write-protected.

.mk
.na
\fB\fBError while writing to temporary file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An error occurred while converting your file, possibly because there is not enough space on the current drive. Check the amount of space on the current drive using the \fBDIR\fR command. Also be certain that the default drive is write-enabled (not write-protected). When this error occurs, the original file remains intact.
