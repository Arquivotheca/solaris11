.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBdc\fR is an arbitrary precision arithmetic package. Ordinarily it operates on decimal integers, but one may specify an input base, output base, and a number of fractional digits to be maintained. The overall structure of \fBdc\fR is a stacking (reverse Polish) calculator. If an argument is given, input is taken from that file until its end, then from the standard input.
.sp
.LP
\fBbc\fR is a preprocessor for \fBdc\fR that provides infix notation and a C-like syntax that implements functions. \fBbc\fR also provides reasonable control structures for programs. See \fBbc\fR(1).

The value of the number is pushed on the stack. A number is an  unbroken string of the digits 0\(mi9. It may be preceded by an underscore (\fB_\fR) to input a negative number. Numbers may  contain decimal points.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBs\fR\fIx\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The top of the stack is popped and stored into a register named \fIx\fR, where \fIx\fR may be any character.  If the \fBs\fR is capitalized, \fIx\fR is treated as a stack and the value is pushed on it.
.RE

.ne 2

.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
The value in register \fIx\fR is pushed on the stack. The register \fIx\fR is not altered. All registers start with zero value.  If the \fBl\fR is capitalized, register \fIx\fR is treated as a stack and its top value is popped onto the main stack.

The top of the stack is popped, and that value is used as a  non-negative scale factor: the appropriate number of places are  printed on output, and maintained during multiplication, division,  and exponentiation.  The interaction of scale factor, input base, and  output base will be reasonable if all are changed together.

The two entries are popped off the stack; the result is pushed on the stack in their place. Any fractional part of an exponent is ignored.
