.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvgrind\fR utility formats the program sources named by the \fIfilename\fR arguments in a nice style using \fBtroff\fR(1). Comments are placed in italics, keywords in bold face, and as each function is encountered its name is listed on the page margin.
.sp
.LP
\fBvgrind\fR runs in two basic modes, filter mode or regular mode. In filter mode, \fBvgrind\fR acts as a filter in a manner similar to \fBtbl\fR(1). The standard input is passed directly to the standard output except for lines bracketed by the \fBtroff\fR-like macros:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\&.vS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
starts processing
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB\&.vE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
ends processing
.RE

.sp
.LP
These lines are formatted as described above. The output from this filter can be passed to \fBtroff\fR for output. There need be no particular ordering with \fBeqn\fR(1) or \fBtbl\fR(1).
.sp
.LP
In regular mode, \fBvgrind\fR accepts input \fIfilename\fRs, processes them, and passes them to \fBtroff\fR for output. Use a hyphen (`\fB\(mi\fR\&') to specify standard input; otherwise, \fBvgrind\fR will exit without attempting to read from the standard input. Filenames must be specified after all other option arguments.
.sp
.LP
In regular mode, if the \fB-t\fR or \fB-P\fR option is specified, the output is:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
emitted (in \fBtroff\fR format) to stdout if the \fB-t\fR option is specified.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
printed (as PostScript) to the named printer if the \fB-P\fR option is specified.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Otherwise, the output is:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
printed (as PostScript) on the system default printer, if one is defined, and the command's stdout is a tty.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
emitted (as PostScript) to stdout if it is not a tty (that is, if stdout is a pipe or a redirect to a file).
.RE
.sp
.LP
In both modes, \fBvgrind\fR passes any lines beginning with a decimal point without conversion.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Produces two-column output. Specifying this option changes the default point size to 8 (as if the \fB-s8\fR option were supplied). It also arranges for output to appear in landscape mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Forces filter mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Does not make keywords boldface.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Considers TAB characters to be spaced four columns apart instead of the usual eight.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Outputs the index file in a "pretty" format. The index file itself is produced whenever \fBvgrind\fR is run with a file called \fBindex\fR that is present in the current directory. The index of function definitions can then be run off by giving \fBvgrind\fR the \fB-x\fR option and the file \fBindex\fR as argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdefs-file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies an alternate language definitions file (default is \fB/usr/lib/vgrindefs\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fIheader\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies a header to appear in the center of every output page. Use quotes to specify headers with embedded spaces.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIlanguage\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies the language to use. Among the \fIlanguage\fRs currently known are: Bourne shell (\fB-lsh\fR), C (\fB-lc\fR, the default), C++ (\fB-lc++\fR), C shell (\fB-lcsh\fR), emacs MLisp (\fB-lml\fR), FORTRAN (\fB-lf\fR), Icon (\fB-lI\fR), ISP (\fB-i\fR), LDL (\fB-lLDL\fR), Model (\fB-lm\fR), Pascal (\fB-lp\fR), and RATFOR (\fB-lr\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIprinter\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Sends output to the named \fIprinter\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIn\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies a point size to use on output (exactly the same as the argument of a \fBtroff\fR \fB\&.ps\fR point size request).
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fBvgrind\fR passes the following options to the formatter specified by the \fBTROFF\fR environment variable. See ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Similar to the same option in \fBtroff\fR; that is, formatted text goes to the standard output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIpagelist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Prints only those pages whose page numbers appear in the comma-separated \fIpagelist\fR of numbers and ranges. A range \fIN\(miM\fR means pages \fIN\fR through \fIM\fR; an initial \fB-N\fR means from the beginning to page \fIN\fR; and a final \fIN\fR\(mi means from \fIN\fR to the end.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fIoutput-device\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
.rt  
Formats output for the specified \fIoutput-device\fR.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
Name of the program source to be processed by \fBvgrind\fR. Use `\fB\(mi\fR\&' to specify the standard input.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
In regular mode, \fBvgrind\fR feeds its intermediate output to the text formatter given by the value of the \fBTROFF\fR environment variable, or to \fB/usr/bin/troff\fR if this variable is not defined in the environment. This mechanism allows for local variations in \fBtroff\fR's name.

.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
\fBvgrind\fR assumes that a certain programming style is followed:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBC\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Function names can be preceded on a line only by SPACE, TAB, or an asterisk (\fB*\fR). The parenthesized arguments must also be on the same line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBFORTRAN\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords \fBfunction\fR or \fBsubroutine\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBMLisp\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Function names should not appear on the same line as the preceding \fBdefun\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBModel\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords \fBis beginproc\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPascal\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords \fBfunction\fR or \fBprocedure\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If these conventions are not followed, the indexing and marginal function name comment mechanisms will fail.
.sp
.LP
More generally, arbitrary formatting styles for programs usually give unsightly results. To prepare a program for \fBvgrind\fR output, use TAB rather than SPACE characters to align source code properly, since \fBvgrind\fR uses variable width fonts.
.sp
.LP
The mechanism of \fBctags\fR(1) in recognizing functions should be used here.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-w\fR option is annoying, but there is no other way to achieve the desired effect.
.sp
.LP
The macros defined in \fBtmac.vgrind\fR do not coexist gracefully with those of other macro packages, making filter mode difficult to use effectively.
.sp
.LP
\fBvgrind\fR does not process certain special characters in \fBcsh\fR(1) scripts correctly.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmac.vgrind\fR formatting macros wire in the page height and width used in two-column mode, effectively making two column output useless for paper sizes other than the standard American size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. For other paper sizes, it is necessary to edit the size values given in \fBtmac.vgrind\fR. A better solution would be to create a \fBtroff\fR output device specification intended specifically for landscape output and record size information there.
