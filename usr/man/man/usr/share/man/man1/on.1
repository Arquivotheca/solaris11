.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBon\fR program is used to execute commands on another system, in an environment similar to that invoking the program. All environment variables are passed and the current working directory is preserved. To preserve the working directory, the working file system must be either already mounted on the host or be exported to it. Relative path names will only work if they are within the current file system. Absolute path names may cause problems.
.sp
.LP
The standard input is connected to the standard input of the remote command. The standard output and the standard error from the remote command are sent to the corresponding files for the \fBon\fR command.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Debug mode. Prints out some messages as work is being done.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Interactive mode. Uses remote echoing and special character processing. This option is needed for programs that expect to be talking to a terminal. All terminal modes and window size changes are propagated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
No Input. This option causes the remote program to get EOF when it reads from the standard input, instead of passing the standard input from the standard input of the \fBon\fR program. For example, \fB-n\fR is necessary when running commands in the background with job control.

\fB\fBRPC: Authentication error\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6

The server requires \fBDES\fR authentication and you  do not have a secret key registered with keyserv. Perhaps you logged in without a password. Try to keylogin.  If that fails, try to set your publickey with chkey.
