.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBrenice\fR command alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. By default, the processes to be affected are specified by their process \fBID\fRs.
.sp
.LP
If the first operand is a number within the valid range of priorities (\fB\(mi20\fR to \fB20\fR), \fBrenice\fR will treat it as a \fIpriority\fR (as in all but the first synopsis form). Otherwise, \fBrenice\fR will treat it as an \fIID\fR (as in the first synopsis form).
.SS "Altering Process Priority"
.sp
.LP
Users other than the privileged user may only alter the priority of processes they own, and can only monotonically increase their "nice value" within the range \fB0\fR to \fB19\fR. This prevents overriding administrative fiats. The privileged user may alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in the range \fB\(mi20\fR to \fB19\fR. Useful priorities are: \fB19\fR (the affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants to); \fB0\fR (the "base" scheduling priority),; and any negative value (to make things go very fast). \fB20\fR is an acceptable nice value, but will be rounded down to \fB19\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
\fBrenice\fR supports the following option features:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The first operand, \fIpriority\fR, must precede the options and can have the appearance of a multi-digit option.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The \fB-g\fR, \fB-p\fR, and \fB-u\fR options can each take multiple option-arguments.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The \fIpid\fR option-argument can be used without its \fB-p\fR option.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The \fB-i\fR option can be used to specify the \fIID\fR type for the \fBID\fR list. This is preferred in specifying \fIID\fR type over the use of the \fB-g\fR | \fB-p\fR | \fB-u\fR syntax, which is now obsolete. See NOTES.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Interprets all operands or just the \fIgid\fR arguments as unsigned decimal integer process group IDs.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
This option, together with the \fIID\fR list arguments, specifies a class of processes to which the \fBrenice\fR command is to apply. The interpretation of the \fBID\fR list depends on the value of \fIidtype\fR. The valid \fIidtype\fR arguments are: \fBpid\fR, \fBpgid\fR, \fBuid\fR, \fBgid\fR, \fBsid\fR, \fBtaskid\fR, \fBprojid\fR, and \fBzoneid\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIincrement\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Specifies how the system scheduling priority of the specified process or processes is to be adjusted. The \fIincrement\fR option-argument is a positive or negative decimal integer that will be used to modify the system scheduling priority of the specified process or processes. Positive \fIincrement\fR values cause a lower system scheduling priority. Negative \fIincrement\fR values may require appropriate privileges and will cause a higher system scheduling priority.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Interprets all operands or just the \fIpid\fR arguments as unsigned decimal integer process \fBID\fRs. The \fB-p\fR option is the default if no options are specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Interprets all operands or just the \fIuser\fR argument as users. If a user exists with a user name equal to the operand, then the user \fBID\fR of that user will be used in further processing. Otherwise, if the operand represents an unsigned decimal integer, it will be used as the numeric user \fBID\fR of the user.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
A process \fBID\fR, process group \fBID\fR, or user name/user \fBID\fR, depending on the option selected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpriority\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
.rt  
The value specified is taken as the actual system scheduling priority, rather than as an increment to the existing system scheduling priority. Specifying a scheduling priority higher than that of the existing process may require appropriate privileges.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRAdjusting the scheduling priority of process IDs
.sp
.LP
Adjust the system scheduling priority so that process \fBID\fRs \fB987\fR and \fB32\fR would have a lower scheduling priority:

.sp

.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRAdjusting the scheduling priority of group IDs
.sp
.LP
Adjust the system scheduling priority so that group \fBID\fRs \fB324\fR and \fB76\fR would have a higher scheduling priority, if the user has the appropriate privileges to do so:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBrenice -n -4 -g 324 76\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRAdjusting the scheduling priority of a user ID and user name

.sp
.LP
If you make the priority very negative, then the process cannot be interrupted.
.sp
.LP
To regain control you must make the priority greater than \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
Users other than the privileged user cannot increase scheduling priorities of their own processes, even if they were the ones that decreased the priorities in the first place.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpriocntl\fR command subsumes the function of \fBrenice\fR.
