.TH builtin 1 "1 May 2007" "SunOS 5.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
builtin \- ksh built-in function to add, delete, or display shell built-ins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBbuiltin\fR [\fB-ds\fR] [\fB-f\fR \fIlib\fR] [\fIpathname\fR ...]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBksh\fR \fBbuiltin\fR command adds, deletes, or displays built-in commands in the current shell environment. A built-in command executes in the current shell process and can have side effects in the current shell. On most systems, the invocation time for built-in commands is one or two orders of magnitude less than commands that create a separate process.
.sp
.LP
For each \fIpathname\fR specified, the basename of the pathname determines the name of the built-in. For each basename, the shell looks for a C level function in the current shell whose name is determined by pre-pending \fBb_\fR to the built-in name. If \fIpathname\fR contains a forward slash (\fB/\fR), the built-in is bound to \fIpathname\fR. A built-in bound to a pathname is only executed if \fIpathname\fR is the first executable found during a path search. Otherwise, built-ins are found prior to performing the path search. 
.sp
.LP
If \fIpathname\fR is not specified, \fBbuiltin\fR displays the current list of built-ins, or just the special built-ins if the \fB-s\fR option is specified, on standard output. The full pathname for built-ins that are bound to pathnames are displayed. 
.sp
.LP
Libraries containing built-ins can be specified with the \fB-f\fR option. If the library contains a function named \fBlib_init()\fR, this function is invoked with argument \fB0\fR when the library is loaded. The \fBlib_init()\fR function can load built-ins by invoking an appropriate C level function. In this case there is no restriction on the C level function name.
.sp
.LP
The C level function is invoked with three arguments. The first two are the same as \fBmain()\fR and the third one is a pointer.
.sp
.LP
The \fBksh\fR \fBbuiltin\fR command cannot be invoked from a restricted shell. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Delete each of the specified built-ins. Special built-ins cannot be deleted.
.RE

\fB\fB-f\fR \fIlib\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
On systems with dynamic linking, load and search for built-ins in the shared library, \fIlib\fR. 
.sp
Libraries are searched for in \fB$PATH\fR and system dependent library directories. The system dependent shared library prefix or suffix can be omitted. Once a library is loaded, its symbols become available for the current and subsequent invocations of \fBbuiltin\fR. Multiple libraries can be specified with separate invocations of \fBbuiltin\fR. Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which they are specified.
