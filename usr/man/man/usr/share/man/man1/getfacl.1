.SH NAME
getfacl \- display discretionary file information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBgetfacl\fR [\fB-ad\fR] \fIfile\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
For each argument that is a regular file, special file, or named pipe, the \fBgetfacl\fR utility displays the owner, the group, and the Access Control List (\fBACL\fR). For each directory argument, \fBgetfacl\fR displays the owner, the group, and the \fBACL\fR and/or the default \fBACL\fR. Only directories contain default \fBACL\fRs.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetfacl\fR utility may be executed on a file system that does not support \fBACL\fRs. It reports the \fBACL\fR based on the base permission bits.
.sp
.LP
With no options specified, \fBgetfacl\fR displays the filename, the file owner, the file group owner, and both the \fBACL\fR and the default \fBACL\fR, if it exists.
.SH OPTIONS

.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
.LP
The format for \fBACL\fR output is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# file: filename	
# owner: uid	
# group: gid	
user::perm	
user:uid:perm	
group::perm	
group:gid:perm	
mask:perm	
other:perm	
default:user::perm	
default:user:uid:perm	
default:group::perm	
default:group:gid:perm	
default:mask:perm	
default:other:perm
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When multiple files are specified on the command line, a blank line separates the \fBACL\fRs for each file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBACL\fR entries are displayed in the order in which they are evaluated when an access check is performed. The default \fBACL\fR entries that may exist on a directory have no effect on access checks.
.sp
.LP
The first three lines display the filename, the file owner, and the file group owner. Notice that when only the \fB-d\fR option is specified and the file has no default \fBACL\fR, only these three lines are displayed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBuser\fR entry without a user \fBID\fR indicates the permissions that  are granted to the file owner. One or more additional user entries indicate the permissions that are granted to the specified users.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgroup\fR entry without a group \fBID\fR indicates the permissions that  are granted to the file group owner. One or more additional group entries indicate the permissions that  are granted to the specified groups.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmask\fR entry indicates the \fBACL\fR mask permissions. These are the maximum permissions allowed to any user entries except the file owner, and to any group entries, including the file group owner. These permissions restrict the permissions specified in other entries.
.sp
.LP
The \fBother\fR entry indicates the permissions that are granted to others.
.sp
.LP
The \fBdefault\fR entries may exist only for directories. These entries indicate the default entries that are added to a file created within the directory.
.sp
.LP
The \fBuid\fR is a login name or a user \fBID\fR if there is no entry for the \fBuid\fR in the system password file, \fB/etc/passwd\fR. The \fBgid\fR is a group name or a group \fBID\fR if there is no entry for the \fBgid\fR in the system group file, \fB/etc/group\fR. The \fBperm\fR is a three character string composed of the letters representing the separate discretionary access rights: \fBr\fR (read), \fBw\fR (write), \fBx\fR (execute/search), or the place holder character \fB\(mi\fR\&. The \fBperm\fR is displayed in the following order: \fBrwx\fR. If a permission is not granted by an \fBACL\fR entry, the place holder character appears.
.sp
.LP
If  you use the \fBchmod\fR(1) command to change the file group owner permissions on a file with \fBACL\fR entries, both the file group owner permissions and the \fBACL\fR mask are changed to the new permissions. Be aware that the new \fBACL\fR mask permissions may change the effective permissions for additional users and groups who have \fBACL\fR entries on the file. 
.sp
.LP
In order to indicate that the \fBACL\fR mask  restricts an \fBACL\fR entry, \fBgetfacl\fR displays an additional tab character, pound sign (\fB#\fR), and the actual permissions granted, following the entry.
.SH EXAMPLES

host% \fBgetfacl -d doo\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

would print:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The output from \fBgetfacl\fR is in the correct format for input to the \fBsetfacl\fR \fB-f\fR command. If the output from \fBgetfacl\fR is redirected to a file, the file may be used as input to \fBsetfacl\fR. In this way, a user may easily assign one file's \fBACL\fR to another file.
