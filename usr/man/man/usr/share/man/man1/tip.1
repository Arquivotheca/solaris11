.SH NAME
tip \- connect to remote system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBtip\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-speed-entry\fR] {\fIhostname\fR | \fIphone-number\fR | \fIdevice\fR}
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtip\fR utility establishes a full-duplex terminal connection to a remote host. Once the connection is established, a remote session using  \fBtip\fR behaves like an interactive session on a local terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fBremote\fR file contains entries describing remote systems and line speeds used by \fBtip\fR.
.sp
.LP
Each host has a default baud rate for the connection, or you can specify a speed with the \fB-\fR\fIspeed-entry\fR command line argument.
.sp
.LP
When \fIphone-number\fR is specified, \fBtip\fR looks for an entry in the \fBremote\fR file of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
tip -\fIspeed-entry\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
When \fBtip\fR finds such an entry, it sets the connection speed accordingly. If it finds no such entry, \fBtip\fR interprets \fB-\fR\fIspeed-entry\fR as if it were a system name, resulting in an error message.
.sp
.LP
If you omit \fB-\fR\fIspeed-entry\fR, \fBtip\fR uses the \fBtip0\fR entry to set a speed for the connection.
.sp
.LP
When \fIdevice\fR is specified, \fBtip\fR attempts to open that device, but will do so using the access privileges of the user, rather than \fBtip\fR's usual access privileges (\fBsetuid uucp\fR). The user must have read/write access to the device. The \fBtip\fR utility interprets any character string beginning with the slash character (\|\fB/\fR\|) as a device name.
.sp
.LP
When establishing the connection, \fBtip\fR sends a connection message to the remote system. The default value for this message can be found in the \fBremote\fR file.
.sp
.LP
When \fBtip\fR attempts to connect to a remote system, it opens the associated device with an exclusive-open \fBioctl\fR(2) call. Thus, only one user at a time may access a device. This is to prevent multiple processes from sampling the terminal line. In addition, \fBtip\fR honors the locking protocol used by \fBuucp\fR(1C).
.sp
.LP
When \fBtip\fR starts up, it reads commands from the file \fB\&.tiprc\fR in your home directory.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Typed characters are normally transmitted directly to the remote machine, which does the echoing as well.
.sp
.LP
At any time that \fBtip\fR prompts for an argument (for example, during setup of a file transfer), the line typed may be edited with the standard erase and kill characters. A null line in response to a prompt, or an interrupt, aborts the dialogue and returns you to the remote machine.
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A tilde (\fB~\fR) appearing as the first character of a line is an escape signal which directs \fBtip\fR to perform some special action. \fBtip\fR recognizes the following escape sequences:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB~^D\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB~.\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Drop the connection and exit (you may still be logged in on the remote machine). \fBNote:\fR If you rlogin and then run \fBtip\fR on the remote host, you must type \fB~~.\fR (tilde tilde dot) to end the \fBtip\fR session. If you type \fB~.\fR (tilde dot), it terminates the rlogin.

.sp
.LP
Copying files requires some cooperation on the part of the remote host. When a \fB~>\fR or \fB~<\fR escape is used to send a file, \fBtip\fR prompts for a file name (to be transmitted or received) and a command to be sent to the remote system, in case the file is being transferred from the remote system. While \fBtip\fR is transferring a file, the number of lines transferred will be continuously displayed on the screen. A file transfer may be aborted with an interrupt.
.SS "Auto-call Units"
.sp
.LP
\fBtip\fR may be used to dial up remote systems using a number of auto-call unit's (\fBACU\fRs). When the remote system description contains the \fBdu\fR capability, \fBtip\fR uses the call-unit (\fBcu\fR), \fBACU\fR type (\fBat\fR), and phone numbers (\fBpn\fR) supplied. Normally, \fBtip\fR displays verbose messages as it dials.
.sp
.LP
Depending on the type of auto-dialer being used to establish a connection, the remote host may have garbage characters sent to it upon connection. The user should never assume that the first characters typed to the foreign host are the first ones presented to it. The recommended practice is to immediately type a \fBkill\fR character upon establishing a connection (most UNIX systems either support \fB@\fR or Control-U as the initial kill character).
.sp
.LP
\fBtip\fR currently supports the Ventel MD-212+ modem and DC Hayes-compatible modems.
.sp
.LP
When \fBtip\fR initializes a Hayes-compatible modem for dialing, it sets up the modem to auto-answer. Normally, after the conversation is complete, \fBtip\fR drops \fBDTR\fR, which causes the modem to "hang up."
.sp
.LP
Most modems can be configured so that when \fBDTR\fR drops, they re-initialize themselves to a preprogrammed state. This can be used to reset the modem and disable auto-answer, if desired.
.sp
.LP
Additionally, it is possible to start the phone number with a Hayes \fBS\fR command so that you can configure the modem before dialing. For example, to disable auto-answer, set up all the phone numbers in \fB/etc/remote\fR using something like \fBpn=S0=0DT5551212\fR. The  \fBS0=0\fR disables auto-answer.
.SS "Remote Host Description"
.sp
.LP
Descriptions of remote hosts are normally located in the system-wide file \fB/etc/remote\fR. However, a user may maintain personal description files (and phone numbers) by defining and exporting the \fBREMOTE\fR shell variable. The \fBremote\fR file must be readable by \fBtip\fR, but a secondary file describing phone numbers may be maintained readable only by the user. This secondary phone number file is \fB/etc/phones\fR, unless the shell variable \fBPHONES\fR is defined and exported. The phone number file contains lines of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIsystem-name phone-number\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Each phone number found for a system is tried until either a connection is established, or an end of file is reached.  Phone numbers are constructed from `\fB0123456789\(mi=*\fR', where the `\fB=\fR' and `\fB*\fR' are used to indicate a second dial tone should be waited for (\fBACU\fR dependent).
.SS "tip Internal Variables"
.sp
.LP
\fBtip\fR maintains a set of variables which are used in normal operation. Some of these variables are read-only to normal users (root is allowed to change anything of interest). Variables may be displayed and set through the \fB~s\fR escape.  The syntax for variables is patterned after \fBvi\fR(1) and \fBmail\fR(1). Supplying \fBall\fR as an argument to the \fB~s\fR escape displays all variables that the user can read.  Alternatively, the user may request display of a particular variable by attaching a \fB?\fR to the end. For example, `\fB~s escape?\fR' displays the current escape character.
.sp
.LP
Variables are numeric (num), string (str), character (char), or Boolean (bool) values. Boolean variables are set merely by  specifying their name. They may be reset by prepending a \fB!\fR to the name. Other variable types are set by appending an \fB=\fR and the value. The entire assignment must not have any blanks in it. A single set command may be used to interrogate as well as set a number of variables.
.sp
.LP
Variables may be initialized at run time by placing set commands (without the \fB~s\fR prefix) in a \fB\&.tiprc\fR file in one's home directory. The \fB-v\fR option makes \fBtip\fR display the sets as they are made. Comments preceded by a \fB#\fR sign can appear in the  \fB\&.tiprc\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Finally, the variable names must either be completely specified or an abbreviation may be given.  The following list details those variables known to \fBtip\fR.
