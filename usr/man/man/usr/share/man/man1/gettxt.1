.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBgettxt\fR retrieves a text string from a message file in the directory \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB \fR. The directory name \fIlocale\fR corresponds to the language in which the text strings are written; see \fBsetlocale\fR(3C).

Name of the file in the directory \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB \fR to retrieve \fImsgnum\fR from. The name of \fImsgfile\fR can be up to 14 characters in length, but may not contain either \e0 (null) or the \fBASCII\fR code for \fB/\fR (slash) or \fB:\fR (colon).

Sequence number of the string to retrieve from \fImsgfile\fR. The strings in \fImsgfile\fR are numbered sequentially from \fI1\fR to \fIn\fR, where \fIn\fR is the number of strings in the file.

Default string to be displayed if \fBgettxt\fR fails to retrieve \fImsgnum\fR from \fImsgfile\fR. Nongraphic characters must be represented as alphabetic escape sequences.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The text string to be retrieved is in the file \fImsgfile\fR, created by the \fBmkmsgs\fR(1) utility and installed under the directory \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB   \fR. You control which directory is searched by setting the environment variable \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR. If \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR is not set, the environment variable \fBLANG\fR will be used. If \fBLANG\fR is not set, the files containing the strings are under the directory \fB/usr/lib/locale/C/\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB \fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fBgettxt\fR fails to retrieve a message in the requested language, it will try to retrieve the same message from \fB/usr/lib/locale/C/\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB/ \fR\fImsgfile\fR. If this also fails, and if \fIdflt_msg\fR is present and non-null, then it will display the value of \fIdflt_msg\fR; if \fIdflt_msg\fR is not present or is null, then it will display the string \fBMessage not found!!\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRThe environment variables \fBLANG\fR and \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the environment variables \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR have not been set to other than their default values, the following example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% gettxt UX:10 "hello world\en"\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
will try to retrieve the 10th message from \fB/usr/lib/locale/C/UX/\fR\fImsgfile\fR. If the retrieval fails, the message "hello world," followed by a newline, will be displayed.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of \fBgettxt\fR: \fBLC_CTYPE\fR and \fB\fR\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fB\&.   \fR
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBLC_CTYPE\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Determines how \fBgettxt\fR handles characters. When \fBLC_CTYPE\fR is set to a valid value, \fBgettxt\fR can display and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale. \fBgettxt\fR can display and handle Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters where any individual character can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes wide. \fBgettxt\fR can also handle \fBEUC\fR characters of 1, 2, or more column widths. In the "C" locale, only characters from ISO 8859-1 are valid.
.RE

.sp

.na
\fB\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt  
Determines how diagnostic and informative messages are presented. This includes the language and style of the messages, and the correct form of affirmative and negative responses.  In the "C" locale, the messages are presented in the default form found in the program itself (in most cases, U.S. English).
