.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBegrep\fR (\fIexpression grep\fR) utility searches files for a pattern of characters and prints all lines that contain that pattern. \fBegrep\fR uses full regular expressions (expressions that have string values that use the full set of alphanumeric and special characters) to match the patterns. It uses a fast deterministic algorithm that sometimes needs exponential space.
.sp
.LP
If no files are specified, \fBegrep\fR assumes standard input. Normally, each line found is copied to the standard output. The file name is printed before each line found if there is more than one input file.
.SS "/usr/bin/egrep"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/egrep\fR utility accepts full regular expressions as described on the \fBregexp\fR(5) manual page, except for \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR, \fB\e(\fR and \fB\e)\fR, \fB\e{\fR and \fB\e}\fR, \fB\e<\fR and \fB\e>\fR, and \fB\en\fR, and with the addition of:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
A full regular expression followed by \fB+\fR that matches one or more occurrences of the full regular expression.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
A full regular expression followed by \fB?\fR that matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the full regular expression.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
3.
Full regular expressions separated by | or by a \fBNEWLINE\fR that match strings that are matched by any of the expressions.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
A full regular expression that can be enclosed in parentheses \fB()\fRfor grouping.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Be careful using the characters \fB$\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB[\fR, \fB^\fR, |, \fB(\fR, \fB)\fR, and \fB\e\fR in \fIfull regular expression\fR, because they are also meaningful to the shell. It is safest to enclose the entire \fIfull regular expression\fR in single quotes (\fBa\'\fR\fBa\'\fR).
.sp
.LP
The order of precedence of operators is \fB[\|]\fR, then \fB*\|?\|+\fR, then concatenation, then | and NEWLINE.
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep\fR utility uses the regular expressions described in the \fBEXTENDED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\fR section of the \fBregex\fR(5) manual page.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Ideally there should be only one \fBgrep\fR command, but there is not a single algorithm that spans a wide enough range of space-time trade-offs.
.sp
.LP
Lines are limited only by the size of the available virtual memory.
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/egrep\fR utility is identical to \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR \fB-E\fR. See \fBgrep\fR(1). Portable applications should use \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/grep\fR \fB-E\fR.
