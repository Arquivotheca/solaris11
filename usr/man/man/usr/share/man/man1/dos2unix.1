.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdos2unix\fR utility converts characters in the \fBDOS\fR extended character set to the corresponding \fBISO\fR standard characters.
.sp

This command can be invoked from either \fBDOS\fR or SunOS. However, the filenames must conform to the conventions of the environment in which the command is invoked.
.sp

.na
\fB\fBFile \fIfilename\fR not found, or no read permission\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The input file you specified does not exist, or you do not have read permission. Check with the SunOS command, \fBls\fR \fB-l\fR (see \fBls\fR(1)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBBad output filename \fIfilename\fR, or no write permission\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

.na
\fB\fBError while writing to temporary file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An error occurred while converting your file, possibly because  there is not enough space on the current drive. Check the amount of space on the current drive using the \fBDIR\fR command. Also be certain that the default drive is write-enabled (not write-protected). Notice that when this error occurs, the original file remains intact.
