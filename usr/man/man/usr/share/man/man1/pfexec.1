.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpfexec\fR program is used to execute commands with the attributes specified by the user's profiles in the \fBexec_attr\fR(4) database. It is invoked by the profile shells, \fBpfsh\fR, \fBpfcsh\fR, and \fBpfksh\fR which are linked to the Bourne shell, C shell, and Korn shell, respectively.
.sp
.LP
Profiles are searched in the order specified in the user's entry in the \fBuser_attr\fR(4) database. If the same command appears in more than one profile, the profile shell uses the first matching entry.
.sp
.LP
The second form, \fBpfexec\fR \fB-P\fR \fIprivspec\fR, allows a user to obtain the additional privileges awarded to the user's profiles in \fBprof_attr\fR(4). The privileges specification on the commands line is parsed using \fBpriv_str_to_set\fR(3C). The resulting privileges are intersected with the union of the privileges specified using the \fBprivs\fR keyword in \fBprof_attr\fR(4) for all the user's profiles and added to the inheritable set before executing the command.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
\fBpfexec\fR is used to execute commands with predefined process attributes,  such as specific user or group \fBID\fRs.

Refer to the \fBsh\fR(1), \fBcsh\fR(1), and \fBksh\fR(1) man pages for complete usage descriptions of the profile shells.
