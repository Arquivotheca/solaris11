.SH NAME
write \- write to another user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBwrite\fR \fIuser\fR [\fIterminal\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwrite\fR utility reads lines from the user's standard input and writes them to the terminal of another user. When first invoked, it writes the message:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Message from \fIsender-login-id\fR (\fIsending-terminal\fR) [date]...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
to \fIuser\fR. When it has successfully completed the connection, the sender's terminal will be alerted twice to indicate that what the sender is typing is being written to the recipient's terminal.
.sp
.LP
If the recipient wants to reply, this can be accomplished by typing
.sp
.in +2
.nf
write \fIsender-login-id\fR [\fIsending-terminal\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
upon receipt of the initial message. Whenever a line of input as delimited by a \fBNL\fR, \fBEOF\fR, or \fBEOL\fR special character is accumulated while in canonical input mode, the accumulated data will be written on the other user's terminal. Characters are processed as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the alert character will write the alert character to the recipient's terminal.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the erase and kill characters will affect the sender's terminal in the manner described by the \fBtermios\fR(3C) interface.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters will cause \fBwrite\fR to write an appropriate message (EOT\en in the C locale) to the recipient's terminal and exit.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing characters from \fBLC_CTYPE\fR classifications \fBprint\fR or \fBspace\fR will cause those characters to be sent to the recipient's terminal.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When and only when the \fBstty\fR \fBiexten\fR local mode is enabled, additional special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte characters are processed as printable characters if their wide character equivalents are printable.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Typing other non-printable characters will cause them to be written to the recipient's terminal as follows: control characters will appear as a `\fB^\fR' followed by the appropriate \fBASCII\fR character, and characters with the high-order bit set will appear in "meta" notation. For example, `\fB\e003\fR\&' is displayed as `\fB^C\fR' and `\fB\e372\fR\&' as `\fBM\(miz\fR'.
.RE
.sp
.LP
To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the \fIterminal\fR argument can be used to indicate which terminal to write to. Otherwise, the recipient's terminal is the first writable instance of the user found in \fB/usr/adm/utmpx\fR, and the following informational message will be written to the sender's standard output, indicating which terminal was chosen:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIuser\fR is logged on more than one place.
You are connected to \fIterminal\fR.
Other locations are:\fIterminal\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Permission to be a recipient of a \fBwrite\fR message can be denied or granted by use of the \fBmesg\fR utility. However, a user's privilege may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users' terminals. The \fBwrite\fR utility will fail when the user lacks the appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.
.sp
.LP
If the character \fB!\fR is found at the beginning of a line, \fBwrite\fR calls the shell to execute the rest of the line as a command.
.sp
.LP
\fBwrite\fR runs \fBsetgid()\fR (see \fBsetuid\fR(2)) to the group \fBID\fR \fBtty\fR, in order to have write permissions on other users' terminals.
.sp
.LP
The following protocol is suggested for using \fBwrite\fR: when you first \fBwrite\fR to another user, wait for them to \fBwrite\fR back before starting to send. Each person should end a message with a distinctive signal (that is, \fB(o)\fR for \fIover\fR) so that the other person knows when to reply. The signal \fB(oo)\fR (for \fBover and out\fR) is suggested when conversation is to be terminated.
