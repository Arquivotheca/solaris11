.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBallocate\fR utility manages the ownership of devices through its allocation mechanism. It ensures that each device is used by only one qualified user at a time.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdevice\fR argument specifies the device to be manipulated. To preserve the integrity of the device's owner, the allocate operation is executed on all the device special files associated with that device.
.sp
.LP
The default allocate operation allocates the device special files associated with \fIdevice\fR to the \fBuid\fR of the current process.
.sp
.LP
Only authorized users may allocate a device. The required authorizations are specified in \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4).
.sp
.LP
When the system is configured with Trusted Extensions, \fBallocate\fR runs the clean program for the device before it grants access to the caller to that device. For devices with removable media that have a mountable file system, \fBallocate\fR mounts the media if the caller chooses.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-F\fR \fIdevice\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Force allocates either free or pre-allocated devices. This option is often used with the \fB-U\fR option to allocate/reallocate devices to a specific user. Only those users that have \fBsolaris.device.revoke\fR authorization are allowed to use this option. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIdev\(mitype\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Allocates devices with a device\(mitype matching \fIdev\(mitype\fR. The \fIdev\(mitype\fR argument specifies the device type to be operated on.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Silent. Suppresses any diagnostic output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR \fIuname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Uses the user ID \fIuname\fR instead of the user ID of the current process when performing the allocate operation. Only a user with the \fBsolaris.device.revoke\fR authorization is permitted to use this option.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following options are supported with Trusted Extensions:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Runs the device cleaning program in a windowing environment. If a windowing version of the program exists, it is used. Otherwise, the standard version is run in a terminal window.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzonename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Allocates device to the zone specified by \fIzonename\fR.
