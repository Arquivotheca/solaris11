.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdeallocate\fR command frees an allocated device. It resets the ownership and permissions on all device special files associated with the device, disabling access to that device. \fBdeallocate\fR runs the device cleaning program for that device as specified in \fBdevice_allocate\fR(4). 
.sp
.LP
The default \fBdeallocate\fR operation deallocates devices allocated to the user.
