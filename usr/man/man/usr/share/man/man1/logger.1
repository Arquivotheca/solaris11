.SH NAME
logger \- add entries to the system log
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlogger\fR [\fB-i\fR] [\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR] [\fB-p\fR \fIpriority\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fItag\fR] [\fImessage\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlogger\fR command provides a method for adding one-line entries to the system log file from the command line. One or more \fImessage\fR arguments can be given on the command line, in which case each is logged immediately. If this is unspecified, either the file indicated with \fB-f\fR or the standard input is added to the log.  Otherwise, a \fIfile\fR can be specified, in which case each line in the file is logged. If neither is specified, \fBlogger\fR reads and logs messages on a line-by-line basis from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Uses the contents of \fIfile\fR as the message to log.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Logs the process \fBID\fR of the \fBlogger\fR process with each line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fIpriority\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
Enters the message with the specified \fIpriority\fR. The message priority can be specified numerically, or as a \fIfacility\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIlevel\fR pair.  For example, `\fB\fR\fB-p\fR\fB local3.info\fR' assigns the message priority to the \fBinfo\fR level in the \fBlocal3\fR facility.  The default priority is \fBuser.notice\fR.

\fBExample 1 \fRExamples of the logger command
.sp
.LP
The following example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBlogger System rebooted\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
logs the message `\fBSystem rebooted\fR' to the default priority level \fBnotice\fR to be treated by \fBsyslogd\fR as are other messages to the facility  \fBuser\fR.

.sp
.LP
The next example:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBlogger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
reads from the file \fB/dev/idmc\fR and logs each line in that file as a message with the tag `\fBHOSTIDM\fR' at priority level \fBnotice\fR to be treated by \fBsyslogd\fR as are other messages to the facility \fBlocal0\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
