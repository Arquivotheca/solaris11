.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBdiff\fR utility compares the contents of \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR and write to standard output a list of changes necessary to convert \fIfile1\fR into \fIfile2\fR. This list should be minimal. Except in rare circumstances, \fBdiff\fR finds a smallest sufficient set of file differences. No output is produced if the files are identical.
.sp
.LP
The normal output contains lines of these forms:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIn1\fR \fBa\fR \fIn3,n4\fR
\fIn1,n2\fR \fBd\fR \fIn3\fR
\fIn1,n2\fR \fBc\fR \fIn3,n4\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIn1\fR and \fIn2\fR represent lines \fIfile1\fR and \fIn3\fR and \fIn4\fR represent lines in \fIfile2\fR These lines resemble \fBed\fR(1) commands to convert \fIfile1\fR to \fIfile2\fR. By exchanging \fBa\fR for \fBd\fR and reading backward, \fIfile2\fR can be converted to \fIfile1\fR. As in \fBed\fR, identical pairs, where \fIn1\fR=\fIn2\fR or \fIn3\fR=\fIn4\fR, are abbreviated as a single number.
.sp
.LP
Following each of these lines come all the lines that are affected in the first file flagged by `\|\fB<\fR\|', then all the lines that are affected in the second file flagged by `\|\fB>\fR\|'.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Ignores trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) and treats other strings of blanks as equivalent.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Ignores the case of letters. For example, `\fBA\fR' compares equal to `\fBa\fR'.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Expands TAB characters in output lines. Normal or \fB-c\fR output adds character(s) to the front of each line that can adversely affect the indentation of the original source lines and make the output lines difficult to interpret. This option preserves the original source's indentation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Ignores all blanks (SPACE and TAB characters) and treats all other strings of blanks as equivalent. For example, `\fBif ( a =\|= b )\fR' compares equal to `\fBif(a=\|=b)\fR'.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following options are mutually exclusive:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a listing of differences with three lines of context. With this option, output format is modified slightly. That is, output begins with identification of the files involved and their creation dates, then each change is separated by a line with a dozen \fB*\fR's. The lines removed from \fIfile1\fR are marked with '\(em'. The lines added to \fIfile2\fR are marked '\|+\|'. Lines that are changed from one file to the other are marked in both files with '\|!\|'.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a listing of differences identical to that produced by \fB-c\fR with \fInumber\fR lines of context.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIstring\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Creates a merged version of \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR with C preprocessor controls included so that a compilation of the result without defining \fIstring\fR is equivalent to compiling \fIfile1\fR, while defining \fIstring\fR yields \fIfile2\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a script of only \fBa\fR, \fBc\fR, and \fBd\fR commands for the editor \fBed\fR, which recreates \fIfile2\fR from \fIfile1\fR. In connection with the \fB-e\fR option, the following shell program can help maintain multiple versions of a file. Only an ancestral file ($1) and a chain of version-to-version \fBed\fR scripts ($2,$3,...) made by \fBdiff\fR need be on hand. A ``latest version'' appears on the standard output.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a similar script, not useful with \fBed\fR, in the opposite order.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Does a fast, uninspired job. 
.sp
This option only works when changed stretches are short and well-separated. It does work on files of unlimited length. 
.sp
Only -\fB-b\fR is available with \fB-h\fR. 
.sp
\fBdiff\fR does not descend into directories with this option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a script similar to \fB-e\fR, but in the opposite order and with a count of changed lines on each insert or delete command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Produces a listing of differences with three lines of context. The output is similar to that of the \fB-c\fR option, except that the context is "unified". Removed and changed lines in \fIfile1\fR are marked by a '\fB-\fR' while lines added or changed in \fIfile2\fR are marked by a '\fB+\fR'. Both versions of changed lines appear in the output, while added, removed, and context lines appear only once. The identification of \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR is different, with "\fB\(mi\(mi\(mi\fR" and "\fB+++\fR" being printed where "\fB***\fR" and "\fB\(mi\(mi\(mi\fR" would appear with the \fB-c\fR option. Each change is separated by a line of the form

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Editing scripts produced under the \fB-e\fR or \fB-f\fR options are naive about creating lines consisting of a single period (\fB\&.\fR).
.sp
.LP
Missing NEWLINE at end of file indicates that the last line of the file in question did not have a NEWLINE. If the lines are different, they are flagged and output, although the output seems to indicate they are the same.
