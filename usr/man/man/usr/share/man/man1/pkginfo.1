.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkginfo\fR displays information about software packages that are installed on the system (with the first synopsis)  or that reside on a particular device or directory (with the second synopsis).
.sp
.LP
Without options, \fBpkginfo\fR lists the primary category, package instance, and the names of all completely installed and partially installed packages. It displays one line for each package selected.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The \fB-p\fR and \fB-i\fR options are meaningless if used in conjunction with the \fB-d\fR option.
.sp
.LP
The options \fB-q\fR, \fB-x\fR, and \fB-l\fR are mutually exclusive.

.RS 4n
Display packages that match  \fIcategory\fR. Categories are defined with the \fBCATEGORY\fR parameter in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. If more than one category is supplied, the  package needs to match only one category in the list. The match is not case specific.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
A package designation by its instance. An instance can be the package abbreviation or a specific instance (for example, \fBinst.1\fR or \fBinst.2\fR). All instances of a package can be requested by \fBinst.*\fR. The asterisk character (\fB*\fR) is a special character to some shells and may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, "\fB*\fR" must be surrounded by single quotes (\fB\&'\fR) or preceded by a backslash (\e).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other package commands can process a datastream of  up to 4 GB.
