.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBspell\fR command collects words from the named \fBfile\fRs and looks them up in a spelling list. Words that neither occur among nor are derivable (by applying certain inflections, prefixes, or suffixes) from words in the spelling list are written to the standard output.
.sp
.LP
If there are no \fBfile\fR arguments, words to check are collected from the standard input. \fBspell\fR ignores most \fBtroff\fR(1), \fBtbl\fR(1), and \fBeqn\fR(1) constructs. Copies of all output words are accumulated in the history file (\fBspellhist\fR), and a \fBstop\fR list filters out misspellings (for example, \fBtheir=thy\(miy+ier\fR) that would otherwise pass.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBspell\fR (like \fBderoff\fR(1)) follows chains of included files (\fB\&.so\fR and \fB\&.nx\fR \fBtroff\fR(1) requests), unless the names of such included files begin with \fB/usr/lib\fR.
.sp
.LP
The standard spelling list is based on many sources, and while more haphazard than an ordinary dictionary, is also more effective in respect to proper names and popular technical words. Coverage of the specialized vocabularies of biology, medicine and chemistry is light.
.sp
.LP
Three programs help maintain and check the hash lists used by \fBspell\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhashmake\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Reads a list of words from the standard input and writes the corresponding nine-digit hash code on the standard output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBspellin\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Reads \fIn\fR hash codes from the standard input and writes a compressed spelling list on the standard output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhashcheck\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Reads a compressed \fIspelling_list\fR and recreates the nine-digit hash codes for all the words in it. It writes these codes on the standard output.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Check British spelling. Besides preferring \fBcentre\fR, \fBcolour\fR, \fBprogramme\fR, \fBspeciality\fR, \fBtravelled\fR, and so forth, this option insists upon \fI\(miise\fR in words like \fBstandardise\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Cause \fBderoff\fR(1) to ignore \fB\&.so\fR and \fB\&.nx\fR commands. If \fBderoff\fR(1) is not present on the system, then this option is ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Follow the chains of \fIall\fR included files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Print all words not literally in the spelling list, as well as plausible derivations from the words in the spelling list.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Print every plausible stem, one per line, with \fB=\fR preceding each word.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fIlocal_file\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Specify a set of words that are correct spellings (in addition to \fBspell\fR's own spelling list) for each job. \fIlocal_file\fR is the name of a user-provided file that contains a sorted list of words, one per line. Words found in \fIlocal_file\fR are removed from \fBspell\fR's output. Use \fBsort\fR(1) to order \fIlocal_file\fR in ASCII collating sequence. If this ordering is not followed, some entries in \fIlocal_file\fR might be ignored.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
.rt  
A path name of a text file to check for spelling errors. If no files are named, words are collected from the standard input.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP

The following exit values are returned:
.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBspell\fR works only on English words defined in the U.S. \fBASCII\fR codeset.
.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The spelling list's coverage is uneven. New installations might wish to monitor the output for several months to gather local additions.
.sp
.LP
British spelling was done by an American.
.sp
.LP
Misspelled words can be monitored by default. To do so, set the \fBH_SPELL\fR environment variable to the name of a file which is writable to the spell process. If \fBH_SPELL\fR is not set, \fB$HOME/.spellhist\fR is used as the history file. If no monitoring is desired, one can create the appropriate spell history file with write permission disabled.
