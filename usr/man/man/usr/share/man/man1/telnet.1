.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtelnet\fR utility communicates with another host using the \fBTELNET\fR protocol. If \fBtelnet\fR is invoked without arguments, it enters command mode, indicated by its prompt, \fBtelnet>\fR. In this mode, it accepts and executes its associated commands. See \fBUSAGE\fR. If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an \fBopen\fR command with those arguments.
.sp
.LP
If, for example, a \fIhost\fR is specified as \fI@hop1@hop2@host\fR, the connection goes through hosts \fIhop1\fR and \fIhop2\fR, using loose source routing to end at \fIhost\fR. If a leading \fB!\fR is used, the connection follows strict source routing. Notice that when \fBtelnet\fR uses IPv6, it can only use loose source routing, and the connection ignores the \fB!\fR.
.sp
.LP
Once a connection has been opened, \fBtelnet\fR enters input mode. In this mode, text typed is sent to the remote host. The input mode entered will be either "line mode", "character at a time", or "old line by line", depending upon what the remote system supports.
.sp
.LP
In "line mode", character processing is done on the local system, under the control of the remote system. When input editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay that information. The remote system will also relay changes to any special characters that happen on the remote system, so that they can take effect on the local system.
.sp
.LP
In "character at a time" mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.
.sp
.LP
In "old line by line" mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host. The "local echo character" (initially \fB^E\fR) may be used to turn off and on the local echo. (Use this mostly to enter passwords without the password being echoed.).
.sp
.LP
If the "line mode" option is enabled, or if the \fBlocalchars\fR toggle is \fBTRUE\fR (the default in "old line by line" mode), the user's \fBquit\fR, \fBintr\fR, and \fBflush\fR characters are trapped locally, and sent as \fBTELNET\fR protocol sequences to the remote side. If "line mode" has ever been enabled, then the user's \fBsusp\fR and \fBeof\fR are also sent as \fBTELNET\fR protocol sequences. \fBquit\fR is then sent as a \fBTELNET ABORT\fR instead of \fBBREAK\fR. The options \fBtoggle\fR \fBautoflush\fR and \fBtoggle\fR \fBautosynch\fR cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal (until the remote host acknowledges the \fBTELNET\fR sequence); and to flush previous terminal input, in the case of \fBquit\fR and \fBintr\fR.
.sp
.LP
While connected to a remote host, the user can enter \fBtelnet\fR command mode by typing the \fBtelnet\fR escape character (initially \fB^]\fR). When in command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available. Pressing RETURN at the \fBtelnet\fR command prompt causes \fBtelnet\fR to exit command mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-8\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an 8-bit data path. Negotiating the \fBTELNET BINARY\fR option is attempted for both input and output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Attempts automatic login. This sends the user name by means of the \fBUSER\fR variable of the \fBENVIRON\fR option, if supported by the remote system. The name used is that of the current user as returned by \fBgetlogin\fR(3C) if it agrees with the current user \fBID\fR. Otherwise, it is the name associated with the user \fBID\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disables the reading of the user's \fBtelnetrc\fR file. (See the \fBtoggle\fR \fBskiprc\fR command on this reference page.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the initial value of the \fBdebug\fR toggle to \fBTRUE\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIescape_char\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the initial escape character to \fIescape_char\fR. \fIescape_char\fR may also be a two character sequence consisting of \fB^\fR (Control key) followed by one character. If the second character is \fB?\fR, the \fBDEL\fR character is selected. Otherwise, the second character is converted to a control character and used as the escape character. If \fIescape_char\fR is defined as the null string (that is, \fB-e\fR \fB\&''\fR), this is equivalent to \fB-e\fR '\fB^@\fR' (Control-@). To specify that no character can be the escape character, use the \fB-E\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

\fB\fB-k\fR \fIrealm\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
If Kerberos authentication is being used, requests that \fBtelnet\fR obtain tickets for the remote host in \fIrealm\fR instead of the remote host's default realm as determined in\fBkrb5.conf\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-K\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fIuser\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When connecting to a remote system that understands the \fBENVIRON\fR option, then \fIuser\fR will be sent to the remote system as the value for the \fBENVIRON\fR variable \fBUSER\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an 8-bit data path on output. This causes the \fBBINARY\fR option to be negotiated on output.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fItracefile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Opens \fItracefile\fR for recording trace information. See the \fBset\fR \fItracefile\fR command below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a user interface similar to \fBrlogin\fR. In this mode, the escape character is set to the tilde (\fB~\fR) character, unless modified by the \fB-e\fR option. The \fBrlogin\fR escape character is only recognized when it is preceded by a carriage return. In this mode, the \fBtelnet\fR escape character, normally '\fB^]\fR', must still precede a \fBtelnet\fR command. The \fBrlogin\fR escape character can also be followed by '\fB\&.\er\fR' or '\fB^Z\fR', and, like \fBrlogin\fR(1), closes or suspends the connection, respectively. This option is an uncommitted interface and may change in the future.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Turns on encryption of the data stream. When this option is turned on, \fBtelnet\fR will exit with an error if authentication cannot be negotiated or if encryption cannot be turned on.

.SH USAGE
.SS "telnet Commands"
.sp
.LP
The commands described in this section are available with \fBtelnet\fR. It is necessary to type only enough of each command to uniquely identify it. (This is also true for arguments to the \fBmode\fR, \fBset\fR, \fBtoggle\fR, \fBunset\fR, \fBenviron\fR, and \fBdisplay\fR commands.)

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Open a connection to the named host. If no port number is specified, \fBtelnet\fR will attempt to contact a \fBTELNET\fR server at the default port. The host specification may be either a host name (see \fBhosts\fR(4)) or an Internet address specified in the "dot notation" (see \fBinet\fR(7P) or \fBinet6\fR(7P)). If the \fIhost\fR is specified as \fI@hop1@hop2@host\fR, the connection goes through hosts \fIhop1\fR and \fIhop2\fR, using loose source routing to end at \fIhost\fR. The \fB@\fR symbol is required as a separator between the hosts specified. If a leading \fB!\fR is used with IPv4, the connection follows strict source routing. 
.sp
The \fB-l\fR option passes the \fIuser\fR as the value of the \fBENVIRON\fR variable \fBUSER\fR to the remote system.
