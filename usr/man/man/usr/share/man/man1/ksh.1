.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBksh\fR is a command and programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file. \fBrksh\fR is a restricted version of the command interpreter \fBksh\fR. \fBrksh\fR is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the standard shell.
.sp
.LP
See \fBInvocation\fR for the meaning of arguments to the shell.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A \fImetacharacter\fR is defined as one of the following characters:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
; & ( ) | < > NEWLINE SPACE TAB
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A \fIblank\fR is a \fBTAB\fR or a \fBSPACE\fR. 
.sp
.LP
An \fIidentifier\fR is a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores starting with a letter or underscore. Identifiers are used as components of \fIvariable names\fR. 
.sp
.LP
A \fIvname\fR is a sequence of one or more identifiers separated by a period (\fB\&.\fR) and optionally preceded by a period (\fB\&.\fR). \fIvnames\fR are used as function and variable names. 
.sp
.LP
A \fIword\fR is a sequence of \fIcharacters\fR from the character set defined by the current locale, excluding non-quoted \fImetacharacters\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is a sequence of characters in the syntax of the shell language. The shell reads each command and carries out the desired action either directly or by invoking separate utilities. A built-in command is a command that is carried out by the shell itself without creating a separate process. Some commands are built-in purely for convenience and are not documented in this manual page. Built-ins that cause side effects in the shell environment and built-ins that are found before performing a path search (see \fBExecution\fR) are documented in this manual page. For historical reasons, some of these built-ins behave differently than other built-ins and are called special built-ins.
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A \fIsimple-command\fR is a list of variable assignments (see \fBVariable Assignments\fR) or a sequence of \fIblank\fR-separated words which can be preceded by a list of variable assignments. See the \fBEnvironment\fR section of this manual page.
.sp
.LP
The first word specifies the name of the command to be executed. Except as specified in this section, the remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0. See \fBexec\fR(2). The \fIvalue\fR of a simple-command is its exit status. If it terminates normally, its value is \fB0\fR-\fB255\fR. If it terminates abnormally, its value is \fB256+\fR\fIsignum\fR. The name of the signal corresponding to the exit status can be obtained by way of the \fB-l\fR option of the kill built-in utility. 
.sp
.LP
A \fIpipeline\fR is a sequence of one or more commands separated by \fB|\fR. The standard output of each command but the last is connected by a \fBpipe\fR(2) to the standard input of the next command. Each command, except possibly the last, is run as a separate process. The shell waits for the last command to terminate. The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command unless the \fBpipefail\fR option is enabled. Each pipeline can be preceded by the reserved word\fB!\fR. This causes the exit status of the pipeline to become \fB0\fR if the exit status of the last command is \fBnon-zero\fR, and \fB1\fR if the exit status of the last command is \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIlist\fR is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by \fB;, &, |&, &&, or |\fR, and optionally terminated by \fB;, &,\fR or \fB|&\fR. Of these five symbols, \fB;, &\fR, and \fB|&\fR have equal precedence, which is lower than that of \fB&&\fR and \fB||\fR. The symbols \fB&&\fR and \fB||\fR also have equal precedence. 
.sp
.LP
A semicolon (\fB;\fR) causes sequential execution of the preceding pipeline. An ampersand (\fB&\fR) causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline, that is, the shell does \fInot\fR wait for that pipeline to finish. The symbol \fB|&\fR causes asynchronous execution of the preceding pipeline with a two-way pipe established to the parent shell. The standard input and output of the spawned pipeline can be written to and read from by the parent shell by applying the redirection operators \fB<&\fR and \fB>&\fR with \fBarg p\fR to commands and by using \fB-p\fR option of the built-in commands \fBread\fR and \fBprint\fR. The symbol \fB&&\fR (\fB||\fR) causes the \fIlist\fR following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns a zero (\fBnon-zero\fR) value. One or more NEWLINEs can appear in a \fIlist\fR instead of a semicolon, to delimit a command. The first \fIitem\fR of the first \fIpipeline\fR of a \fIlist\fR that is a simple command not beginning with a redirection, and not occurring within a \fBwhile\fR, \fBuntil\fR, or \fBif\fR \fIlist\fR , can be preceded by a semicolon. This semicolon is ignored unless the \fBshowme\fR option is enabled as described with the \fBset\fR built-in.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is either a simple-command or one of commands in the following list. Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last simple-command executed in the command.

Each time a \fBfor\fR command is executed, \fIvname\fR is set to the next \fIword\fR taken from the \fBin\fR \fIword\fR list. If \fBin\fR \fIword ...\fR is omitted, the \fBfor\fR command executes the \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR once for each positional parameter that is set starting from 1. Execution ends when there are no more words in the list. See \fBParameter Expansion\fR.

The arithmetic expression \fIexpr1\fR is evaluated first. The arithmetic expression \fIexpr2\fR is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to \fBzero\fR and when \fBnon-zero\fR, \fIlist\fR is executed and the arithmetic expression \fIexpr3\fR evaluated. If any expression is omitted, then it behaves as if it evaluated to \fB1\fR. See \fBArithmetic Evaluation\fR.

.RS 4n
A \fBselect\fR command prints on standard error (file descriptor 2) the set of \fIwords\fR, each preceded by a number. If \fBin\fR \fIword...\fR is omitted, the positional parameters starting from \fB1\fR are used instead. See \fBParameter Expansion\fR. The \fBPS3\fR prompt is printed and a line is read from the standard input. If this line consists of the number of one of the listed \fIword\fRs, then the value of the variable \fIvname\fR is set to the \fIword\fR corresponding to this number. If this line is empty, the selection list is printed again. Otherwise the value of the variable \fIvname\fR is set to \fBnull\fR. The contents of the line read from standard input is saved in the variable \fBREPLY\fR. The \fIlist\fR is executed for each selection until a break or \fBEOF\fR is encountered. If the \fBREPLY\fR variable is set to \fBnull\fR by the execution of \fIlist\fR, the selection list is printed before displaying the \fBPS3\fR prompt for the next selection.

A \fBcase\fR command executes the \fIlist\fR associated with the first \fIpattern\fR that matches \fIword\fR. The form of the patterns is the same as that used for file name generation. See \fBFile Name Generation\fR.

The \fIlist\fR following \fBif\fR is executed and, if it returns a \fBzero\fR exit status, the \fIlist\fR following the first \fBthen\fR is executed. Otherwise, the \fIlist\fR following \fBelif\fR is executed, and, if its value is \fBzero\fR, the \fIlist\fR following the next \fBthen\fR is executed. Failing each successive \fBelif\fR \fIlist\fR, the \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR is executed. If the \fBif\fR \fIlist\fR has \fBnon-zero\fR exit status and there is no \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR, then the \fBif\fR command returns a \fBzero\fR exit status.

The body of the function is the \fIlist\fR of commands between \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR. A function defined with the function \fIvarname\fR syntax can also be used as an argument to the \fB\&.\fR special built-in command to get the equivalent behavior as if the \fIvarname\fR\fB()\fR syntax were used to define it.

.SS "Variable Assignments"

One or more variable assignments can start a simple command or can be arguments to the \fBtypeset\fR, \fBexport\fR, or \fBreadonly\fR special built-in commands. The syntax for an \fIassignment\fR is of the form:

In addition, a \fB+=\fR can be used in place of the \fB=\fR to signify adding to or appending to the previous value. When \fB+=\fR is applied to an arithmetic type, \fIword\fR is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the current value. When applied to a string variable, the value defined by \fIword\fR is appended to the value. For compound assignments, the previous value is not unset and the new values are appended to the current ones provided that the types are compatible. 
.RE

.SS "Comments"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with \fB#\fR causes that word and all the following characters up to a NEWLINE to be commented, or ignored.
.SS "Aliasing"
.sp
.LP
The first word of each command is replaced by the text of an alias if an alias for this word has been defined. An alias name consists of any number of characters excluding metacharacters, quoting characters, file expansion characters, parameter expansion characters, command substitution characters, and \fB=\fR. The replacement string can contain any valid shell script including the metacharacters listed in the \fBCommands\fR section. The first word of each command in the replaced text, other than any that are in the process of being replaced, are tested for aliases. If the last character of the alias value is a BLANK then the word following the alias is also checked for alias substitution. 
.sp
.LP
Aliases can be used to redefine built-in commands but cannot be used to redefine the reserved words listed in the \fBCommands\fR section. Aliases can be created and listed with the alias command and can be removed with the \fBunalias\fR command.
.sp
.LP
Aliasing is performed when scripts are read, not while they are executed. For an alias to take effect, the \fBalias\fR definition command has to be executed before the command which references the alias is read. The following aliases are compiled into the shell but can be unset or redefined:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
autoload='typeset -fu'
command='command '
fc=hist
float='typeset -lE'
functions='typeset -f'
hash='alias -t --'
history='hist -l'
integer='typeset -li'
nameref='typeset -n'
nohup='nohup '
r='hist -s'
redirect='command exec'
source='command .'
stop='kill -s STOP'
suspend='kill -s STOP $$'
times='{ { time;} 2>&1;}'
type='whence -v'
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Tilde Substitution"
.sp
.LP
After alias substitution is performed, each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted tilde (\fB~\fR). For tilde substitution, \fIword\fR also refers to the \fIword\fR portion of parameter expansion. See \fBParameter Expansion\fR. 
.sp
.LP
If it does, the word up to a \fB/\fR is checked to see if it matches a user name in the password database. If a match is found, the \fB~\fR and the matched login name are replaced by the login directory of the matched user. If no match is found, the original text is left unchanged. A \fB~\fR by itself, or in front of a \fB/\fR, is replaced by \fB$HOME\fR. A \fB~\fR followed by a \fB+\fR or \fB-\fR is replaced by the value of \fB$PWD\fR and \fB$OLDPWD\fR respectively.
.sp
.LP
In addition, when expanding a \fIvariable assignment\fR, tilde substitution is attempted when the value of the assignment begins with a \fB~\fR, and when a \fB~\fR appears after a colon (\fB:\fR). The \fB:\fR also terminates a \fB~\fR login name.
.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The standard output from a command enclosed in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign (\fB$\fR) or a pair of grave accents (\fB``\fR) can be used as part or all of a word. Trailing NEWLINEs are removed. In the second (obsolete) form, the string between the quotes is processed for special quoting characters before the command is executed. See \fBQuoting\fR. 
.sp
.LP
The command substitution \fB$(cat file)\fR can be replaced by the equivalent but faster \fB$(<file)\fR. The command substitution \fB$(\fR\fIn\fR\fB<#)\fR expands to the current byte offset for file descriptor \fIn\fR.
.SS "Arithmetic Substitution"
.sp
.LP
An arithmetic expression enclosed in double parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ( \fB$((\fR\fIarithmetic_expression\fR\fB))\fR) is replaced by the value of the arithmetic expression within the double parentheses.
.SS "Process Substitution"
.sp
.LP
Process substitution is only available on versions of the UNIX operating system that support the \fB/dev/fd\fR directory for naming open files. 
.sp
.LP
Each command argument of the form \fB<(\fR\fIlist\fR\fB)\fR or \fB>(\fR\fIlist\fR\fB)\fR runs process \fIlist\fR asynchronously connected to some file in \fB/dev/fd\fR. The name of this file becomes the argument to the command. If the form with \fB>\fR is selected then writing on this file provides input for \fIlist\fR. If \fB<\fR is used, then the file passed as an argument contains the output of the \fIlist\fR process. 
.sp
.LP
For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
paste <(cut -f1 \fIfile1\fR) <(cut -f3 \fIfile2\fR) | tee \e
     >(\fIprocess1\fR) >(\fIprocess2\fR)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\fBcut\fRs fields 1 and 3 from the files \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR respectively, \fBpaste\fRs the results together, and sends it to the processes \fIprocess1\fR and \fIprocess2\fR. It also displays the results to the standard output. The file, which is passed as an argument to the command, is a UNIX \fBpipe\fR(2). Programs that expect to \fBlseek\fR(2) on the file do not work. 
.SS "Parameter Expansion"
.sp
.LP
A parameter is a variable, one or more digits, or any of the characters \fB*\fR, \fB@\fR, \fB#\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB-\fR, \fB$\fR, and \fB!\fR. A variable is denoted by a \fIvname\fR. To create a variable whose \fIvname\fR contains a \fB\&.\fR, a variable whose \fBvname\fR consists of everything before the last . must already exist. A variable has a value and zero or more attributes. Variables can be assigned values and attributes by using the \fBtypeset\fR special built-in command. The attributes supported by the shell are described later with the \fBtypeset\fR special built-in command. Exported variables pass values and attributes to the environment. 
.sp
.LP
The shell supports both indexed and associative arrays. An element of an array variable is referenced by a subscript. A subscript for an indexed array is denoted by an arithmetic expression, (see \fBArithmetic Evaluation\fR), between a \fB[\fR and a \fB]\fR. Use \fBset -A\fR \fIvname value ...\fR to assign values to an indexed array. The value of all subscripts must be in the range of \fB0\fR through \fB1,048,575\fR. Indexed arrays do not need to be declared. Any reference to a variable with a valid subscript is legal and an array is created if necessary. 
.sp
.LP
An associative array is created with the \fB-A\fR option to \fBtypeset\fR. A subscript for an associative array is denoted by a string enclosed between \fB[\fR and \fB]\fR. 
.sp
.LP
Referencing any array without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with subscript \fB0\fR.
.sp
.LP
The value of a variable can be assigned by:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIvname\fR=\fIvalue\fR [\fIvname\fR=\fIvalue\fR] ...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
or
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIvname\fR[\fIsubscript\fR]=\fIvalue\fR [\fIvname\fR[\fIsubscript\fR]=\fIvalue\fR] ...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
No space is allowed before or after the \fB=\fR. A \fInameref\fR is a variable that is a reference to another variable. A \fInameref\fR is created with the \fB-n\fR attribute of \fBtypeset\fR. The value of the variable at the time of the \fBtypeset\fR command becomes the variable that is referenced whenever the \fInameref\fR variable is used. The name of a \fInameref\fR cannot contain a dot (\fI\&.\fR). When a variable or function name contains a \fB\&.,\fR and the portion of the name up to the first \fB\&.\fR matches the name of a \fInameref\fR, the variable referred to is obtained by replacing the \fInameref\fR portion with the name of the variable referenced by the \fInameref\fR. If a \fInameref\fR is used as the index of a \fBfor\fR loop, a name reference is established for each item in the list. A \fInameref\fR provides a convenient way to refer to the variable inside a function whose name is passed as an argument to a function. For example, if the name of a variable is passed as the first argument to a function, the command
.sp
.in +2
.nf
 typeset -n var=$1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
inside the function causes references and assignments to \fIvar\fR to be references and assignments to the variable whose name has been passed to the function. If either of the floating point attributes, \fB-E\fR, or \fB-F\fR, or the integer attribute, \fB-i\fR, is set for \fIvname\fR, then the \fIvalue\fR is subject to arithmetic evaluation as described in this manual page. Positional parameters, parameters denoted by a number, can be assigned values with the \fBset\fR special built-in command. Parameter \fB$0\fR is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked. The character \fB$\fR is used to introduce substitutable parameters.

The shell reads all the characters from \fB${\fR to the matching \fB}\fR as part of the same word even if it contains braces or metacharacters. The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted. The braces are required when \fIparameter\fR is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted as part of its name, when the variable name contains a \fB\&.\fR, or when a variable is subscripted. If \fIparameter\fR is one or more digits then it is a positional parameter. A positional parameter of more than one digit must be enclosed in braces. If \fIparameter\fR is \fB*\fR or \fB@\fR, then all the positional parameters, starting with \fB$1\fR, are substituted and separated by a field separator character. If an array \fIvname\fR with subscript \fB*\fR or \fB@\fR is used, then the value for each of the elements is substituted, separated by the first character of the value of \fBIFS\fR.

The braces denote optional portions. The optional \fIp\fR is a digit specifying the \fIprecision\fR, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.

.SS "Field Splitting"

After parameter expansion and command substitution, the results of substitutions are scanned for the field separator characters (those found in \fBIFS\fR) and split into distinct fields where such characters are found. Explicit null fields (\fB""\fR or \fB\&''\fR) are retained. Implicit null fields, those resulting from parameters that have no values or command substitutions with no output, are removed.

In each case, fields are created by prepending the characters before the \fB{\fR and appending the characters after the } to each of the strings generated by the characters between the \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR.

In the first form, a field is created for each string between \fB{\fR and \fB,,\fR between \fB,\fR and \fB,,\fR and between , and \fB}\fR. The string represented by \fB*\fR can contain embedded matching { and } without quoting. Otherwise, each \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR with \fB*\fR must be quoted.
.sp

In the second form, \fIl1\fR and \fIl2\fR must both be either upper case or both be lower case characters in the C locale. In this case a field is created for each character from \fIl1\fR through \fIl2\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the remaining forms, a field is created for each number starting at \fIn1\fR. This continues until it reaches \fIn2\fR and increments \fIn1\fR by \fIn3\fR. The cases where \fIn3\fR is not specified behave as if \fIn3\fR were 1 if \fIn1\fR\fB<=\fR\fIn2\fR, and \fB-1\fR otherwise. In forms which specify \fB%\fR\fIfmt\fR, any format flags, widths and precisions can be specified and \fIfmt\fR can end in any of the specifiers \fBcdiouxX\fR. For example, \fB{a,z}{1..5..3%02d}{b..c}x\fR expands to the 8 fields, \fBa01bx, a01cx, a04bx, a04cx, z01bx, z01cx, z04bx,\fR and \fBz4cx\fR.

If \fBFIGNORE\fR is set, then each file name component that matches the pattern defined by the value of \fBFIGNORE\fR is ignored when generating the matching file names. The names \fB\&.\fR and \fB\&..\fR are also ignored. If \fBFIGNORE\fR is not set, the character \fB\&.\fR at the start of each file name component is ignored unless the first character of the pattern corresponding to this component is the character \fB\&.\fR itself.

The shell performs arithmetic evaluation for arithmetic substitution, to evaluate an arithmetic command, to evaluate an indexed array subscript, and to evaluate arguments to the built-in commands \fBshift\fR and \fBlet\fR. Arithmetic evaluation is also performed on argument operands of the built-in command printf that correspond to numeric format specifiers in the format operand. See \fBprintf\fR(1). Evaluations are performed using double precision floating point arithmetic or long double precision floating point for systems that provide this data type. Floating point constants follow the \fBANSI-C\fR programming language floating point conventions. Integer constants follow the \fBANSI-C\fR programming language integer constant conventions although only single byte character constants are recognized and character casts are not recognized. Constants can be of the form \fB[\fR\fIbase#\fR\fB]\fR\fIn\fR where \fIbase\fR is a decimal number between two and sixty-four representing the arithmetic base and \fIn\fR is a number in that base. The digits greater than \fB9\fR are represented by the lower case letters, the upper case letters, \fB@\fR, and \fB_\fR respectively. For bases less than or equal to \fB36\fR, upper and lower case characters can be used interchangeably.
.sp

An arithmetic expression uses the same syntax, precedence, and associativity of expression as the C language. All the C language operators that apply to floating point quantities can be used. In addition, the operator \fB**\fR can be used for exponentiation. It has higher precedence than multiplication and is left associative. When the value of an arithmetic variable or subexpression can be represented as a long integer, all C language integer arithmetic operations can be performed. Variables can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression without using the parameter expansion syntax. When a variable is referenced, its value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.

The \fB-E\fR option causes the expansion of the value to be represented using scientific notation when it is expanded. The optional option argument \fIn\fR defines the number of significant figures. The \fB-F\fR option causes the expansion to be represented as a floating decimal number when it is expanded.

If one of the redirection operators is preceded by a digit, with no intervening space, then the file descriptor number referred to is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1). If one of the redirection operators other than \fB>&-\fR and the \fB>#\fR and \fB<#\fR forms, is preceded by \fB{\fR\fIvarname\fR\fB}\fR with no intervening space, then a file descriptor number \fB> 10\fR is selected by the shell and stored in the variable \fIvarname\fR. If \fB>&-\fR or the any of the \fB>#\fR and \fB<#\fR forms is preceded by \fB{\fR\fIvarname\fR\fB}\fR the value of \fIvarname\fR defines the file descriptor to close or position. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&... 2>&1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
means file descriptor 2 is to be opened for writing as a duplicate of file descriptor 1 and
.sp
.in +2
.nf
exec [\fIn\fR]<\fIfile\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
means open \fIfile\fR for reading and store the file descriptor number in variable \fIn\fR. The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the (\fIfile_descriptor\fR, \fIfile\fR) association at the time of evaluation. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&... 1>\fIfname\fR 2>&1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file \fIfname\fR. It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1, that is, \fIfname\fR. If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file \fIfname\fR. If a command is followed by \fB&\fR and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file \fB/dev/null\fR. Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input and output specifications.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The \fIenvironment\fR is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument list. See \fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The names must be \fIidentifiers\fR and the values are character strings. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a variable for each name found, giving it the corresponding value and attributes and marking it \fBexport\fR. Executed commands inherit the environment. If the user modifies the values of these variables or creates new ones, using the \fBexport\fR or \fBtypeset\fR \fB-x\fR commands, they become part of the environment. The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, whose values can be modified by the current shell, plus any additions which must be noted in \fBexport\fR or \fBtypeset\fR \fB-x\fR commands. The environment for any simple-command or function can be augmented by prefixing it with one or more variable assignments. A variable assignment argument is a word of the form \fIidentifier\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
TERM=450 cmd args
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
(export TERM; TERM=450; cmd args)
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
are equivalent (as far as the execution of \fIcmd\fR is concerned except for special built-in commands listed in the \fBBuilt-Ins\fR section, those that are preceded with a dagger. If the obsolete \fB-k\fR option is set, all variable assignment arguments are placed in the environment, even if they occur after the command name. 
.sp
.LP
The following example first prints \fBa=b c\fR and then \fBc\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
echo a=b c
set -k
echo a=b c
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This feature is intended for use with scripts written for early versions of the shell and its use in new scripts is strongly discouraged.
.SS "Functions"
.sp
.LP
For historical reasons, there are two ways to define functions, the \fBname()\fR syntax and the \fBfunction\fR \fBname\fR syntax. These are described in the \fBCommands\fR section of this manual page. 
.sp
.LP
Shell functions are read in and stored internally. Alias names are resolved when the function is read. Functions are executed like commands with the arguments passed as positional parameters. See the \fBExecution\fR section of this manual page for details.
.sp
.LP
Functions defined by the \fBfunction\fR \fBname\fR syntax and called by name execute in the same process as the caller and share all files and present working directory with the caller. Traps caught by the caller are reset to their default action inside the function. A trap condition that is not caught or ignored by the function causes the function to terminate and the condition to be passed on to the caller. A trap on \fBEXIT\fR set inside a function is executed in the environment of the caller after the function completes. Ordinarily, variables are shared between the calling program and the function. However, the \fBtypeset\fR special built-in command used within a function defines local variables whose scope includes the current function. They can be passed to functions that they call in the variable assignment list that precedes the call or as arguments passed as name references. Errors within functions return control to the caller.
.sp
.LP
Functions defined with the \fBname()\fR syntax and functions defined with the \fBfunction\fR \fBname\fR syntax that are invoked with the \fB\&.\fR special built-in are executed in the caller's environment and share all variables and traps with the caller. Errors within these function executions cause the script that contains them to abort.
.sp
.LP
The special built-in command \fBreturn\fR is used to return from function calls.
.sp
.LP
Function names can be listed with the \fB-f\fR or \fB+f\fR option of the \fBtypeset\fR special built-in command. The text of functions, when available, is also listed with \fB-f\fR. Functions can be undefined with the \fB-f\fR option of the \fBunset\fR special built-in command.
.sp
.LP
Ordinarily, functions are unset when the shell executes a shell script. Functions that need to be defined across separate invocations of the shell should be placed in a directory and the \fBFPATH\fR variable should contain the name of this directory. They can also be specified in the \fBENV\fR file.
.SS "Discipline Functions"
.sp
.LP
Each variable can have zero or more discipline functions associated with it. The shell initially understands the discipline names \fBget\fR, \fBset\fR, \fBappend\fR, and \fBunset\fR but on most systems others can be added at run time via the C programming interface extension provided by the \fBbuiltin\fR built-in utility. If the \fBget\fR discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever the specified variable is referenced. If the variable \fB\&.sh.value\fR is assigned a value inside the discipline function, the referenced variable is evaluated to this value instead. If the \fBset\fR discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever the specified variable is assigned a value. If the \fBappend\fR discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever a value is appended to the specified variable. The variable \fB\&.sh.value\fR is specified the value of the variable before invoking the discipline, and the variable is assigned the value of \fB\&.sh.value\fR after the discipline completes. If .\fBsh.value\fR is \fBunset\fR inside the discipline, then that value is unchanged. If the \fBunset\fR discipline is defined for a variable, it is invoked whenever the specified variable is unset. The variable is not unset unless it is unset explicitly from within this discipline function.
.sp
.LP
The variable \fB\&.sh.name\fR contains the name of the variable for which the discipline function is called, \fB\&.sh.subscript\fR is the subscript of the variable, and \fB\&.sh.value\fR contains the value being assigned inside the \fBset\fR discipline function. For the \fBset\fR discipline, changing \fB\&.sh.value\fR changes the value that gets assigned. 
.SS "Jobs"
.sp
.LP
If the monitor option of the \fBset\fR command is turned on, an interactive shell associates a job with each pipeline. It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the \fBjobs\fR command, and assigns them small integer numbers. When a job is started asynchronously with \fB&\fR, the shell prints a line which looks like:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[1] 1234
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was \fB1234\fR.
.sp
.LP
If you are running a job and wish to stop it, CTRL-z sends a \fBSTOP\fR signal to the current job. The shell normally displays a message that the job has been stopped, and displays another prompt. You can then manipulate the state of this job, putting it in the background with the \fBbg\fR command, or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with the foreground command \fBfg\fR. A CTRL-z takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.
.sp
.LP
A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the command \fBsttytostop\fR. If you set this \fBtty\fR option, then background jobs stop when they try to produce output like they do when they try to read input. 
.sp
.LP
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell. A job can be referred to by the process id of any process of the job or by one of the following:
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state. It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only just before it prints a prompt. This is done so that it does not otherwise disturb your work. The notify option of the \fBset\fR command causes the shell to print these job change messages as soon as they occur.
.sp
.LP
When the \fBmonitor\fR option is on, each background job that completes triggers any trap set for \fBCHLD\fR.
.sp
.LP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or stopped, you are warned that \fBYou have stopped(running) jobs.\fR You can use the \fBjobs\fR command to see what they are. If you immediately try to exit again, the shell does not warn you a second time, and the stopped jobs are terminated. When a login shell receives a \fBHUP\fR signal, it sends a \fBHUP\fR signal to each job that has not been disowned with the \fBdisown\fR built-in command.
.SS "Signals"
.sp
.LP
The \fBINT\fR and \fBQUIT\fR signals for an invoked command are ignored if the command is followed by \fB&\fR and the \fBmonitor\fR option is not active. Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by the shell from its parent. See the \fBtrap\fR built-in command.
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is read, the substitutions are carried out. If the command name matches one of the ones in the \fBSpecial Built-in Commands\fR section of this manual page, it is executed within the current shell process. Next, the command name is checked to see if it matches a user defined function. If it does, the positional parameters are saved and then reset to the arguments of the function call. A function is also executed in the current shell process. When the function completes or issues a return, the positional parameter list is restored. For functions defined with the \fBfunction\fR \fBname\fR syntax, any trap set on \fBEXIT\fR within the function is executed. The exit value of a function is the value of the last command executed. If a command name is not a special built-in command or a user defined function, but it is one of the built-in commands, it is executed in the current shell process.
.sp
.LP
The shell variable \fBPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fB/bin:/usr/bin:\fR, specifying \fB/bin\fR, \fB/usr/bin\fR, and the current directory in that order. The current directory can be specified by two or more adjacent colons, or by a colon at the beginning or end of the path list. If the command name contains a slash (\fB/\fR), the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an executable file of the specified name that is not a directory. If found, and if the shell determines that there is a built-in version of a command corresponding to a specified pathname, this built-in is invoked in the current process. If found, and this directory is also contained in the value of the \fBFPATH\fR variable, then this file is loaded into the current shell environment as if it were the argument to the . command except that only preset aliases are expanded, and a function of the specified name is executed as described in this manual page. If not found, and the file \fB\&.paths\fR is found, and this file contains a line of the form \fBFPATH=\fR\fIpath\fR where \fIpath\fR is an existing directory, and this directory contains a file of the specified name, then this file is loaded into the current shell environment as if it were the argument to the \fB\&. special\fR built-in command and a function of the specified name is executed. Otherwise, if found, a process is created and an attempt is made to execute the command using \fBexec\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
When an executable is found, the directory where it is found in is searched for a file named \fB\&.paths\fR. If this file is found and it contains a line of the form \fBBUILTIN_LIB=\fR\fIvalue\fR, the library named by \fIvalue\fR is searched for as if it were an option argument to \fBbuiltin -f\fR, and if it contains a built-in of the specified name this is executed instead of a command by this name. Otherwise, if this file is found and it contains a line of the form \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR in the first or second line, then the environment variable \fIname\fR is modified by prepending the directory specified by \fIvalue\fR to the directory list. If \fIvalue\fR is not an absolute directory, then it specifies a directory relative to the directory that the executable was found. If the environment variable \fIname\fR does not already exist it is added to the environment list for the specified command.
.sp
.LP
If the file has execute permission but is not an \fBa.out\fR file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A separate shell is spawned to read it. All non-exported variables are removed in this case. If the shell command file doesn't have read permission, and/or if the \fBsetuid\fR and \fBsetgid\fR bits are set on the file, then the shell executes an agent whose job it is to set up the permissions and execute the shell with the shell command file passed down as an open file. A parenthesized command is executed in a sub-shell without removing non-exported variables.
.SS "Command Re-entry"
.sp
.LP
The text of the last \fBHISTSIZE\fR (default 512) commands entered from a terminal device is saved in a history file. The file \fB$HOME/.sh_history\fR is used if the \fBHISTFILE\fR variable is not set or if the file it names is not writable. A shell can access the commands of all interactive shells which use the same named \fBHISTFILE\fR. The built-in command \fBhist\fR is used to list or edit a portion of this file. The portion of the file to be edited or listed can be selected by number or by giving the first character or characters of the command. A single command or range of commands can be specified. If you do not specify an editor program as an argument to \fBhist\fR then the value of the variable \fBHISTEDIT\fR is used. If \fBHISTEDIT\fR is unset, the obsolete variable \fBFCEDIT\fR is used. If \fBFCEDIT\fR is not defined, then \fB/bin/ed\fR is used. The edited commands are printed and executed again upon leaving the editor unless you quit without writing. The \fB-s\fR option (and in obsolete versions, the editor name \fB-\fR) is used to skip the editing phase and to re-execute the command. In this case a substitution parameter of the form \fIold\fR\fB=\fR\fInew\fRcan be used to modify the command before execution. For example, with the preset alias \fBr\fR, which is aliased to \fB\&'hist -s'\fR, typing \fB`r bad=good c'\fR re-executes the most recent command which starts with the letter \fBc\fR, replacing the first occurrence of the string bad with the string good. 
.SS "Inline Editing Options"
.sp
.LP
Normally, each command line entered from a terminal device is simply typed followed by a NEWLINE (RETURN or LINE FEED). If either the \fBemacs\fR, \fBgmacs\fR, or \fBvi\fR option is active, the user can edit the command line. To be in either of these edit modes set the corresponding option. An editing option is automatically selected each time the \fBVISUAL\fR or \fBEDITOR\fR variable is assigned a value ending in either of these option names.
.sp
.LP
The editing features require that the user's terminal accept RETURN as carriage return without line feed and that a SPACE must overwrite the current character on the screen.
.sp
.LP
Unless the \fBmultiline\fR option is on, the editing modes implement a concept where the user is looking through a window at the current line. The window width is the value of \fBCOLUMNS\fR if it is defined, otherwise \fB80\fR. If the window width is too small to display the prompt and leave at least 8 columns to enter input, the prompt is truncated from the left. If the line is longer than the window width minus two, a mark is displayed at the end of the window to notify the user. As the cursor moves and reaches the window boundaries the window is centered about the cursor. The mark is a \fB>\fR (\fB<, *\fR) if the line extends on the right , left, or both sides of the window.
.sp
.LP
The search commands in each edit mode provide access to the history file. Only strings are matched, not patterns, although a leading \fB^\fR in the string restricts the match to begin at the first character in the line.
.sp
.LP
Each of the edit modes has an operation to list the files or commands that match a partially entered word. When applied to the first word on the line, or the first word after a \fB;\fR, \fB|\fR, \fB&\fR, or \fB(\fR, and the word does not begin with \fB~\fR or contain a \fB/\fR, the list of aliases, functions, and executable commands defined by the \fBPATH\fR variable that could match the partial word is displayed. Otherwise, the list of files that match the specified word is displayed. If the partially entered word does not contain any file expansion characters, a \fB*\fR is appended before generating these lists. After displaying the generated list, the input line is redrawn. These operations are called command name listing and file name listing, respectively. There are additional operations, referred to as command name completion and file name completion, which compute the list of matching commands or files, but instead of printing the list, replace the current word with a complete or partial match. For file name completion, if the match is unique, a \fB/\fR is appended if the file is a directory and a space is appended if the file is not a directory. Otherwise, the longest common prefix for all the matching files replaces the word. For command name completion, only the portion of the file names after the last \fB/\fR are used to find the longest command prefix. If only a single name matches this prefix, then the word is replaced with the command name followed by a space. When using a \fBTAB\fR for completion that does not yield a unique match, a subsequent TAB provides a numbered list of matching alternatives. A specific selection can be made by entering the selection number followed by a TAB.
.SS "Key Bindings"
.sp
.LP
The \fBKEYBD\fR trap can be used to intercept keys as they are typed and change the characters that are actually seen by the shell. This trap is executed after each character (or sequence of characters when the first character is ESC) is entered while reading from a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The variable \fB\&.sh.edchar\fR contains the character or character sequence which generated the trap. Changing the value of \fB\&.sh.edchar\fR in the trap action causes the shell to behave as if the new value were entered from the keyboard rather than the original value. The variable \fB\&.sh.edcol\fR is set to the input column number of the cursor at the time of the input. The variable \fB\&.sh.edmode\fR is set to \fBESC\fR when in \fBvi\fR insert mode and is null otherwise. By prepending \fB${.sh.editmode}\fR to a value assigned to \fB\&.sh.edchar\fR it causes the shell to change to control mode if it is not already in this mode.
.sp
.LP
This trap is not invoked for characters entered as arguments to editing directives, or while reading input for a character search.
.SS "\fBemacs\fR Editing Mode"
.sp
.LP
This mode is entered by enabling either the \fBemacs\fR or \fBgmacs\fR option. The only difference between these two modes is the way they handle \fB^T\fR. To edit, the user moves the cursor to the point needing correction and then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed. All the editing commands are control characters or escape sequences. The notation for control characters is caret (\fB^\fR) followed by the character.
.sp
.LP
For example, \fB^F\fR is the notation for CTRL/F. This is entered by depressing \fBf\fR while holding down the CTRL (control) key. The SHIFT key is not depressed. (The notation \fB^?\fR indicates the DEL (delete) key.)
.sp
.LP
The notation for escape sequences is \fBM-\fR followed by a character. For example, \fBM-f\fR (pronounced \fBMeta f\fR) is entered by depressing ESC (\fBASCII 033\fR) followed by \fBf\fR. \fBM-F\fR is the notation for ESC followed by \fBF\fR.
.sp
.LP
All edit commands operate from any place on the line, not just at the beginning. The RETURN or the LINE FEED key is not entered after edit commands except when noted.

.SS "\fBvi\fR Editing Mode"
.sp
.LP
There are two typing modes. Initially, when you enter a command you are in the input mode. To edit, the user enters control mode by typing ESC (033) and moves the cursor to the point needing correction and then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed. Most control commands accept an optional repeat \fIcount\fR prior to the command. 
.sp
.LP
When in vi mode on most systems, canonical processing is initially enabled and the command is echoed again if the speed is 1200 baud or greater and it contains any control characters or less than one second has elapsed since the prompt was printed. The ESC character terminates canonical processing for the remainder of the command and the user can then modify the command line. This scheme has the advantages of canonical processing with the type-ahead echoing of raw mode.
.sp
.LP
If the option \fBviraw\fR is also set, the terminal is always have canonical processing disabled. This mode is implicit for systems that do not support two alternate end of line delimiters, and might be helpful for certain terminals.

\fBalias\fR with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR on standard output. The \fB-p\fR option causes the word alias to be inserted before each one.

A trailing space in \fIvalue\fR causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution. The obsolete \fB-t\fR option is used to set and list tracked aliases. The value of a tracked alias is the full pathname corresponding to the specified \fIname\fR. The value becomes undefined when the value of \fBPATH\fR is reset but the alias remains tracked. Without the \fB-t\fR option, for each \fIname\fR in the argument list for which no \fIvalue\fR is specified, the name and value of the alias is printed. The obsolete -x option has no effect.

If \fIname\fR is not specified, and no \fB-f\fR option is specified, the built-ins are printed on standard output. The \fB-s\fR option prints only the special built-ins. Otherwise, each \fIname\fR represents the pathname whose basename is the name of the built-in. The entry point function name is determined by prepending \fIb\fR to the built-in name. The ISO C/C++ prototype is \fBb\fR\fImycommand(int argc, char *argv[], void *context)\fR for the built-in command \fImycommand\fR where \fIargv\fR is an array of \fIargc\fR elements and \fIcontext\fR is an optional pointer to a \fBShell_t\fR structure as described in \fB<ast/shell.h>\fR Special built-ins cannot be bound to a pathname or deleted. The \fB-d\fR option deletes each of the specified built-ins. On systems that support dynamic loading, the \fB-f\fR option names a shared library containing the code for built-ins. The shared library prefix and/or suffix, which depend on the system, can be omitted. Once a library is loaded, its symbols become available for subsequent invocations of \fBbuiltin\fR. Multiple libraries can be specified with separate invocations of the \fBbuiltin\fR command. Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which they are specified. When a library is loaded, it looks for a function in the library whose name is \fBlib_init()\fR and invokes this function with an argument of \fB0\fR.

This command has two forms. 
.sp
In the first form it changes the current directory to \fIarg\fR. If \fIarg\fR is a \fB-\fR, the directory is changed to the previous directory. The shell variable \fBHOME\fR is the default \fIarg\fR. The variable \fBPWD\fR is set to the current directory. The shell variable \fBCDPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory containing \fIarg\fR. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). The default path is \fBNULL\fR (specifying the current directory). The current directory is specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal sign or between the colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If \fIarg\fR begins with a \fB/\fR, the search path is not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for \fIarg\fR. 
.sp
The second form of \fBcd\fR substitutes the string \fInew\fR for the string \fIold\fR in the current directory name, \fBPWD\fR, and tries to change to this new directory. By default, symbolic link names are treated literally when finding the directory name. This is equivalent to the \fB-L\fR option. The \fB-P\fR option causes symbolic links to be resolved when determining the directory. The last instance of \fB-L\fR or \fB-P\fR on the command line determines which method is used. The \fBcd\fR command cannot be executed by \fBrksh\fR.

Without the \fB-v\fR or \fB-V\fR options, executes \fIname\fR with the arguments specified by \fIarg\fR. 
.sp
The \fB-p\fR option causes a default path to be searched rather than the one defined by the value of \fBPATH\fR. Functions are not searched when finding \fIname\fR. In addition, if \fIname\fR refers to a special built-in, none of the special properties associated with the leading daggers are honored. For example, the predefined alias \fBredirect='command exec'\fR prevents a script from terminating when an invalid redirection is specified. 
.sp
With the \fB-x\fR option, if command execution would result in a failure because there are too many arguments, \fBerrno E2BIG\fR, the shell invokes command \fIname\fR multiple times with a subset of the arguments on each invocation. Arguments that occur prior to the first word that expands to multiple arguments and after the last word that expands to multiple arguments are passed on each invocation. The exit status is the maximum invocation exit status. 
.sp
With the \fB-v\fR option, \fBcommand\fR is equivalent to the built-in \fBwhence\fR command described in this section. The \fB-V\fR option causes \fBcommand\fR to act like \fBwhence -v\fR.

Checks \fIarg\fR for legal options. If \fIarg\fR is omitted, the positional parameters are used. An option argument begins with a \fB+\fR or a \fB-\fR. An option that does not begin with \fB+\fR or \fB-\fR or the argument \fB--\fR ends the options. Options beginning with \fB+\fR are only recognized when \fIoptstring\fR begins with a \fB+\fR. \fIoptstring\fR contains the letters that \fBgetopts\fR recognizes. If a letter is followed by a \fB:\fR, that option is expected to have an argument. The options can be separated from the argument by blanks. The option \fB-?\fRcauses \fBgetopts\fR to generate a usage message on standard error. The \fB-a\fR option can be used to specify the name to use for the usage message, which defaults to $0. \fBgetopts\fR places the next option letter it finds inside variable \fIvname\fR each time it is invoked. The option letter is prepended with a \fB+\fR when \fIarg\fR begins with a \fB+\fR. The index of the next \fIarg\fR is stored in \fBOPTIND\fR. The option argument, if any, gets stored in \fBOPTARG\fR. A leading : in \fIoptstring\fR causes \fBgetopts\fR to store the letter of an invalid option in \fBOPTARG\fR, and to set \fIvname\fR to \fB?\fR for an unknown option and to: when a required option argument is missing. Otherwise, \fBgetopts\fR prints an error message. The exit status is \fBnon-zero\fR when there are no more options. There is no way to specify any of the options \fB:\fR, \fB+\fR, \fB-\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB[\fR, and \fB]\fR. The option \fB#\fR can only be specified as the first option.

The arguments \fIarg\fR are printed on standard output in accordance with the \fBANSI-C\fR formatting rules associated with the format string \fIformat\fR. If the number of arguments exceeds the number of format specifications, the format string is reused to format remaining arguments. The following extensions can also be used: A \fB%b\fR format can be used instead of \fB%s\fR to cause escape sequences in the corresponding \fIarg\fR to be expanded as described in \fBprint\fR. A \fB%B\fR option causes each of the arguments to be treated as variable names and the binary value of the variables is printed. This is most useful for variables with an attribute of b. A \fB%H\fR format can be used instead of \fB%s\fR to cause characters in \fIarg\fR that are special in \fBHTML\fR and \fBXML\fR to be output as their entity name. A \fB%P\fR format can be used instead of \fB%s\fR to cause \fIarg\fR to be interpreted as an extended regular expression and be printed as a shell pattern. A \fB%R\fR format can be used instead of \fB%s\fR to cause \fIarg\fR to be interpreted as a shell pattern and to be printed as an extended regular expression. A \fB%q\fR format can be used instead of \fB%\fRs to cause the resulting string to be quoted in a manner than can be input again to the shell. A \fB%(\fR\fIdate-format\fR\fB)T\fR format can be use to treat an argument as a date/time string and to format the date/time according to the \fIdate-format\fR as defined for the \fBdate\fR(1) command. A \fB%Z\fR format outputs a byte whose value is 0. The precision field of the %d format can be followed by a . and the output base. In this case, the \fB#\fR flag character causes \fBbase\fR\fI#\fR to be prepended. The \fB#\fR flag when used with the \fBd\fR specifier without an output base, causes the output to be displayed in thousands units with one of the suffixes \fBk\fR \fBM\fR \fBG\fR \fBT\fR \fBP\fR \fBE\fR to indicate the unit. The \fB#\fR flag when used with the i specifier causes the output to be displayed in \fB1024\fR with one of the suffixes \fBKi\fR \fBMi\fR \fBGi\fR \fBTi\fR \fBPi\fR \fBEi\fR to indicate the unit.

The shell input mechanism. One line is read and is broken up into fields using the characters in IFS as separators. The escape character, \fB\e\fR, is used to remove any special meaning for the next character and for line continuation. The \fB-d\fR option causes the read to continue to the first character of \fIdelim\fR rather than \fBNEWLINE\fR. The \fB-n\fR option causes at most \fIn\fR bytes to read rather a full line but returns when reading from a slow device as soon as any characters have been read. The \fB-N\fR option causes exactly \fIn\fR to be read unless an end-of-file has been encountered or the read times out because of the \fB-t\fR option. In raw mode, \fB-r\fR, the \fB\e\fR character is not treated specially. The first field is assigned to the first \fIvname\fR, the second field to the second \fIvname\fR, etc., with leftover fields assigned to the last \fIvname\fR. When \fIvname\fR has the binary attribute and \fB-n\fR or \fB-N\fR is specified, the bytes that are read are stored directly into the variable. If the -v is specified, then the value of the first \fIvname\fR is used as a default value when reading from a terminal device. The \fB-A\fR option causes the variable \fIvname\fR to be unset and each field that is read to be stored in successive elements of the indexed array \fIvname\fR. The \fB-p\fR option causes the input line to be taken from the input pipe of a process spawned by the shell using \fB|&\fR. If the \fB-s\fR option is present, the input is saved as a command in the history file. The option \fB-u\fR can be used to specify a one digit file descriptor unit \fIunit\fR to read from. The file descriptor can be opened with the \fBexec\fR special built-in command. The default value of unit \fIn\fR is \fB0\fR. The option \fB-t\fR is used to specify a time out in seconds when reading from a terminal or pipe. If \fIvname\fR is omitted, then REPLY is used as the default \fIvname\fR. An end-of-file with the \fB-p\fR option causes cleanup for this process so that another can be spawned. If the first argument contains a \fB?\fR, the remainder of this word is used as a prompt on standard error when the shell is interactive. The exit status is \fB0\fR unless an end-of-file is encountered or read has timed out.

The \fB-p\fR option causes the trap action associated with each trap as specified by the arguments to be printed with appropriate quoting. Otherwise, \fIaction\fR is processed as if it were an argument to \fBeval\fR when the shell receives signal(s) \fIsig\fR. Each \fIsig\fR can be specified as a number or as the name of the signal. Trap commands are executed in order of signal number. Any attempt to set a trap on a signal that was ignored on entry to the current shell is ineffective. If \fIaction\fR is omitted and the first \fIsig\fR is a number, or if \fIaction\fR is \fB-\fR, then the trap(s) for each \fIsig\fR are reset to their original values. If \fIaction\fR is the null string then this signal is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If \fIsig\fR is \fBERR\fR then \fIaction\fR is executed whenever a command has a \fBnon-zero\fR exit status. If \fIsig\fR is \fBDEBUG\fR then \fIaction\fR is executed before each command. The variable \fB\&.sh.command\fR contains the contents of the current command line when \fIaction\fR is running. If \fIsig\fR is \fB0\fR or \fBEXIT\fR and the trap statement is executed inside the body of a function defined with the \fBfunction\fR \fIname\fR syntax, then the command \fIaction\fR is executed after the function completes. If \fIsig\fR is \fB0\fR or \fBEXIT\fR for a trap set outside any function then the command \fIaction\fR is executed on exit from the shell. If \fIsig\fR is \fBKEYBD\fR, then \fIaction\fR is executed whenever a key is read while in \fBemacs\fR, \fBgmacs\fR, or \fBvi\fR mode. The \fBtrap\fR command with no arguments prints a list of commands associated with each signal number.

.SS "Invocation"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked by \fBexec\fR(2), and the first character of argument zero (\fB$0\fR) is \fB-\fR, then the shell is assumed to be a login shell and commands are read from \fB/etc/profile\fR and then from either .\fBprofile\fR in the current directory or \fB$HOME/.profile\fR, if either file exists. Next, for interactive shells, commands are read first from \fB/etc/ksh.kshrc\fR, and then from the file named by performing parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution on the value of the environment variable \fBENV\fR if the file exists. If the \fB-s\fR option is not present and \fIarg\fR and a file by the name of \fIarg\fR exists, then it reads and executes this script. Otherwise, if the first \fIarg\fR does not contain a \fB/\fR, a path search is performed on the first \fIarg\fR to determine the name of the script to execute. The script \fIarg\fR must have execute permission and any \fBsetuid\fR and \fBsetgid\fR settings are ignored. If the script is not found on the path, \fIarg\fR is processed as if it named a built-in command or function.

When a command to be executed is found to be a shell procedure, \fBrksh\fR invokes \fBksh\fR to execute it. Thus, it is possible to provide to the end-user shell procedures that have access to the full power of the standard shell, while imposing a limited menu of commands. This scheme assumes that the end-user does not have write and execute permissions in the same directory. The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the .\fBprofile\fR has complete control over user actions, by performing guaranteed setup actions and leaving the user in an appropriate directory (probably not the login directory). The system administrator often sets up a directory of commands, for example, \fB/usr/rbin\fR, that can be safely invoked by \fBrksh\fR.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
\fBksh\fR scripts should choose shell function names outside the namespace used by reserved keywords of the ISO C99, C++ and JAVA languages to avoid collisions with future enhancements to \fBksh\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a command is executed, and then a command with the same name is installed in a directory in the search path before the directory where the original command was found, the shell continues to \fBexec\fR the original command. Use the \fB-t\fR option of the alias command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
Some very old shell scripts contain a caret (\fB^\fR) as a synonym for the pipe character (\fB|\fR).
.sp
.LP
Using the \fBhist\fR built-in command within a compound command causes the whole command to disappear from the history file.
.sp
.LP
The built-in command \fB\&.\fR \fIfile\fR reads the whole file before any commands are executed. \fBalias\fR and \fBunalias\fR commands in the file do not apply to any commands defined in the file.
.sp
.LP
Traps are not processed while a job is waiting for a foreground process. Thus, a trap on \fBCHLD\fR is not executed until the foreground job terminates.
.sp
.LP
It is a good idea to leave a space after the comma operator in arithmetic expressions to prevent the comma from being interpreted as the decimal point character in certain locales. 
.sp

There might be some restrictions on creating a \fB\&.paths\fR file which is portable across other operating systems.
.sp

If the system supports the 64-bit instruction set, \fB/bin/ksh\fR executes the 64-bit version of \fBksh\fR.
