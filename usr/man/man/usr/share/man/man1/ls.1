.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
For each \fIfile\fR that is a directory, \fBls\fR lists the contents of the directory. For each \fIfile\fR that is an ordinary file, \fBls\fR repeats its name and any other information requested. The output is sorted alphabetically by default. When no argument is given, the current directory (\fB\&.\fR) is listed. When several arguments are given, the arguments are first sorted appropriately, but file arguments appear before directories and their contents.
.sp
.LP
There are three major listing formats. The default format for output directed to a terminal is multi\(micolumn with entries sorted down the columns. The \fB-1\fR option allows single column output and \fB-m\fR enables stream output format. In order to determine output formats for the \fB-C\fR, \fB-x\fR, and \fB-m\fR options, \fBls\fR uses an environment variable, \fBCOLUMNS\fR, to determine the number of character positions available on one output line. If this variable is not set, the \fBterminfo\fR(4) database is used to determine the number of columns, based on the environment variable, \fBTERM\fR. If this information cannot be obtained, 80 columns are assumed. If the \fB-w\fR option is used, the argument overrides any other column width.
.sp
.LP
The mode printed when the \fB-e\fR, \fB-E\fR, \fB-g\fR, \fB-l\fR, \fB-n\fR, \fB-o\fR, \fB-v\fR, \fB-V\fR, or \fB-@\fR option is in effect consists of eleven characters. The first character can be one of the following:

.LP
The next 9 characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The first set refers to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions of others in the user-group of the file; and the last to all others. Within each set, the three characters indicate permission to read, to write, and to execute the file as a program, respectively. For a directory, \fBexecute\fR permission is interpreted to mean permission to search the directory for a specified file. The character after permissions is an ACL or extended attributes indicator. This character is an \fB@\fR if extended attributes are associated with the file and the \fB-@\fR option is in effect. Otherwise, this character is a plus sign (\fB+\fR) character if a non-trivial ACL is associated with the file or a space character if not.
.sp
.LP
If \fB-/\fR and/or \fB-%\fR are in effect, then the extended system attributes are printed when filesystem supports extended system attributes. The display looks as follows: 
.sp

.LP
Reading from right to left, you see that the current directory holds one file, named \fBpart2\fR. Next, the last time that file's contents were modified was \fB9:42 A.M.\fR on \fBMay 16\fR. The file contains 10,876 characters, or bytes. The owner of the file, or the user, belongs to the group \fBdev\fR (perhaps indicating \fBdevelopment\fR), and his or her login name is \fBsmith\fR. The number, in this case \fB1\fR, indicates the number of links to file \fBpart2\fR (see \fBcp\fR(1)). The plus sign indicates that there is an \fBACL\fR associated with the file. If the \fB-@\fR option has been specified, the presence of extended attributes supersede the presence of an \fBACL\fR and the plus sign is replaced with an 'at' sign (\fB@\fR). Finally, the dash and letters tell you that user, group, and others have permissions to read, write, and execute \fBpart2\fR.
.sp
.LP
The execute (\fBx\fR) symbol occupies the third position of the three-character sequence. A \fB\(mi\fR in the third position would have indicated a denial of execution permissions.

.RE

.sp
.LP
For user and group permissions, the third position is sometimes occupied by a character other than \fBx\fR or \fB-\fR. \fBs\fR or \fBS\fR also can occupy this position, referring to the state of the set-ID bit, whether it be the user's or the group's. The ability to assume the same ID as the user during execution is, for example, used during login when you begin as root but need to assume the identity of the user you login as.
.sp
.LP
In the case of the sequence of group permissions, \fBl\fR can occupy the third position. \fBl\fR refers to mandatory file and record locking. This permission describes a file's ability to allow other files to lock its reading or writing permissions during access.
.sp
.LP
For others permissions, the third position can be occupied by \fBt\fR or \fBT\fR. These refer to the state of the sticky bit and execution permissions.
.SS "Color Output"
.sp
.LP
If color output is enabled, the environment variable LS_COLORS is checked.  If it exists, its contents are used to control the colors used to display filenames.  If it is not set, a default list of colors is used. The format of LS_COLORS is a colon separated list of attribute specifications. Each attribute specification is of the format

On some terminals, setting the bold attribute causes the foreground colors to be high-intensity, that is, brighter. In such cases the low-intensity yellow is often displayed as a brown or orange color.
.sp
.LP
At least one attribute must be listed for a file specification.
.sp

The appropriate color codes are chosen by selecting the most specific match, starting with the file suffixes and proceeding with the file types until a match is found. The \fBno\fR (normal file) type matches any file.

Unprintable characters in file names can confuse the columnar output options.

The total block count is incorrect if there are hard links among the files.

The sort order of \fBls\fR output is affected by the locale and can be overridden by the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR environment variable. For example, if \fBLC_COLLATE\fR equals \fBC\fR, dot files appear first, followed by names beginning with upper-case letters, then followed by names beginning with lower-case letters. But if \fBLC_COLLATE\fR equals \fBen_US.ISO8859-1\fR, then leading dots as well as case are ignored in determining the sort order.
