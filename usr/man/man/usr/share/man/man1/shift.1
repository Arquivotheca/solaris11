.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "sh"
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters from \fB$\fR\fIn\fR\fB+1\fR .\|.\|. are renamed \fB$1\fR .\|.\|. . If \fIn\fR is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.
.SS "csh"
.sp
.LP
The components of \fIargv\fR, or \fIvariable\fR, if supplied, are shifted to the left, discarding the first component. It is an error for the variable not to be set or to have a null value.
.SS "ksh88"
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters from \fB$\fR\fIn\fR\fB+1\fR \fB$\fR\fIn\fR\fB+1 .\|.\|.\fR are renamed \fB$1 .\|.\|.\fR, default \fIn\fR is 1. The parameter \fIn\fR can be any arithmetic expression that evaluates to a non-negative number less than or equal to \fB$#\fR.

On this manual page, \fBksh88\fR(1) commands that are preceded by one or two * (asterisks) are treated specially in the following ways:
.RS +4
.TP
1.
Variable assignment lists preceding the command remain in effect when the command completes.
.RE

2.
\fBI/O\fR redirections are processed after variable assignments.

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
4.
Words, following a command preceded by ** that are in the format of a variable assignment, are expanded with the same rules as a variable assignment. This means that tilde substitution is performed after the \fB=\fR sign and word splitting and file name generation are not performed.

.LP
\fBshift\fR is a shell special built-in that shifts the positional parameters to the left by the number of places defined by \fIn\fR, or \fB1\fR if \fIn\fR is omitted. The number of positional parameters remaining is reduced by the number of places that are shifted.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified, it is evaluated as an arithmetic expression to determine the number of places to shift. It is an error to shift more than the number of positional parameters or a negative number of places.
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned by \fBshift\fR in \fBksh\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt  
Successful completion. The positional parameters were successfully shifted.

.sp
.ne 2
