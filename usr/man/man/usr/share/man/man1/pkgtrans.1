The options and arguments for this command are:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIalias\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Use public key certificate associated with friendlyName alias, and the corresponding private key. See \fBKEYSTORE LOCATIONS\fR and \fBKEYSTORE AND CERTIFICATE FORMATS\fR in \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for more information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Sign resulting datastream.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Copies only the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) and \fBpkgmap\fR(4) files.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIkeystore\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Use keystore to retrieve private key used to generate signature. If it not specified, default locations are searched to find the specified private key specified by \fB-a\fR. If no alias is given, and multiple keys exist in the key store, \fBpkgtrans\fR will abort. See \fBKEYSTORE LOCATIONS\fR and \fBKEYSTORE AND CERTIFICATE FORMATS\fR in \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for more information on search locations and formats.
.sp
When running as a user other than root, the default base directory for certificate searching is \fB~/.pkg/security\fR, where \fB~\fR is the home directory of the user invoking \fBpkgtrans\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Creates a new instance of the package on the destination device if any instance of this package already exists, up to the number specified by the \fBMAXINST\fR variable in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Overwrites the same instance on the destination device. Package instance will be overwritten if it already exists.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIpasswd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Supply password used to decrypt the keystore. See \fBPASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS\fR in \fBpkgadd\fR(1M) for details on the syntax of the argument to this option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Indicates that the package should be written to \fIdevice2\fR as a datastream rather than as a file system. The default behavior is to write a file system format on devices that support both formats.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdevice1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Indicates the source device. The package or packages on this device will be translated and placed on \fIdevice2\fR. See DEVICE SPECIFIERS, below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIdevice2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Indicates the destination device. Translated packages will be placed on this device. See DEVICE SPECIFIERS, below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIpkginst\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Specifies which package instance or instances on \fIdevice1\fR should be translated. The token \fBall\fR may be used to indicate all packages. \fBpkginst.*\fR can be used to indicate all instances of a package. If no packages are defined, a prompt shows all packages on the device and asks which to translate.
.sp
The asterisk character (\fB*\fR) is a special character to some shells and may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, the \fB*\fR must be surrounded by single quotes (\fB\&'\fR) or preceded by a backslash (\fB\e\fR).
.RE

.SH DEVICE SPECIFIERS
.sp
.LP
Packaging tools, including \fBpkgtrans\fR, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), and \fBpkgchk\fR(1M), have options for specifying a package location by specifying the device on which it resides. Listed below are the device types that a package can be stored to and retrieved from. Note that source and destination devices cannot be the same.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdevice\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Packages can be stored to a character or block device by specifying the device identifier as the device. A common example of this device type is \fB/dev/rmt/0\fR for a removable magnetic tape. \fBpkgtrans\fR can also produce regular file system files in a stream format, which is suitable for storage on a character device, web server, or as input to \fBpkgadd\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdirectory\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
.rt  
Packages can be stored onto a directory by specifying an absolute path to a file system directory. The package contents reside in a directory within the specified directory. The package directory name must be identical to its \fBPKG\fR specification in the \fBpkginfo\fR(4) file. An example device specification of this type is \fB/export/packages\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRTranslating Packages on \fB/tmp\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example translates packages \fBpkg1\fR and \fBpkg2\fR on \fB/tmp\fR into a datastream format:

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpkgtrans\fR does not translate any instance of a package if any instance of that package already exists on the destination device. Using the \fB-n\fR option creates a new instance if an instance of this package already exists. Using the \fB-o\fR option overwrites an instance of this package if it already exists. Neither of these options are useful if the destination device is a datastream.
.sp
.LP
Package commands are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR and other package commands can process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
