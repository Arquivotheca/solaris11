.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlast\fR [\fB-a\fR] [\fB-n\fR \fInumber\fR | \fB-number\fR] [\fB-f\fR \fIfilename\fR] 
     [\fIname\fR | \fItty\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBlast\fR command looks in the \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR file, which records all logins and logouts, for information about a user, a terminal, or any group of users and terminals. Arguments specify names of users or terminals of interest. If multiple arguments are given, the information applicable to any of the arguments is printed. For example, \fBlast\fR \fBroot\fR \fBconsole\fR lists all of root's sessions, as well as all sessions on the console terminal. \fBlast\fR displays the sessions of the specified users and terminals, most recent first, indicating the times at which the session began, the duration of the session, and the terminal on which the session took place. \fBlast\fR also indicates whether the session is continuing or was cut short by a reboot.
.sp
.LP
The pseudo-user reboot logs in when the system is shutdown and when it reboots. Thus, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
last reboot
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
gives an approximate record of when the operating system instance was shutdown and when it rebooted. This can be used to calculate the availability of the operating system over time. 
.sp
.LP
\fBlast\fR with no arguments displays a record of all logins and logouts, in reverse order.
.sp
.LP
If \fBlast\fR is interrupted, it indicates how far the search has progressed in \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR. If interrupted with a quit signal (generated by a CTRL\(mi\e), \fBlast\fR indicates how far the search has progressed, and then continues the search.
