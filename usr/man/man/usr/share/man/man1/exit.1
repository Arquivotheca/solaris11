.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "sh"
.sp
.LP
\fBexit\fR causes the calling shell or shell script to exit with the exit status specified by \fIn\fR. If \fIn\fR is omitted the exit status is that of the last command executed (an \fBEOF\fR also causes the shell to exit.)
.sp
.LP
\fBreturn\fR causes a function to exit with the return value specified by \fIn\fR. If \fIn\fR is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed.
.SS "csh"
.sp
.LP
\fBexit\fR causes the calling shell or shell script to exit, either with the value of the status variable or with the value specified by the expression \fBexpr\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgoto\fR built-in uses a specified \fIlabel\fR as a search string amongst commands. The shell rewinds its input as much as possible and searches for a line of the form \fIlabel\fR\fB:\fR possibly preceded by space or tab characters. Execution continues after the indicated line. It is an error to jump to a label that occurs between a \fBwhile\fR or \fBfor\fR built-in command and its corresponding \fBend\fR.
.SS "ksh88"
.sp
.LP
\fBexit\fR causes the calling shell or shell script to exit with the exit status specified by \fIn\fR. The value is the least significant 8 bits of the specified status. If \fIn\fR is omitted then the exit status is that of the last command executed. When \fBexit\fR occurs when executing a trap, the last command refers to the command that executed before the trap was invoked. An end-of-file also causes the shell to exit except for a shell which has the \fBignoreeof\fR option (See \fBset\fR below) turned on.
.sp
.LP
\fBreturn\fR causes a shell function or \fB\&'.'\fR script to return to the invoking script with the return status specified by \fIn\fR. The value is the least significant 8 bits of the specified status. If \fIn\fR is omitted then the return status is that of the last command executed. If \fBreturn\fR is invoked while not in a function or a \fB\&'.'\fR script, then it is the same as an \fBexit\fR.

\fBexit\fR is shell special built-in that causes the shell that invokes it to exit. Before exiting the shell, if the \fBEXIT\fR trap is set, it is invoked.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified, it is used to set the exit status.

.LP
\fBreturn\fR is a shell special built-in that causes the function or dot script that invokes it to exit. If \fBreturn\fR is invoked outside of a \fBfunction\fR or dot script it is equivalent to \fBexit\fR. 
.sp
.LP
If \fBreturn\fR is invoked inside a function defined with the \fBfunction\fR reserved word syntax, then any \fBEXIT\fR trap set within the function is invoked in the context of the caller before the function returns. 
.sp

If \fIn\fR is specified, it is used to set the exit status.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.SS "ksh"
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified for \fBexit\fR, the exit status is the least significant eight bits of the value of \fIn\fR. Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status of preceding command. When invoked inside a trap, the preceding command means the command that invoked the trap.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is specified for \fBreturn\fR, the exit status is the least significant eight bits of the value of \fIn\fR. Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status of preceding command.
