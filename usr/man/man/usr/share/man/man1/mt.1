.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmt\fR [\fB-f\fR \fItapename\fR] \fIcommand\fR... [\fIcount\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmt\fR utility sends commands to a magnetic tape drive. If \fB-f\fR \fItapename\fR is not specified, the environment variable \fBTAPE\fR is used. If \fBTAPE\fR does not exist, \fBmt\fR uses the device \fB/dev/rmt/0n\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fItapename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Specifies the raw tape device.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcount\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The number of times that the requested operation is to be performed. By default, \fBmt\fR performs \fIcommand\fR once. Multiple operations of \fIcommand\fR can be performed by specifying \fIcount\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
The following available commands that can be sent to a magnetic tape drive are supported. Only as many characters as are required to uniquely identify a \fIcommand\fR need be specified.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBasf\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Specifies absolute space to \fIcount\fR file number. This is equivalent to a \fBrewind\fR followed by a \fBfsf\fR \fIcount\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbsf\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Back spaces over \fIcount\fR EOF marks. The tape is positioned on the beginning-of-tape side of the EOF mark.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbsr\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBbssf\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
Back spaces over the requested number of sequential file marks. Sequential file marks are where the file marks are one right after the other with no other blocks of any kind between the file marks. The number argument specifies how many sequential file marks to which to space. For example, \fBbssf 4\fR searches backwards to the first place where there are 4 sequential file marks and positions to the BOP side of the 4th file mark. 
.sp
This command is not supported by all drives.

Some tape drives have option settings where only portions of the tape can be erased. Be sure to select the correct setting to erase the whole tape. Erasing a tape can take a long time depending on the device and/or tape. Refer to the device specific manual for time details.

.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
Not all devices support all options. Some options are hardware-dependent. Refer to the corresponding device manual page.
.sp
.LP
\fBmt\fR is architecture sensitive. Heterogeneous operation (that is, SPARC to x86 or the reverse) is not supported.
