.SH NAME
vntsd \- virtual network terminal server daemon for Logical Domains
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/ldoms/vntsd\fR 
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvntsd\fR daemon is a server that supports connections to the Logical Domains (LDoms) console by using \fBtelnet\fR(1). When a \fBtelnet\fR session starts, \fBvntsd\fR sends \fBtelnet\fR options to the client indicating a willingness to remotely echo characters and to suppress go ahead.
.sp
.LP
Consoles are organized into groups by the LDoms Manager. Each console group is assigned a unique group name and TCP port number. \fBvntsd\fR uses the group's port number to export access to the consoles within that group. To establish a connection with a console or console group, a user starts a \fBtelnet\fR(1) session with the corresponding group's port number. Depending on the number of consoles within that group, \fBvntsd\fR does one of two things:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If there is only one console in the group, \fBvntsd\fR connects a session to that LDoms console.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If there are multiple consoles in the group, \fBvntsd\fR prompts the user to select the console to which they would like to connect, as shown in "Multiple-Console Options," below.
.RE
.sp
.LP
For each console, \fBvntsd\fR provides write access only to the first user connecting to the console. Subsequent users connecting to the console are allowed only to read from the console and wait for write access. When the first user disconnects, write privileges are transferred to the next user waiting in the queue. If a user who does not have write privileges attempts to write to a console, the \fBvntsd\fR displays the following message:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
You do not have write access
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
A user who has no write access can acquire write access forcibly by using the \fB~w\fR special console command, described in "Special Console Commands," below.
.sp
.LP
\fBvntsd\fR can be invoked only with superuser privileges or by someone in the Primary Administrator role.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The options for \fBvntsd\fR are divided into multiple-console options and console commands.
.SS "Multiple-Console Options"
.sp
.LP
The options listed below are supported when there are multiple LDoms consoles in a group. The syntax for the use of these options is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fI<hostname>\fR-vnts-\fI<group-name>\fR: \fI<option>\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
myhost-vnts-salesgroup: h
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBh\fR option invokes help, as described below.

.sp

.SS "Special Console Commands"

.LP
A tilde (\fB~\fR) appearing as the first character of a line is an escape signal that directs \fBvntsd\fR to perform a special console command. The tilde-tilde (\fB~~\fR) sequence outputs a tilde. In conjunction with the initial tilde, \fBvntsd\fR accepts the following special console commands:

You can change the following properties using the \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) command:

\fB\fBvntsd/vcc_device\fR\fR

.sp .6

.sp
.in +2
.nf
vntsd/listen_addr:"\fIxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\fR"
.fi
.in -2

\&...where \fIxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\fR is a valid IP address. The default value of this property is to listen on IP address 127.0.0.1. Users can connect to a guest console over a network if the value is set to the IP address of the control domain.
.LP
Note - 
.sp
.RS 2
Enabling network access to a console has security implications. Any user can connect to a console and for this reason it is disabled by default.

\fB\fBvntsd/timeout_minutes\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set timeout in minutes. \fBvntsd\fR will timeout (close) \fBtelnet\fR connection if there is no activity (input or output) on the console. The default value is 0, which disables timeout.
.RE

.sp

\fB\fBvntsd/authorization\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable the authorization checking of users and roles for the domain console or consoles that are being accessed. The default value of this property is \fBfalse\fR to maintain backward compatibility. To enable authorization checking, use the \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) command to set the property value to \fBtrue\fR. While this option is enabled, \fBvntsd\fR listens and accepts connections on \fBlocalhost\fR. If the \fBlisten_addr\fR property specifies an alternate IP address when this option is enabled, \fBvntsd\fR ignores the alternate IP address and continues to listen on \fBlocalhost\fR. Connections that are initiated from other hosts will also fail. Authorizations are available to access all consoles or console groups, or to access specific consoles or console groups. When the \fBvntsd\fR service is enabled, the following authorization is added to the authorization description database, \fBauth_attr\fR(4):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
solaris.vntsd.consoles:::Access All LDoms Guest Consoles::
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Add any fine-grained authorizations based on the name of the console group. For example, if the name of the console group to be authorized is \fBldg1\fR, add the following entry to the \fBauth_attr\fR(4) file:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
solaris.vntsd.console-ldg1:::Access Specific LDoms Guest Console::
.fi
.in -2
.sp

By default, the authorization to access all consoles is assigned to the root user or role. The Primary Administrator (superuser) can use the \fBusermod\fR(1M) command to assign the required authorization or authorizations to other users or roles.
.sp
The following example gives user \fBuser1\fR the authorization to access all domain consoles:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBusermod -A "solaris.vntsd.consoles" user1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The following example gives user \fBuser1\fR the authorization to access the console group named \fBldg1\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBusermod -A "solaris.vntsd.console-ldg1" user1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
