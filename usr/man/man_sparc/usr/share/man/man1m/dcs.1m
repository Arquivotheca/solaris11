.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Domain Configuration Server (DCS) is a daemon process that runs on Sun servers that support remote Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR) clients. It is started by the Service Management Facility (see \fBsmf\fR(5)) when the first DR request is received from a client connecting to the network service \fBsun-dr\fR. After the DCS accepts a DR request, it uses the \fBlibcfgadm\fR(3LIB) interface to execute the DR operation. After the operation is performed, the results are returned to the client.
.sp
.LP
The DCS listens on the network service labeled \fBsun-dr\fR. Its underlying protocol is TCP. It is invoked as a server program by the SMF using the TCP transport. The fault management resource identifier (FMRI) for DCS is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If you disable this service, DR operations initiated from a remote host fail. There is no negative impact on the server.
.sp
.LP
Security for the DCS connection is provided differently based upon the architecture of the system. The SMF specifies the correct options when invoking the DCS daemon, based upon the current architecture. For all architectures, security is provided on a per-connection basis.
.sp
.LP
The DCS daemon has no security options that are applicable when used on a Sun Enterprise 10000 system. So there are no options applicable to that architecture.
.sp
.LP
The security options for Sun Fire high-end systems are based on IPsec options defined as SMF properties. These options include the \fB-a\fR \fIauth\fR, \fB-e\fR \fIencr\fR, and \fB-u\fR \fIesp_auth\fR options, and can be set using the \fBsvccfg\fR(1M) command. These options must match the IPsec policies defined for DCS on the system controller. Refer to the \fBkmd(1M)\fR man page in the \fISystem Management Services (SMS) Reference Manual\fR. The \fBkmd(1M)\fR man page is not part of the SunOS man page collection.
.sp
.LP
Security on SPARC Enterprise Servers is not configurable. The DCS daemon uses a platform-specific library to configure its security options when running on such systems. The \fB-l\fR option is provided by the SMF when invoking the DCS daemon on SPARC Enterprise Servers. No other security options to the DCS daemon should be used on SPARC Enterprise Servers.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\fB-a\fR \fIauth\fR\fR

Controls the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) algorithm. \fIauth\fR can be one of \fBnone\fR, \fBmd5\fR, or \fBsha1\fR.

\fB\fB-e\fR \fIencr\fR\fR

Controls the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encryption algorithm. \fIencr\fR can be one of \fBnone\fR, \fBdes\fR, or \fB3des\fR.

\fB\fB-l\fR\fR

Enables the use of platform-specific security options on SPARC Enterprise Servers.

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIsessions\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Sets the number of active sessions that the DCS allows at any one time. When the limit is reached, the DCS stops accepting connections until active sessions complete the execution of their DR operation. If this option is not specified, a default value of 128 is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIesp_auth\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
Controls the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) authentication algorithm. \fIesp_auth\fR can be one of \fBnone\fR, \fBmd5\fR, or \fBsha1\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSetting an IPSec Option
.sp
.LP
The following command sets the Authentication Header algorithm for the DCS daemon to use the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm. These settings are only applicable for using the DCS daemon on a Sun Fire high-end system.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/ah_auth = "md5"\fR
# \fBsvccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/esp_encr = "none"\fR
# \fBsvccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/esp_auth = "none"\fR
# \fBsvcadm refresh svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs\fR

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The DCS uses \fBsyslog\fR(3C) to report status and error messages. All of the messages are logged with the \fBLOG_DAEMON\fR facility. Error messages are logged with the \fBLOG_ERR\fR and \fBLOG_NOTICE\fR priorities, and informational messages are logged with the \fBLOG_INFO\fR priority. The default entries in the \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fR file log all of the DCS error messages to the \fB/var/adm/messages\fR log.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBdcs\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5), under the fault management resource identifier (FMRI):
