.SH NAME
n2cp \- Ultra-SPARC T2 crypto provider device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBn2cp\fR device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting hardware-assisted acceleration of the following cryptographic operations, which are built into the Ultra-SPARC T2 CMT processor:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
DES:    CKM_DES_CBC, CKM_DES_ECB
DES3:   CKM_DES3_CBC, CKM_DES3_ECB,
AES:    CKM_AES_CBC, CKM_AES_ECB, CKM_AES_CTR, CKM_AES_CCM, CKM_AES_GCM,
        CKM_AES_GMAC
RC4:    CKM_RC4
MD5:    KM_MD5, CKM_MD5_HMAC, CKM_MD5_HMAC_GENERAL, 
	       CKM_SSL3_MD5_MAC
SHA-1:  CKM_SHA_1, CKM_SHA_1_HMAC, 
        CKM_SHA_1_HMAC_GENERAL, CKM_SSL3_SHA1_MAC
SHA-256:CKM_SHA256, CKM_SHA256_HMAC, 
        CKM_SHA256_HMAC_GENERAL

.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
You configure the \fBn2cp\fR driver by defining properties in the \fB/platform/sun4v/kernel/drv/n2cp.conf\fR which override the default settings. The following property is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBnostats\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Disables the generation of statistics.  The \fBnostats\fR property may be used to help prevent traffic analysis, however, this may inhibit support personnel.
