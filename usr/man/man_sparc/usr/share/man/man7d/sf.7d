.SH SYNOPSIS

sf@\fIport\fR,0

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsf\fR driver is a SCSA compliant nexus driver which supports the Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI on Private Fibre Channel Arbitrated loops. An SBus card called the  \fBSOC+\fR card (see  \fBsocal\fR(7D)) connects the Fibre Channel loop to the host system.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsf\fR driver interfaces with the  \fBSOC+\fR device driver, \fBsocal\fR(7D), the SCSI disk target driver,  \fBssd\fR(7D), and the SCSI-3 Enclosure Services driver,  \fBses\fR(7D). It only supports SCSI devices of type disk and ses.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsf\fR driver supports the standard functions provided by the SCSA interface.  The driver supports auto request sense and tagged queueing by default.
.sp
.LP
The driver requires that all devices have unique hard addresses defined by switch settings in hardware.  Devices with conflicting hard addresses will not be accessible.

.sp
.LP
In addition to being logged, the messages below may display on the system console.
.sp
.LP
The first set of messages indicate that the attachment was unsuccessful, and will only display while the  \fBsf\fR driver is initially attempting to attach.  Each message is preceded by  \fBsf\fR\fI%d\fR , where  \fI%d\fR is the instance number of the  \fBsf\fR device.
