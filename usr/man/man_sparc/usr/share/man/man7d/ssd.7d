ssd \- Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop disk device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBssd@\fR\fIport\fR\fB,\fR\fItarget\fR\fB:\fR\fIpartition\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBssd\fR driver supports Fibre Channel disk devices.
.sp
.LP
The specific type of each disk is determined by the \fBSCSI\fR inquiry command and reading the volume label stored on block 0 of the drive. The volume label describes the disk geometry and partitioning; it must be present or the disk cannot be mounted by the system.
.sp
.LP
The block-files access the disk using the system's normal buffering mechanism and are read and written without regard to physical disk records. A "raw" interface provides for direct transmission between the disk and the read or write buffer. A single read or write call usually results in one I/O operation; raw I/O is therefore more efficient when many bytes are transmitted. Block file names are found in \fB/dev/dsk\fR; the names of the raw files are found in \fB/dev/rdsk\fR.
.sp
.LP
I/O requests (such as \fBlseek\fR(2)) to the \fBSCSI\fR disk must have an offset that is a multiple of 512 bytes (\fBDEV_BSIZE\fR), or the driver returns an \fBEINVAL\fR error. If the transfer length is not a multiple of 512 bytes, the transfer count is rounded up by the driver.
.sp
.LP
Partition 0 is normally used for the root file system on a disk, with partition 1 as a paging area (for example, \fBswap\fR). Partition 2 is used to back up the entire disk. Partition 2 normally maps the entire disk and may also be used as the mount point for secondary disks in the system. The rest of the disk is normally partition 6. For the primary disk, the user file system is located here.
.sp
.LP
The device has associated error statistics. These must include counters for hard errors, soft errors and transport errors. Other data may be implemented as required.
.SH DEVICE STATISTICS SUPPORT
.sp
.LP
The device maintains I/O statistics for the device and for partitions allocated for that device. For each device/partition, the  driver accumulates reads, writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The driver also initiates hi-resolution time stamps at queue entry and exit points to enable monitoring of residence time and cumulative residence-length product for each queue.  
.sp
.LP
Not all device drivers make per-partition IO statistics available for reporting. \fBssd\fR and \fBsd\fR(7D) per-partition statistics are  enabled by default but may be disabled in their configuration files.
.SH IOCTLS
.sp
.LP
Refer to  \fBdkio\fR(7I).

.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
You configure the \fBssd\fR driver by defining  properties in the \fBssd.conf\fR file. The \fBssd\fR driver supports the following properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBenable-partition-kstats\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
The default value is 1, which causes partition IO statistics to be maintained. Set this value to zero to prevent the driver from recording partition statistics. This slightly reduces the CPU overhead for IO, mimimizes the amount of \fBsar\fR(1) data collected and makes these statistics unavailable for reporting by \fBiostat\fR(1M) even though the \fB-p\fR/\fB-P\fR option is specified.  Regardless of this setting, disk IO statistics are always maintained.
.RE

.sp
.LP
In addition to the above properties, some device-specific tunables can be configured in \fBssd.conf\fR using the 'ssd-config-list' global property. The value of this property is a list of duplets. The formal syntax is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ssd-config-list = 	<duplet> [, <duplet> ]* ;

where 

<duplet>:=        "<vid+pid>" , "<tunable-list>"

and 

<tunable-list>:=   <tunable>  [, <tunable> ]*;
<tunable> =        <name> : <value>

The <vid+pid> is the string that is returned by the target device
on a SCSI inquiry command.

The <tunable-list> contains one or more tunables to apply to
all target devices with the specified <vid+pid>.

Each <tunable> is a <name> : <value> pair. Supported
tunable names are:
  
   delay-busy:	when busy, nsecs of delay before retry.
   
   retries-timeout:	retries to perform on an IO timeout.
