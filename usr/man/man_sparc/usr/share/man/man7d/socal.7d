.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapter is an SBus card which implements two full duplex Fibre Channel interfaces.  Each Fibre Channel interface can connect to a Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL).
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsocal\fR device driver is a nexus driver and implements portions of the FC-2 and FC-4 layers of FC-AL.
